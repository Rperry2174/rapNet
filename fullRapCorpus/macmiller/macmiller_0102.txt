<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Y’all is dead weight, less great, always gettin’ second place<br/>
I tend to race ahead of pace, dippin’ while I’m dressed in Bape<br/>
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain’t DiCaprio<br/>
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall<br/>
Capicola sandwich’s are tasty from Primanti’s<br/>
I’m a 5’7 giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning<br/>
Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning<br/>
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming<br/>
For a test that we ain’t study for, wonder will she love me more<br/>
With money, cause if not, I’m not sure what all this money for<br/>
Feelin’ like a hundred wars are goin’ on currently<br/>
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency<br/>
Poison, take this mercury, I’ll teach you for a learner’s fee<br/>
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak<br/>
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus<br/>
Actin’ like you fuckin’ with me, that’s some shit I can’t excuse<br/>
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe<br/>
You got a chance, don’t blow it like how a tuba works<br/>
I plan to do, somethin’ that ain’t tangible<br/>
Now I’m bout to hand it to<br/>
The homie Michael Rock, hear what he sayin’ to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]</i><br/>
Take a trip, took a molly out a bank a populari<br/>
And the word around the city is he sittin in a Ferrari<br/>
I told my self I wouldn’t get it, I’m sorry<br/>
That’s my bad, I party till my cardies get foggy<br/>
Can’t keep her hands off of me, got her locked, and lost the key<br/>
We smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then Carter one<br/>
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?<br/>
Not saying its coming soon, but I want the real show<br/>
Give me the treatment that you getting all them heels for<br/>
The shit they payin all the bills for<br/>
Man I missed it, that cake taste delicious<br/>
They can’t wait for vacations, paid for by pictures<br/>
I’m feeling good, I’m pulling bills I’m real as hell<br/>
I don’t front I roll blunts and papers<br/>
Don’t fuck with fakers<br/>
Your girl is asking me if I’mma take her<br/>
I’m straight though<br/>
You see I’m booked up til April<br/>
That’s mine, thats me, I take those<br/>
You try to see some peso’s than shake though<br/>
You get exactly what you paid for, stop acting like you can’t go<br/>
Swagging til the ankles<br/>
I feel you baby<br/>
Hopefully I look familiar, lately<br/>
<br/>
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love<br/>
But you’ll never ever get it because<br/>
It seem like it’ll only happen when I’m holding the drugs<br/>
You can never ever see it because<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one<br/>
First the plane land and then the bags come<br/>
We walking on this planet seeking action<br/>
Breaking girls hearts, sorry Miss Jackson<br/>
<br/>
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love<br/>
But you’ll never ever get it because<br/>
Seem like it’ll only happen when I’m holding the drugs<br/>
You can never ever see it<br/>
<br/>
And it won’t stop til the aliens fight the robots<br/>
And all the ladies take their clothes off<br/>
I’m here with Mikey and we gonna Rock<br/>
This some shit you won’t top<br/>
I said it won’t stop til the aliens fight the robots<br/>
And all the ladies take their clothes off<br/>
I’m here with Mikey and we gonna Rock<br/>
This some shit you won’t top<br/>
<br/>
I’m so high what you think about that babe<br/>
On some other shit, tell ‘em baby act crazy<br/>
Fifteen thousand, blow it on clothes<br/>
Six in the morning still sitting here throwed<br/>
I’m buggin’ out, buggin’ out, I wonder if they know<br/>
Pull up to the house, and I wonder if she know
