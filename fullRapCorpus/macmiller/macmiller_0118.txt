<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Close my eyes before I cross the street<br/>
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep<br/>
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep<br/>
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams<br/>
I'm in awe, this jigsaw, puzzle's not complete<br/>
I'm just an idea, nothing concrete<br/>
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines<br/>
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference<br/>
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know<br/>
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl<br/>
I don't mind those hatin' on my style<br/>
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low<br/>
I'm no god, I don't think that I'm a human, though cause I'm so odd<br/>
People sellin' drugs cause they can't find no job<br/>
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross<br/>
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons<br/>
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon<br/>
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on<br/>
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Somebody do somethin'<br/>
Somebody do somethin'<br/>
Somebody do somethin'<br/>
Somebody do somethin'<br/>
Somebody move somethin'<br/>
Somebody move somethin'<br/>
Somebody move somethin'<br/>
Somebody move somethin'<br/>
It ain't no party like aristocratic party<br/>
Said, it ain't no party like aristocratic party<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Sipping Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavouring<br/>
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it dangling<br/>
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton<br/>
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny<br/>
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby<br/>
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me<br/>
I ain't nobody, and neither are you<br/>
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth<br/>
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book<br/>
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look<br/>
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook<br/>
We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution<br/>
I'm down for the movement, trying not to lose it<br/>
Jewish Buddhist consume the views of Christianity<br/>
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup<br/>
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in an igloo<br/>
I hear the fish biting nice right now<br/>
I can't figure out life and feel right right now<br/>
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down<br/>
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown, poo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Somebody do somethin'<br/>
Somebody do somethin'<br/>
Somebody do somethin'<br/>
And... somebody move somethin'<br/>
Somebody move somethin'<br/>
You right there...<br/>
Somebody move somethin'<br/>
Somebody move somethin'
