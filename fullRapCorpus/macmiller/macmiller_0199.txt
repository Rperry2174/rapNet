<i>[Intro: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Around a fire doing a thunder dance<br/>
You know what's a funny word? Underpants<br/>
Let's go to Syria and have a war<br/>
Stop fucking calling me Macklemore<br/>
That's not my name, well kinda<br/>
It's kind of my name<br/>
(A little bit louder)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Yeah, so I sold the mansion and moved to my mom's attic<br/>
Life was a blockbuster but now it's a cult classic<br/>
Smoke 'til I'm asthmatic, embracing my bad habits<br/>
Travelling down the hall, I'm chasing a fast rabbit<br/>
Well that's acid, still weird from my last tablet<br/>
I love like a folk singer but fuck like a crack addict<br/>
Practicing black magic and watching some car crashes<br/>
Snapchattin' a dick pic and sent it to Bob Saget (I'm a faggot)<br/>
Word, the aliens have landed<br/>
I don't panic in my fortress made of granite<br/>
Take life for granted, probably won't when it ends<br/>
Thank God I'm sober again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Treejay]</i><br/>
Run away, run away<br/>
Run, run, run away<br/>
Oh my...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Who let the dogs out?<br/>
Stop what you're doing and put 'em back in the doghouse<br/>
I wasn't human, I'm feeling like I'm a god now<br/>
But most of the time I don't need to know what I'm talking 'bout<br/>
Bitch, I'm a walking, talking crocodile<br/>
Take a picture with my mom and crop her out<br/>
Go to her house, coked up, and lock her out<br/>
(Sorry about that)<br/>
I'm possibly a phony, don't believe me<br/>
You can't tell that I'm so lonely from the TV<br/>
I hate myself cause I'm a white rapper<br/>
I hate white rappers but an industry of kite masters made me rich<br/>
Short-shorts and high socks<br/>
I feel like chalk without a sidewalk<br/>
Back in the 'burgh I'mma eat at my favorite Thai spot<br/>
And smile as the hungry eyes watch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Yeah, still having sex with blind people (it feel good)<br/>
They say my pussy smell like pine needles (as it should)<br/>
Bust a nut in the poultry section at Giant Eagle<br/>
Stare a chicken in the face like, bitch, I'mma eat you<br/>
Yea, I'm all kinds of evil<br/>
Eating mushrooms out in London trynna find the Beatles<br/>
I'm still sick of people<br/>
Go back to saying, be a chief and kick it with Mr. Roedel<br/>
(That was my English teacher)<br/>
Retina display on my Macintosh<br/>
That's high definition jacking off<br/>
In LA trying to get me an acting job<br/>
Cause my idol David Hasselhoff<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Man, Germans love David Hasselhoff<br/>
I hear they like David Hasselhoff more than they like Jews<br/>
And they love Jews out there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Treejay]</i><br/>
Runaway, catch a plane<br/>
Know I did, ooh<br/>
Ooh, ooh<br/>
Runaway, Runaway, Runaway<br/>
Ooh, ooh<br/>
Girl, Runaway<br/>
You better run away
