Alright then, bitch<br/>
Ha, yeah, uhhhhh<br/>
A million mothafuckin' fans on that ass, biotch!<br/>
Feels amazin'!<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, I've always been the same kid, but now I'm famous<br/>
And I ain't even have to change shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey yo, they keep on sayin' this dude back, this dude back<br/>
But I don't sound like this dude, bitch I'm Mac<br/>
Now these girls all tryna suck my dick, I rap<br/>
I may let her if I'm sippin' that yak<br/>
Yeah, too fly, submarine in the sky<br/>
Can't go out in public I better get a disguise<br/>
It's better to be yourself, don't ever just slip a lie<br/>
While I'm drivin' with the top down, listenin' to Plies<br/>
Chicken wings and fries, I'm in love with all the simple things<br/>
Little things, soldiers be around always bickering<br/>
I got some money, threw some diamonds on a pinky ring<br/>
That's why your favorite girl probably on my ding a ling<br/>
Teeth blunts with peanut, standin' on a tree stump<br/>
Rappers need to keep up, my bitches double D cup<br/>
She fucks, but she ain't no slut and she know that<br/>
She freeze up, livin' in the moment get a Kodak<br/>
Hold that, wait for it to flash, get the picture<br/>
I ain't doing much, just out on this adventure<br/>
Bus around the country, but I'm travelin' the world<br/>
With all these rappers that be hating like I'm battlin' with girls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Hey yo this where the hook be<br/>
But I ain't got no hook you pussy<br/>
I said this where the hook be<br/>
But bitch I ain't got a fucking hook you pussy<br/>
Yeah bitch, that could be a hook<br/>
You know what I'ma rap<br/>
If it's OK with y'all<br/>
And you can tell me if it was nice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey yo I kinda want a fur coat, kinda want a grill<br/>
She met me at the party, now she kinda want to chill<br/>
I ain't on no pills, just a little weed, molly, and lean<br/>
Yeah I did a couple drugs, now they callin' me Sheen<br/>
This was all a dream just a week ago, now I got a heap of dough<br/>
I keep a ho, that always got some weed to roll<br/>
All these rappers wack but I don't ever see 'em close<br/>
The illest mothafucka in it we don't need to vote<br/>
Cause I don't give a fuck what y'all think<br/>
And I don't give a fuck what that dude on that blog think<br/>
Yeah I seen hay, been to court in 3 states<br/>
Had to deal with cheapskates, who always want a free play<br/>
You hold the weight of the world, I bet your knees break<br/>
Put my dick in a bitch hand, keepsake<br/>
You can't keep that, fuck off my case<br/>
You can keep some residue if I bust on your face<br/>
I'm just playin', mistakin' this Asian<br/>
Always been amazin', since days I've been hangin'<br/>
In ancient places, now the kid famous<br/>
And he ain't even have to change shit, biatch!<br/>
<br/>
A million motherfuckin' fans<br/>
Just want to take a second to thank y'all, you feel me?<br/>
Thanks for fuckin' with the kid from day one<br/>
You know what I'm saying, Blue Slide Park November 8th<br/>
I'll see y'all then alright<br/>
Chyaa<br/>
<br/>
Suck my dick<br/>
Hahahahaha<br/>
We should keep that<br/>
Ohh shit it worked again! Biotch!<br/>
So I just threw this fuckin' mixtape together cause I love y'all<br/>
How nice am I?
