Well<br/>
<br/>
Take your vitamins<br/>
<br/>
Well I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met the other day<br/>
While I was on my break, smokin' cigarettes<br/>
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me "come through, we should smoke"<br/>
Bring a pair of Lungs dont bring no money, baby I aint broke<br/>
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch<br/>
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor<br/>
The door had opened up and it was her<br/>
She told me hurry, come right in<br/>
Leave your shoes up by the FRONT CAUSE we just put new carpets in<br/>
She asked me 'bout my day and sat me down told me we should have some fun<br/>
There ain't nobody around<br/>
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work<br/>
Told me it will make my problems go away and fix the hurt<br/>
That I had, well, that don't sound bad, down the hatch<br/>
Kinda nervous, just relax, she said rubbing on my back<br/>
Well I ain't really into drugs but fuck it<br/>
I'm a take a trip and I'm a love it (love it)<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what happened to me<br/>
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free<br/>
It took me to somewhere off the map<br/>
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back<br/>
<br/>
Well I left right after that and started driving to my house where I reside<br/>
I was high and possibly a little fucked up in my mind<br/>
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house<br/>
I said fuck it, took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out<br/>
And it's funny cause I didn't even hit against the road<br/>
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own<br/>
I see colors, different colors, like they glowin' in the light<br/>
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark but it was bright<br/>
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take<br/>
If this kill me I'm a come back, haunt her every single day<br/>
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I've never seen<br/>
Feel like I'm forever dream, just imagine, set a scene<br/>
Power in imagination, got all my surroundings changing<br/>
Found a place to drown my brain to something like it's outer space<br/>
But nothing like the pictures of the astronauts they show me back at school<br/>
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man they had me fooled<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what happened to me<br/>
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free<br/>
It took me to somewhere off the map<br/>
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Excerpt from "Requiem For A Dream":]</i><br/>
I'm somebody, now, Harry. Everybody likes me. Soon, millions of people will see me, and they'll all like me. It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow alright.
