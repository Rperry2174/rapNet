<i>[Intro: Cam'Ron]</i><br/>
Another 7 AM session with Mac, high as a mutherfucker man<br/>
Edward EG just walked in, waddup baller!<br/>
Mac Miller in the building! Lemme tell you this lil story<br/>
Though real quick, about this ho<br/>
Excuse me ma, about this chick<br/>
This how it went down tho:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]</i><br/>
Baby says she sick of me, sick of me, you kidding me?<br/>
Fuck the fuckery, you comfort me, you diggin me?<br/>
Not Scooby Doo, boo-boo, no mystery<br/>
Not school, but I tell you the history<br/>
Wanted me to wife her, I just want to pipe her<br/>
Only gave her cab fare, I wouldn't white-Nik'd her<br/>
Baby won't quit tho, she a fighter<br/>
I'm like "God damn, it was just a one-nighter"<br/>
Don't know what I said to her<br/>
But now, the girl I'm deadin her<br/>
Caught the vapors, Schwarzenegger never seen this Predator<br/>
Venus a competitor, my cream and my cheddar-ar<br/>
See more tennis than Venus, Serena and Federer<br/>
Sergio Tacchinni Lamborghini, man etc<br/>
If life feels like a movie, I'll truly be your editor<br/>
Cam did it, your man live it, I ran with it<br/>
2 thousand dollar sweater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I tell 'em oh yeah, muthafucker, oh yeah<br/>
I'm getting money with my homies, yeah you know I'm gon share<br/>
Might get hard, I don't care, I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't scared<br/>
I got my peoples and they iller than yours is<br/>
So can you dig that? (dig that dig that)<br/>
Can you dig that? (dig that dig that) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I must admit it, I'm just iller than most<br/>
This business, I get up in it, like I'm pimpin' these hoes<br/>
All these that you people love, go 'head give em a toast<br/>
Because if they ain't here tomorrow you gon miss em the most<br/>
Now I'm livin' pretty good, yeah some would say phenomenal<br/>
All about my net like it's a goalie in a soccer goal<br/>
Accomplished the impossible, my dreams they seemed illogical<br/>
They ain't about that essay paper, I'mma tell 'em adios<br/>
Pass the phone bastards muthafucker, shouts to Vado too<br/>
Shmutty hoes been told me that they love me, that ain't nothin' new<br/>
Yeah that's nice you know my Twitter, no I ain't gone follow you<br/>
You prostitute, dirty bitch, I'll throw you down the laundry shoot<br/>
Like bada bing, bada boom, diamond rings, designer shoes<br/>
Finer things I like to do, London, France, and China too<br/>
Got a crib that got a view, above my yard that got a pool<br/>
Prolly tryna find me shit, too bad, I tell em:<br/>
<br/>
