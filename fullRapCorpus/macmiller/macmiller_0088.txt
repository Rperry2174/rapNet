<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I just be like fuck you, what you need?<br/>
You can’t get nothin’ from me<br/>
You was talkin’ shit, now I’m somebody you would love to be<br/>
I’ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me<br/>
You can keep on grillin’, I’ma smile back, smile back<br/>
(Just tell 'em Mac)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Call your army, bring your tanks, I’m a big boy with a big boy bank<br/>
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don’t take no breaks<br/>
Work until I get it, I bet it’s gon’ take a second<br/>
But once I start up my engine I’m gone, too fast to catch him<br/>
I’m Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink<br/>
What I’m on is strong, yours weaker than seven days<br/>
Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state<br/>
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade<br/>
Elevate, who the shit, cooler than what coolest is<br/>
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it<br/>
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin’, I’ma keep on doin’ it<br/>
Spend a day as me, boy you couldn’t get the shoes to fit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
I just be like fuck you, what you need?<br/>
You can’t get nothin’ from me<br/>
You was talkin’ shit, now I’m somebody you would love to be<br/>
I’ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me<br/>
You can keep on grillin’, I’ma smile back, smile back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick<br/>
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate<br/>
Rollie on my wrist, I ain’t rich, but I’m still coppin’ shit<br/>
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick<br/>
And bring it back<br/>
I could change the world with just a single track<br/>
Underage table in the back, smokin’, drinkin’ yak<br/>
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at<br/>
On the map, illest city out, I guess that’s just a fact<br/>
I’ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball<br/>
After all, only get one life, so there’s no time to stall<br/>
I’ma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with<br/>
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still with my boys I straight up grew with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
I just be like fuck you, what you need?<br/>
You can’t get nothin’ from me<br/>
You was talkin’ shit, now I’m somebody you would love to be<br/>
I’ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me<br/>
You can keep on grillin’, I’ma smile back, smile back
