Don't control yourself, <br/>
This your life you own it, said you own it. <br/>
So live it up.<br/>
All that matters is this moment so who's coming, don't control yourself. <br/>
This your life you own it, said you own it. <br/>
So live it up, all that matters is this moment<br/>
so who's coming, don't control yourself.<br/>
<br/>
All I got is a dream come true, everybody wonder what we gonn' do. <br/>
Drink in the red cup, pre roll ten blunts, when I go to sleep I don't think Imma get up. <br/>
Stay in bed till the afternoon, cause you know what us rappers do, get high, get drunk,<br/>
Then find some butt, girl, I wanna chase after you. <br/>
Lets live it up, live it up, party like we ain't got shit to do. <br/>
I don't give a fuck, give a fuck, nothin but cuttin up with the crew. <br/>
My parents out of town so we gonn' put it down.<br/>
We takin shots, who can go another round?<br/>
<br/>
Don't control yourself, <br/>
This your life you own it,said you own it. <br/>
So live it up. All that matters is this moment so who's<br/>
coming, don't control yourself. <br/>
This your life you own it, said you own it. <br/>
So live it up, all that matters is this moment,<br/>
so who's coming, don't control yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I wake and shit, the first thing Imma do is take a hit. <br/>
Tonights gonna be great, lets get a little drink, I'm trying to get wasted bitch.<br/>
Its gonna be something to remember, too bad we wont, wont,<br/>
and its gonna get hot in here so, don't bring your coat, coat. <br/>
Take your clothes off, we gonna get crazy.<br/>
She's sorta fine, just borderline, but tonight she's gonna be my lady! <br/>
My parents out of town so we gonn' put it down.<br/>
We takin' shots, who can go another round? <br/>
<br/>
Don't control yourself, <br/>
This your life you own it,said you own it. <br/>
So live it up.<br/>
All that matters is this moment so who's coming, don't control yourself. <br/>
This your life you own it, said you own it. <br/>
So live it up, all that matters is this moment<br/>
so who's coming, don't control yourself.
