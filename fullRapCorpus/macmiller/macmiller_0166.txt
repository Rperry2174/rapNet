The hallucinations have stopped, finally, thank God, but uh, my adrenaline reserves are burning out and I'm staring straight into the face of a total psychotic freako<br/>
<br/>
And if by chance it's my grand finale<br/>
Bury me in Allegheny County<br/>
It's the, the most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged<br/>
Don't beg, gross gang, smell like old lo-mein<br/>
Shit, the flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave<br/>
Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation<br/>
The most strangest, master of the ceremonies<br/>
A fifth of Stoli then itâ€™s only Cher and Moby karaoke<br/>
My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley<br/>
Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation<br/>
And no famous friends for me, just old faces<br/>
I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath<br/>
Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead<br/>
No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address<br/>
Self medicate, self education<br/>
Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Let us have a grand finale<br/>
The world will be just fine without me<br/>
And I don't got a smile on his face<br/>
Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang<br/>
Are you ready for the fireworks?<br/>
It was a silent night 'til the fireworks<br/>
<br/>
I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads<br/>
God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl<br/>
We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport<br/>
He booted Nostradamus, turned water into wine<br/>
But he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet<br/>
Even God will one day be forgotten<br/>
And recently I've been feelin', I've been feelin' like<br/>
It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss<br/>
Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white<br/>
Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?<br/>
I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive<br/>
Mixin' uppers and downers, practically suicide<br/>
My old Jewish mind, REMember music will be fine<br/>
And I make my own peace now, if you behind<br/>
Hallucination's how I use my mind<br/>
Who am I?<br/>
<br/>
