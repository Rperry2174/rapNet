<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
When I was just a kid<br/>
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich<br/>
No more problems and no more tricks<br/>
I set my sights high cause in my life time...<br/>
Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to God<br/>
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit<br/>
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller &amp; Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish<br/>
What's a life if you never take a risk?<br/>
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
In my life time, my whole M.O. was to get this M.O.N.E.Y<br/>
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)<br/>
Long story short, that's one of my long term goals<br/>
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old<br/>
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang<br/>
I done seen some spooky things through these gucci shades<br/>
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums<br/>
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade<br/>
But can't we all just get along?<br/>
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day<br/>
She say "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"<br/>
I say I know, roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)<br/>
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash<br/>
Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo) Our Anarchy is our NR key<br/>
Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze<br/>
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia<br/>
Soul!<br/>
<br/>

Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god<br/>
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit<br/>

Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I've seen some shit<br/>
How'd I end up in a place like this?<br/>
Swear to god, seen some shit<br/>
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is<br/>
<br/>
In this life time, be the time of your life<br/>
It's been a while, but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike<br/>
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest<br/>
Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative<br/>
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park<br/>
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes<br/>
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize<br/>
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long<br/>
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish<br/>
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger<br/>
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer<br/>
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure<br/>
I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer<br/>
What a fine act you got for, I don't know why what I get soo high for<br/>
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma<br/>
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes<br/>
There was a time...<br/>
<br/>
When I was just a kid<br/>
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich<br/>
No more problems and no more tricks<br/>
I set my sights high cause In my life time...<br/>
Man, I've seen some shit, I swear to god<br/>
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit<br/>
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?<br/>
<br/>
Take your time<br/>
Don't close your eyes<br/>
Life happens in a flash<br/>
And you don't wanna miss that<br/>
<br/>

What's a life if you never take a risk?<br/>
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun<br/>
<br/>

How'd I end up in a place like this?<br/>
Swear to god, seen some shit<br/>
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller &amp; Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
We all grow up to be gangstas, playas, snitches<br/>
Freaks and strangers, politicians<br/>
Good and evil people<br/>
Sinners, saints and everything in between<br/>
Lately I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'<br/>
What's the difference? What's the difference?<br/>
Nothing at all!<br/>
Aye, let me just add one more thing, Josh<br/>
(Watch that shit man, you almost burnt me nigga!)
