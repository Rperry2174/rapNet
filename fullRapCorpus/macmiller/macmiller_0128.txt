<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Light up till the pain gone<br/>
All I hear is this same song when the radio came on<br/>
Fuck around and get based on<br/>
Do this shit till the day I die<br/>
Are you ready? Are you ready?<br/>
Terrified but my hand is steady<br/>
Verified get the camera ready<br/>
Carry my own weight all these earthquakes don't wake<br/>
Me up from this deep sleep diving into this cold lake<br/>
Fuck a bitch 'til her toes shake telling me I'm her soul mate<br/>
Disguised emotion no face bull shit with that no thanks<br/>
Dealing with her since 08 fucked around I'm done<br/>
I heard you're supposed to race when you hear the sound of that gun<br/>
Now it's losing all of it's fun spending days in solitude<br/>
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood<br/>
Not thinking logical, getting high jump off the moon<br/>
Looked into his soul when he died right there in the hospital<br/>
Peace don't seem possible when the mind is so closed<br/>
Came in for your money then left with all of your hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow<br/>
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know (Oh!)<br/>
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Whoa!)<br/>
You hurt so good<br/>
Girl your love, it hurts so good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh love me love me that Fentanyl it numb me<br/>
Beautiful to get ugly turn you into a junkie<br/>
Still searching for something but I don't know what<br/>
Dreaming about nothing wake you up and then fuck<br/>
I love it when you get a little nasty<br/>
Hit it from the back if you like that wiggle them ass cheeks<br/>
Isn't that sweet same shit we did last week<br/>
For all the cash you might of stood up and would've walked past me<br/>
Wake me up from this bad dream put a match to this gasoline<br/>
Every night you somebody different got me thinking it's Halloween<br/>
Fucked up can't feel myself work hard might kill myself<br/>
Exist through audio where all my problems they're real as hell<br/>
Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like Splinter Cell<br/>
Getting high put my mind away find the words I'm tryna say<br/>
Imma think of that later when the world goes against you<br/>
You better get that paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow<br/>
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know (Oh!)<br/>
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Whoa!)<br/>
You hurt so good<br/>
Girl your love, it hurts so good
