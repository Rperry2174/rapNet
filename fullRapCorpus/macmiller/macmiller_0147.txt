Yeah, yeah<br/>
Umm... uh...<br/>
Ladies and gentleman<br/>
Yeah, whew, that drip<br/>
Yeah, okay<br/>
<br/>
Writing on writer's block, haven't slept in days<br/>
They wanna put me in the psycho watch<br/>
Everyone's afraid of what I do inside my studio<br/>
Worried I'mma lose control<br/>
They ruffling my feathers and they shuffling the Yu-Gi-Oh<br/>
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne<br/>
Uno, dos, bitch I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though<br/>
(My brain fried, always chasing the same high<br/>
I'm so fucked up to function, do nothing but waste time)<br/>
Woke up annihilated, lying on the pavement<br/>
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape<br/>
And I know that it's Friday, cause every Friday they have a parade<br/>
In-front of city hall, hear them celebrate, they having a ball<br/>
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated<br/>
I'm lost inside a giant matrix<br/>
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious<br/>
Jump above the come down<br/>
I'm strung out and not in ops inside the dugout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't be scared just come with me<br/>
It feels so good to be this free<br/>
What are you afraid of? Tell me what you're made of!<br/>
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust!<br/>
Just a little Angel dust!<br/>
It's just a little angel dust!<br/>
<br/>
I'm playing hot potato on a Winnebago<br/>
The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso<br/>
And what's an angel with a missing halo<br/>
She will drop out of school to take a trip to day glow<br/>
Found a twenty laying by the sewer rats<br/>
You know little Stewart hasn't been in any movies lately<br/>
He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex<br/>
His agent working hard to book him a commercial<br/>
What I do should not concern you<br/>
Do this till I turn blue<br/>
Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin<br/>
Curses, turn 'em into bird food<br/>
Hurried to make the first move<br/>
I'm walking like Herschel<br/>
Now we at the end of verse two<br/>
Uh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Don't fuck with the angel dust<br/>
Don't fuck with the angel dust<br/>
Please don't fuck with the angel dust<br/>
Oh! Please don't fuck with the angel dust!
