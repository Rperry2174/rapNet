<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yeah... <i>[gun shot]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear (I swear)<br/>
But now she's dead and there ain't no coming back once you there (there)<br/>
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared (I cared)<br/>
Your food getting cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair (chair)<br/>
We can talk about all the things we should have done<br/>
All the arguments that you probably would have won (have won)<br/>
But I'm stubborn baby, you knew that when you told me you loved me<br/>
And I told you I loved you back (loved you back)<br/>
But now you laying on the tile, I'm waiting for a smile<br/>
So I'll stay here for a while, when the cops come in<br/>
They're gonna have to take me away (away)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And I'll tell em, "I'm sorry<br/>
I didn't mean to do it"<br/>
Guess I'm just emotional<br/>
And maybe kinda stupid<br/>
I just wanna hold you close<br/>
So why do I have to give you away<br/>
<i>[gun shot, scream]</i><br/>
And I'll tell em, I'm sorry<br/>
I'm not a bad person<br/>
I couldn't take your pain away<br/>
I guess I'm undeserving<br/>
But if I cant have you to myself<br/>
Then you're, gone (gone)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[gun shot]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear (I swear)<br/>
Life full of surprises, but that shit isn't fair (isn't fair)<br/>
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare (rare)<br/>
If you getting cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair (chair)<br/>
We can talk about everything you hate on this Earth (Earth)<br/>
And that you're getting tired, cause you making it work (work)<br/>
But can I kiss you just one more time (time)<br/>
Baby lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touching mine (touching mine)<br/>
I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly (heavenly)<br/>
Now I'm rubbing on your back, whispering rest in peace (rest in peace)<br/>
It's okay baby, go to sleep (go to sleep)<br/>
I'll keep you safe, you alone with me <br/>
Say I wouldn't hurt you, I lied<br/>
I don't deserve you, I tried<br/>
So I'm a stay by your side (side)<br/>
But when the cops come in<br/>
They're gonna have to take me away (away)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And I'll tell em, "I'm sorry<br/>
I didn't mean to do it"<br/>
Guess I'm just emotional<br/>
And maybe kinda stupid<br/>
I just wanna hold you close<br/>
So why do I have to give you away<br/>
<i>[gun shot, scream]</i><br/>
And I'll tell em, I'm sorry<br/>
I'm not a bad person<br/>
I couldn't take your pain away<br/>
I guess I'm undeserving<br/>
But if I cant have you to myself<br/>
Then you're, gone (gone)<br/>
