<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Uh, $ign<br/>
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no ($ign)<br/>
Ayy<br/>
<br/>
I been waitin' all night for this moment<br/>
I been waitin' all year for this moment<br/>
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me<br/>
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you<br/>
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home<br/>
Cinderella better get your ass home<br/>
Man I swear the parents just don't understand<br/>
You ain't gotta be old to be a man<br/>
Take my hand, come with me to my room<br/>
Girl I got a suite at the SLS<br/>
I already know you got expensive taste<br/>
Take my hand, follow me to my room<br/>
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright<br/>
Girl I got a plan for the whole night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Okay your legs like a store they open up<br/>
And you got people in the aisle<br/>
Been here every night for weeks at a time<br/>
You in my dreams that's why I sleep all the time<br/>
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you<br/>
Just to leave you behind<br/>
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine<br/>
This the type of thing I heard it happen all the time<br/>
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly<br/>
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high<br/>
Said nothin' better than the first time<br/>
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside<br/>
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry<br/>
Wet you like a fresh beau coop, second and a third time<br/>
Left you up a verse mind<br/>
And when you hungry I can chef you up some stir fry<br/>
Get you some dessert wine, elevate this third eye<br/>
First prize, Nobel, get a piece<br/>
Your clothes off, turn around, let me see<br/>
<br/>

I been waitin' all year for this moment<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Yeah, okay I came up where the planet was<br/>
Take you by the hand<br/>
And bring you somewhere where the sand is<br/>
Soon as we landed<br/>
We went straight into the room<br/>
And played the music and started dancing<br/>
You was taking off your pants<br/>
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore<br/>
I do you like a chore<br/>
We started on the bed and then we moved onto the floor<br/>
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore<br/>
I thought you was an angel now you yellin' to the Lord<br/>
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type<br/>
Now you always wanna spend the night<br/>
Now I'm doing everything you like<br/>
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right<br/>
Yeah, but I still respect the game<br/>
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight<br/>
The sex is great, for heavens sake I need it every day<br/>
I yell your name, Cinderella<br/>
Never gonna find nobody better<br/>
All my life...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla Sign:]</i><br/>
I been waitin' all night for this moment<br/>
I been waitin' all year for this moment<br/>
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me<br/>

Cinderella better get your ass home<br/>
Man I swear the parents just don't understand<br/>
You ain't gotta be old to be a man<br/>

Girl I got a suite at the SLS<br/>

Take my hand, follow me to my room<br/>
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright<br/>
Girl I got a plan for the whole night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Hey now, I'm saying<br/>
My only way out is the way in<br/>
I won't stop 'til you're mine, no way<br/>
Well all my days now, they changin'<br/>
I got angels, no more Satan<br/>
Looks like God's on my side, this time<br/>
Well, I been meanin' to tell you<br/>
You lookin' better every day<br/>
Write you letters<br/>
It's only right that right after love, I write my name<br/>
If it's forever or never it's all the same<br/>
Under the weather<br/>
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain, yeah<br/>
Ooh Cinderella, don't you run out of time<br/>
It feels like you've been taking all day<br/>
Wherever you came from, wherever you going<br/>
I promise I'm not far behind, yeah<br/>
So don't you dare throw this away<br/>
I been meanin' to tell you<br/>
You lookin' better every day<br/>
Write you letters<br/>
It's only right that right after love, I write my name<br/>
If it's forever or never it's all the same<br/>
Under the weather<br/>
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain
