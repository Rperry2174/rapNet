<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
As I spend another night with out a single thing to do<br/>
Cept' writin down this music I precede to bring to you<br/>
My man Billy hit me up he got some weed he bringin through<br/>
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of swishers too<br/>
That's what usually happens Deserve some cool relaxin<br/>
Smokin herb and laughin at Curb Your Enthusiasm<br/>
I'm just a regular kid at my crib doin regular shit burnin 5 spliffs<br/>
I'm so high another night alone so I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone<br/>
I'm gone you ain't gonna bring me back<br/>
So gone couldn't tell you where I'm at<br/>
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh<br/>
You wanna find me hit me on Twitter<br/>
Well that sound mad lame<br/>
People love me they don't even know my last name<br/>
Waitin at the station till it's time that I can board the train<br/>
Headin to the fortune fame should explore my brain<br/>
See what I'm thinkin bout, pour a little liquor then I drink it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause it's just another night on my own layin back as I light up my dro<br/>
It's just another night alone... I spend another night alone<br/>
Said cause it's just another night on my own layin back as I light up my dro<br/>
It's just another night alone... I spend another night alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I turn my phone on silent I need to get away<br/>
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play<br/>
I thank god for blessing me with life every day<br/>
And to my peoples who've gone we'll meet at heaven's gate<br/>
I've been sellin haze but I'm sure there's better ways<br/>
That I can get my pay I just need to get it straight<br/>
Nothin left to say now it's time for action<br/>
No more bullshit no more relaxin<br/>
Rapping's my passion so I stay writin<br/>
Spend a couple nights in burn out all the lights in my room<br/>
Stuck in my crib like glue<br/>
That's what I do it's nothin new<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause it's just another night on my own layin back as I light up my dro<br/>
It's just another night alone... I spend another night alone<br/>
Said it's just another night on my own layin back as I light up my dro<br/>
It's just another night alone... I spend another night alone
