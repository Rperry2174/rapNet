<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I give no fucks when I go nuts, cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa: Dead<br/>
Woke up from the coma pulled up in a Skoda smoked, went back to bed<br/>
Never thought it would be such a loner, I tell my bitch that I fucking own her<br/>
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog, I'ma run it over, I'm a fucking soldier<br/>
So cold bro fuck pneumonia, all my bitches got love for Sosa, I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta then disappear in Southern California<br/>
Strung out to the night, I'm chilling, everybody worried the lights might kill them<br/>
Via sight slipping, long lines of those white women<br/>
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows<br/>
Just went through the half ounce of coke, blood pouring out my nose<br/>
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem, I'm fucking high<br/>
We publicize, when the sun go down I come alive<br/>
Cause the guns go off in the summer time, cause the guns go off in the summer time<br/>
Blaow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
This another motherfucking rap song<br/>
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long<br/>
Spent all my cash on a broken dream<br/>
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean<br/>
All I got's this mansion and this potpourri<br/>
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?<br/>
Don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper<br/>
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily<br/>
Getting wasted as the time that I'm spending high and sedated<br/>
I'm putting five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit<br/>
As soon as it's flashing lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes<br/>
I do this shit out of spite cause there's niggas that overlooked me forever<br/>
I'm more content with dark and stormier weather<br/>
Flip the fucking cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better<br/>
But here's a toast to your efforts, and don't approach me with nothing<br/>
That isn't money or breakfast, I'm close to choking a pussy, pussy<br/>
Sweaty Man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him<br/>
With a couple niggas, weighing sess like it's a lot options<br/>
15 on me for soda and swishers<br/>
And who's the shit, a bag of chips, and a colon decleanser?<br/>
I'm over bitches trying to act like I owe 'em a picture<br/>
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol<br/>
Listen, ST was the older initials<br/>
Been rap game tighter than boa constricters<br/>
Rolling stoned like a boulder raving, I'm so impatient and going dumb as<br/>
Disclosing my fucking home location to total strangers<br/>
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink<br/>
Cashing out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think<br/>
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick<br/>
And my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me adrift<br/>
<br/>
