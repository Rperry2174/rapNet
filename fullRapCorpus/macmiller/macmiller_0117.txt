<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Passport, filling it up with stamps<br/>
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan<br/>
She keep on asking for a rack so I ran<br/>
Looking back, like you can't see who I am<br/>
Think my bitch don't know me no more<br/>
Cause every time she's sad I can't console her no more<br/>
If money buy you love, then love's not enough<br/>
So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor<br/>
If you had the chance, would you take the time you need to make it right?<br/>
The clouds are gray but would you pay the price to paint them white?<br/>
Might have a baby on the way, cause I been going in raw<br/>
It feels better, that real pleasure<br/>
I'm not real, I think I never was<br/>
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch<br/>
I need to feel that (love)<br/>
I need to feel that (pain)<br/>
My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that (rain)<br/>
I keep my head up (high)<br/>
A little fed up (lies)<br/>
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP<br/>
I don't exist<br/>
Hieroglyphics<br/>
Pyrotechnics<br/>
Metaphysics<br/>
Telekinetics put 50k on my credit card<br/>
Looking for answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far<br/>
Let's get it on, I'm real like Tenenbaums in Lebanon<br/>
Decepticons, hit it 'til my head is gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Point me to the road, and I'ma run it<br/>
Bloodhound with my nose to the money<br/>
Ain't fucking with these hoes<br/>
Getting duckets 'til I die<br/>
While my foes busy running, fuck it<br/>
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toast it in public<br/>
Head in the clouds, my toes in the struggle<br/>
Like who didn't test yet? Test this<br/>
Few new rules in effect, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
See this a rather spooky action movie<br/>
Roll it up and pass it to me<br/>
Hashing booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bougie<br/>
See a creature, ass beauty<br/>
Need a feature, rather shoot me<br/>
Truly bitches must have them bad jeans in bag of Coogi<br/>
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming<br/>
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming<br/>
Back to doing cash pursuing<br/>
Posted up like Patrick Ewing<br/>
Rapper fuser, sad if you would battle for a stack or two<br/>
These eloquent, irrelevant sentences show my penmanship<br/>
Indefinite boundaries, show you the end of it<br/>
Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices<br/>
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly<br/>
He and I are not the same<br/>
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain<br/>
Money in machines, those will make you change<br/>
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain<br/>
But I can't complain<br/>
<br/>

While my foes busy running, fuck it<br/>
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toast it in public<br/>
Head in the clouds, my toes in the struggle<br/>
Like who didn't test yet? Test this<br/>
Few new rules in effect, bitch
