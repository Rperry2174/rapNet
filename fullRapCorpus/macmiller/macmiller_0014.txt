Uh,<br/>
Homie I remember everything,<br/>
Every single blunt lit,<br/>
Me and my homies we was all up on that dumb shit,<br/>
Hittin' that one lick,<br/>
Gettin' us dumb rich,<br/>
Bein' extra sneaky not leavin' thumb prints,<br/>
There was little Mac killin' packs of fun dip,<br/>
And my people that been with us since the young kid,<br/>
Gettin' caught by my pops blowin' haze.<br/>
..smokin' blunts from my younger through my older days,<br/>
Nothin' goes to waste,<br/>
Not a day was smashed,<br/>
There was doe to make,<br/>
And we was makin' cash,<br/>
Bangin' rap till the neighbors called the cops,<br/>
Beatin' dudes up throwin' mollywops,<br/>
Some people say that I'm all just talk,<br/>
But I'll tell you everything about the block I walked,<br/>
I wasn't cookin' pot, I wasn't tokin' guns,<br/>
But I was lookin' high, stayin' smokin' blunts.<br/>
Yeah I stole a little bit boy nothin' was cheap,<br/>
Santa stayed puttin' that coal under my tree,<br/>
And this is peace to my people and peace to my enemies,<br/>
But nothin' keeps me alive like my memories...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You make me feel alive, "These memories keep me alive",<br/>
You are my highest light, "These memories keepin' me high",<br/>
You make me feel alive, "These memories keep me alive",<br/>
You are my highest light, "These memories keepin' me high",<br/>
<br/>
But lets get back to the good ones,<br/>
We was just chasin' some women,<br/>
Runnin' the game before we playin' an inning,<br/>
Now we need that cake to the ceiling,<br/>
Cook in the kitchen,<br/>
But these, haters is grillin' fill the place up with villains,<br/>
Cause we all just chillin' now,<br/>
Got the illest crowed,<br/>
Raisin' the roof, uh, breakin' the ceiling down,<br/>
I'm iller now then when yall first heard me,<br/>
Peace to the people who listened past the first week,<br/>
And there's a lot of yall,<br/>
So let me take a vow,<br/>
This to memories,<br/>
The drinks is on the house,<br/>
We came a long damn way from sittin' on the couch,<br/>
Peace to all my honies that was takin' off their blouse,<br/>
You'll miss me when I'm out,<br/>
Don't leave me when I'm gone,<br/>
You hatin' fourty-year-olds I'm peein' on your lawn,<br/>
I treat you like a jon,<br/>
The way I treat a beat,<br/>
This ain't everything, but I'll let you sneak a peak.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
