<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I cordially invite you to performances in Normandy<br/>
I formally was more of a morally well-rounded human<br/>
Zooming through this industry, booming with opportune movements<br/>
I moved units, we, the new Christ and new Judas<br/>
Priest when I feast on these beats I'm producin'<br/>
This mind that I'm losing, got time that I'm watching passing<br/>
Think you had it bout up to here with my obnoxious ass<br/>
Bought an apple out the rotten batch<br/>
Your little sister probably kill you for my autograph (pow)<br/>
I tell a bitch sample the misogyny<br/>
All black Benz but the inside mahogany<br/>
Comedy, drop bombs, and humbly kill shit<br/>
You got that one homie, you be fucking with pills with<br/>
The illness, medicated natural phosphor<br/>
Sip a cold lager just to turn to Kevin Cosner<br/>
Dip out in a tripped out flying saucer<br/>
Head out to the jungle sippin' ayahuasca<br/>
Say it's bad luck to go and sit in a casket<br/>
So me and my homies we be spitting that whack shit, only<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Am I rolling<br/>
Would you wash the feet of ugly Jesus<br/>
When he's coming for your pontoon boat<br/>
Everybody's going to jail this time
