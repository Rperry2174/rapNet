<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, 10,000 dollar hands, million dollar plan<br/>
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am<br/>
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly<br/>
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy<br/>
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by<br/>
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry<br/>
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds<br/>
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in<br/>
Autograph signin' must've got to my head<br/>
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mofucka<br/>
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick<br/>
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with<br/>
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy<br/>
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys<br/>
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys<br/>
These random strangers just treatin' me like weed? boys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Pennsylvania nights, 9:30 flights<br/>
Thinking to myself, where does all this go?<br/>
No time to care, more I can share<br/>
By now, this life is all I know<br/>
So this is all I know, this is all I know<br/>
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight<br/>
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit<br/>
So make a toast to the good life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, hey, 10,000 dollar hands, billion dollar plan<br/>
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van<br/>
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code<br/>
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo!<br/>
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss<br/>
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a molotov<br/>
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop<br/>
Thinkin' bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust<br/>
Got me thankful just for life by itself<br/>
And there's way more people here I should be tryna to help<br/>
And my moms is spendin' money how I do, probably yes<br/>
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest<br/>
You got ya thumb held high, we can be friends<br/>
Other people pretend, we hang out on the weekends<br/>
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them<br/>
Say get some rest, when I die, I'mma sleep in<br/>
<br/>
