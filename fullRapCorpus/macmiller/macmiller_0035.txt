Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?<br/>
Cause' it's nice out and we could get high<br/>
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right<br/>
We outside, We outside (Hey, Hey, Hey)<br/>
<br/>
I wake up, throw on some clothes and out the door I won't be back<br/>
My shinin' sun horizon settin up a lovely backdrop<br/>
My life's a topic of a lullabye<br/>
(Ah) A breath of fresh air, is something right<br/>
I don't wanna be inside today,<br/>
Just keep it rollin like we ridin' skates<br/>
I got a happy of haze.<br/>
I'm thinkin we gon' get high today,<br/>
And let the sun shine all in my face.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah this life is good, don't let it all go to waste<br/>
Just walk outside the door to get your mom off your case.<br/>
Yeah, free livin', I swear, I be on some hippie shit.<br/>
But gettin way fresher than the hippies is.<br/>
<br/>
I got the, the gift of gab, somethin that you wish you had,<br/>
Don't even get a strap naw I'd rather kick a rap<br/>
Enjoy the place that you livin' at stay around<br/>
We just some kids and this world is a playground<br/>
<br/>
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?<br/>
Cause' it's nice out and we could get high<br/>
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right<br/>
We could post outside for the night<br/>
<br/>
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?<br/>
Cause' it's nice out and we could get high<br/>
Oh yeah the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right<br/>
We outside, outside<br/>
<br/>
When I be on some kid shit, gon take my shorty on a picnic<br/>
And everyday feelin like it's Christmas<br/>
The kinda weather had by people livin' so priviledged<br/>
I know the Lord Take, today he was tryna giveth<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, ey, rich or poor, a sunny day a sunny day,<br/>
We start the madness as soon as we hit the month of May,<br/>
Rain, Rain, Go away, Waitin for my homie Mr. Sun to come our way.<br/>
<br/>
Little kids runnin' through the streets playin,<br/>
Papi on the porch he ain't got time to waste it.<br/>
He's just a old man in the sea, Ernest Hemmingway,<br/>
Elevate, look up in the sky starin Heaven Space.<br/>
Second grade, holdin down the corner slangin' lemonade,<br/>
Everyday hustlin', you ridin' down penny lane.<br/>
You ain't gonna get a day like this,<br/>
So put the rest of your troubles with that goodnight kiss<br/>
<br/>
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?<br/>
Cause' it's nice out and we could get high<br/>
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right<br/>
We could post outside for the night<br/>
<br/>
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?<br/>
Cause' it's nice out and we could get high<br/>
Oh yeah the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right<br/>
We outside, outside<br/>
<br/>
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?<br/>
Cause' it's nice out and we could get high<br/>
Feel the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right<br/>
We could post outside for the night<br/>
<br/>
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?<br/>
Cause' it's nice out and we could get high<br/>
Oh yeah the sun shinin' and I'm feelin right<br/>
We outside, outside
