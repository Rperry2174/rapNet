<i>[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Ever since a nigga had recess<br/>
Motherfucker felt like a grown-up (Soulo)<br/>
Momma come and bitch about a curfew<br/>
I was still playing round the corner<br/>
7 years old saw my first porno<br/>
Damn that fucked me up<br/>
At 10 I bust my first nut<br/>
On this older ho gut, but so what<br/>
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid<br/>
I'm living too fast, sin is a habit<br/>
I can't hack fornicate, act as rabid<br/>
One bean short of an acid tablet<br/>
Security guards spark my cigarettes<br/>
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew<br/>
Sometimes them Koreans be cool<br/>
These shades make me look 22<br/>
They say you learn when you get older<br/>
I just say that that ain't true<br/>
That just means when you was younger<br/>
You ain't get turnt up like us fool<br/>
Just got L's so I'm riding high<br/>
Still in high school but I do<br/>
Everything I will do<br/>
When I'm 25, no lie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I was young with ambition<br/>
F*cked around with these hoes<br/>
Never needed permission<br/>
Went and lived the life that I chose<br/>
Premonition type visions, see the world as it goes<br/>
Tell them all what they missing<br/>
While I watch as it unfolds<br/>
Dodging my death<br/>
Confident kid I was trying to grow up with the best<br/>
Watching my step<br/>
Never know college but could find me nodding off always on test-day<br/>
I coulda been a great graduate<br/>
Woulda got one of those hoes from the Bachelor<br/>
Coulda been smart, coulda been a doctor<br/>
Life full of drama, little soap opera<br/>
Falling in love, like she woulda caught ya<br/>
Almost got her knocked up, woulda been a father<br/>
All about energy, make good memories<br/>
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama<br/>
Only 18 but I got my own business<br/>
Then I got fame like what the fuck is this<br/>
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches<br/>
Everyone around wanna treat me all different<br/>
Oh I'm cool? Cause I got money<br/>
Back in high school none of the hoes was tryna fuck me<br/>
I thought it was a conspiracy<br/>
Sometimes my thoughts are scaring me<br/>
You a parody, hilarity, that funny sh*t for the parakeets<br/>
<br/>
They, they, they was looking for somebody like me<br/>
Big bag of weed and a money heist scheme<br/>
Something brand new, wonder what it might be<br/>
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed<br/>
<br/>
If you 18 years and older<br/>
18 years and older<br/>
If you 18 years and older<br/>
18 years and older<br/>
<br/>
Take care of my family, take care of my girl<br/>
Plant a couple seeds, raising into tress<br/>
Went to see a rated R movie about me<br/>
They said you must be<br/>
18 years and older <i>[x5]</i>
