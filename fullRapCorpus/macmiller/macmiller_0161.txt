<i>[Intro: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Who put the spiders in my apple sauce?<br/>
Took the pins out my hand grenade?<br/>
Somebody said that I deserve to die<br/>
I looked him in the eye and said the devil's not circumcised<br/>
Who put spiders in my apple sauce?<br/>
Took the pins out my hand grenade?<br/>
Somebody told that I deserve to die<br/>
I looked him in the eye and said the devil not circumcised<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
So play me a song on the guitar<br/>
Got a rainforest in my cigar<br/>
There's knots in my yo-yo string<br/>
Put a crown on my stallion, I'm the Polo king<br/>
I fell in love with a go-go dancer, she's a single mom<br/>
The underdog, I like to play the game with Diddy Kong<br/>
She the god type, throw that bitch a Klondike<br/>
Everything is alright, see it's written in the Psalms<br/>
I told her I get rich off my little songs<br/>
Gave her a billion reasons that she should come along<br/>
Immediately, she dropped her shit<br/>
But everywhere I go, they tell me "Watch your bitch!"<br/>
God damn! I guess I got another one<br/>
Good vibrations, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch<br/>
I put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt<br/>
Got my head underwater but I ain't comin' up<br/>
Fuck air, my bitch's ass is like a plump pear<br/>
And she ain't pretty or ugly, I say she's just fair<br/>
Man this life is unfair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Okay I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to lose<br/>
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two<br/>
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?<br/>
I said I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to do<br/>
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two<br/>
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I'm readin' old Playboy magazines<br/>
Somethin' from the 50's when the journalism had it's peak<br/>
You play the background, you just a member of the faculty<br/>
I'm actually out here decision makin'<br/>
Had to get my shit together, I was missin' payments<br/>
I just pray to God that my lady isn't famous<br/>
She threw the gown on and we hit the banquet<br/>
She got her own stories, just let the bitch explain it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mike Jones]</i><br/>
Mac, I think the girl that you speakin' 'bout<br/>
Was in fact the same chick, late night, creepin' out<br/>
Sneakin' out, my homie knew it, told me keep an eye<br/>
Found out she was twerkin', found out she wasn't workin'<br/>
The whole game switched when my man hit<br/>
Got me rollin' in a circle, top down, blowin' purple<br/>
Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle<br/>
Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle<br/>
Swang, switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'<br/>
Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin'<br/>
Mike Jones, switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'<br/>
Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin'<br/>
<br/>
