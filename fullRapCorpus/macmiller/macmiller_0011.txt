<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
I know you gotta feel this<br/>
I'm on some real shit,<br/>
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit<br/>
I know you gotta feel this<br/>
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit,<br/>
I'm on some real shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Pull the hoodie down<br/>
And take a look around<br/>
Sounds that shook a town<br/>
Man it feel good to smile<br/>
So I shouldn't frown<br/>
When the night is looking down<br/>
Mirror, mirror on the wall<br/>
Who's the smoothest crook around?<br/>
Takin' some dollas<br/>
And makin' away from Impalas<br/>
Shakin' and jade cause they chasin' the face of a robber<br/>
Actin' goofy, absolutely<br/>
Cause my passion suits me<br/>
So blast the tunes please<br/>
I see the world with four eyes<br/>
Hip-hop tour guide<br/>
Hear the war cries: rap or die<br/>
I just wanna get signed<br/>
Drive a four door ride<br/>
Be more fly, 'till then I'll just soar by<br/>
With a wave<br/>
I'm a bad indicate<br/>
Sit back in the shade<br/>
While I'm passin' the haze<br/>
Misbehave and I'm a trouble-making teenager<br/>
Be prayful he doesn't favor to please haters<br/>
Seat taken, three turn Mayor<br/>
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later<br/>
Uh, I've seen greater days<br/>
So let the haters play their game<br/>
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey<br/>
The ace of spade can make it's way to save the day<br/>
But from the start a club of heart was diamond<br/>
Now I'm in Zion flying through the skyline<br/>
The game on my back I got 5 spines<br/>
Black cat with 9 lives, time flies<br/>
By so I got one life to loose it<br/>
But how will I use it?<br/>
Uhhh, I put it all in the music<br/>
Cause y'all pussies<br/>
Fold away before they hand the cards<br/>
Broke-ass rappin' now you Dancin' With The Stars<br/>
I'm handling these bars like a simple situation<br/>
Based on the cats who don't fit in the equation<br/>
<br/>
Patience is a virtue but fuck it I want it now<br/>
Get my record deal ready put Diddy up on the dial like<br/>
"Hello, wassup Puffy<br/>
I'm on my grind and hungry<br/>
Throw me on the table they gonna love me, trust me"<br/>
Cause these older cats are gettin' a little rusty<br/>
It's time for a change like Barack said<br/>
And I don't care<br/>
Hip-hop is not dead<br/>
Spit hot lead but none of these haters get shot dead<br/>
They don't bother me<br/>
I'll leave them playing for my wife<br/>
Kick back have a laugh while you complainin' 'bout your life<br/>
"Grrr" you hate Mac and you say you gonna fight?<br/>
It's all good bro, you entertainment for tonight<br/>
Like I'm a be mad?<br/>
You hatin' cause I'm white<br/>
Do a lot a cryin' and leave pain out on the mic<br/>
Because overall I'm iller than you all<br/>
Y'all pussy<br/>
Never ever gone for it all<br/>
You scared of a little risky coaching call<br/>
What happened?<br/>
I thought you were the know-it-all?<br/>
I stay smokin' while haze got a potent smell<br/>
It take me back to kickin' raps back in Show-And-Tell<br/>
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's people<br/>
How to come up like: "Yo, I know people"<br/>
Dead Presidents, this doe evil<br/>
So lethal the police will want to beat you<br/>
Sit you down then have you run your mouth<br/>
Bring your mother out: Look what your son is now<br/>
<i>[Laughs]</i><br/>
See my mom she know her son is well<br/>
The youngest child, she been through it for a while<br/>
Now I put 1 on the dial with a smile<br/>
Cause I'm wild, foul child style<br/>
Too focused on my grind don't ever catch an "f"<br/>
My hearts in it now even with five seconds left<br/>
I want the best won't settle for nothing less<br/>
And I always stay dressed in something fresh<br/>
So keep your head on strapped and show respect to the game<br/>
And that's what this beat messages my brain
