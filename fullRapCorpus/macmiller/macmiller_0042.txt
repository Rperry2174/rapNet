Uh<br/>
Look<br/>
Good Evening<br/>
Yeahhh<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
When I party in new york take the late night subway<br/>
Goin out friday they comin home monday<br/>
From all directions never find me on a one way flavor<br/>
The rhyme jus the icing on the cupcake fuck face<br/>
My fans notice these other rappers is bogus<br/>
I'm supercalifragalisticexpialidocious<br/>
And the boys stay kickin incredibly dope shit<br/>
Make my momma proud cause my clothes fit<br/>
Travel round the globe bitch on my louis clarke shit<br/>
Don't matter where I live cause I can tell you where my heart is<br/>
I jus stay on my side fuck where everybody at<br/>
Tell the planet peace cause I'm gone I ain't comin back<br/>
Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that<br/>
Tryin build a mil off a couple stacks on my own business<br/>
Investin all I got into these fuckin raps<br/>
Willy park the money hand it off n then it's runnin back<br/>
<br/>
Ayo you fuck with that, uh<br/>
You gotta fuck with that<br/>
You in love with dat, look<br/>
Uh, mac miller<br/>
<br/>
Takin sips from the fountain of youth<br/>
If you ain't heard about the kid then you outta the loop<br/>
As I'm sittin back starin at this world out in my eyes<br/>
See out the window in my room that I'm hidden inside<br/>
I'm just a kid who stays speakin his thoughts talkin his mind<br/>
Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride<br/>
Put my heart up on the page and the song in the crowd<br/>
It's large and behind the way you stayin caught in lie the boy<br/>
Ain't a shocker I'm a topic of discussion<br/>
Motherfucker want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't<br/>
They give a lil love like everyone does<br/>
In reality they stone off that competitive drug<br/>
And I don't blame em, cause those who above me I'm gunnin for<br/>
Tryin to make my way to the top startin from the floor<br/>
And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war<br/>
Cause I be on some shit they that they a'int ever done before<br/>
Takin over piece by piece, startin from the core<br/>
It's only been a year I could stick around a hundred<br/>
Said I could stick around hundred more<br/>
I a'int goin nowhere<br/>
<br/>
Young and some much time to go<br/>
Jerm you might as well keep this one rollin<br/>
I got like one more verse<br/>
I haven't spit three verses on a song in a minute<br/>
Ehum, see if I can remember this one verse<br/>
Aight look<br/>
<br/>
You can find me in the lab workin overtime<br/>
Smell the weed when you go on by<br/>
Global grind, I a'int just a local guy<br/>
When you're feelin stressed out, have it now<br/>
Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel<br/>
Live fast when I die better wish me well<br/>
Ha, I just they servin beer in hell<br/>
Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell<br/>
So please, stick around for the epilogue<br/>
For anyone who ever blogged, probably heard my name<br/>
Hip hops underdog he wanna win the game<br/>
I'm sick of hearin how music change, never been the same<br/>
And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane<br/>
Call yourself a vet but haven't won a single game<br/>
Mad every girl got my name imprinted in her brain<br/>
Boy I'm a beast, match the style in bars<br/>
Find me smokin weed where the wild things are, ha<br/>
<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
So I mean I had to take this time, real quickly<br/>
To just go in<br/>
I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin in on your shit<br/>
That's just me<br/>
I mean Q, Tree Jay out there we excited just makin history<br/>
And germ of course
