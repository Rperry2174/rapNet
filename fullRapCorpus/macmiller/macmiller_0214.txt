<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
What type of music should I make? It generates love and it generates hate<br/>
What kind of topics should I stress? I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex.<br/>
Talk about life or talk about death. Living care free or I can talk about stress<br/>
What kind of picture should I paint? What kind of music should I make?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
So many things to say not a lot of times that I can say em’<br/>
I can talk about the fact that I’m a rapping caucasian.<br/>
Talk about going to school and getting bad grades.<br/>
Talk about breaking the rules and having bad days.<br/>
I could talk about girl problems.<br/>
I could talk about hoes from the ugly to the hot ones.<br/>
Or I could talk abut this dream I have.<br/>
Or I could talk about my homies when I seem em’ last.<br/>
Say I’m the illest on the mic, how I kill it when I write.<br/>
Or how the lights when they film it so bright.<br/>
I could talk about the fame and the hoes.<br/>
Or all the name brands on my clothes.<br/>
Talk about the highs, talk about the lows.<br/>
Talk about the highs that you get when you smoke.<br/>
I talk about a lot of shit when I write.. because it’s part of my life.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
What type of music should I make? It generates love and it generates hate<br/>
What kind of topics should I stress? I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex.<br/>
Talk about life or talk about death. Living care free or I can talk about stress<br/>
What kind of picture should I paint? What kind of music should I make?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I could talk about the parties that I go to.<br/>
Talk about how it’s so different from the old school.<br/>
I could talk about the pop and the whack rap.<br/>
Or I could talk about some ounces in a backpack.<br/>
Talk about a fitted, talk about a snap back.<br/>
Something simple, or something real abstract.<br/>
About the war, talk about politics.<br/>
Or I could tell you how full my Louis wallet is.<br/>
I could talk about a few religions.<br/>
Or how to turn a Jew into a Christian.<br/>
I could talk about the shit that make you cry.<br/>
Or I could make it all up and just talk about lies.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
What type of music should I make? It generates love and it generates hate<br/>
What kind of topics should I stress? I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex.<br/>
Talk about life or talk about death. Living care free or I can talk about stress<br/>
What kind of picture should I paint? What kind of music should I make?
