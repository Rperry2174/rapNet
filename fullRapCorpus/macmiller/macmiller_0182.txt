Who's that on the other end of the phone<br/>
Didn't hear nothing when I said my hello<br/>
Oh well, to hell then we go<br/>
So high looking at heaven below<br/>
You know me though from coast to coast for smoking dope<br/>
Overdose with the holy ghost but hold the phones<br/>
I hold my own, was local grown<br/>
Been killing that shit since row the boat<br/>
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest<br/>
One more drank, I'mma be an alcoholic<br/>
I don't wanna think like better unconscious<br/>
Need fresh air that thing so toxic<br/>
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war<br/>
Told my mama you ain't need no drama<br/>
You ain't gotta cry no more<br/>
<br/>
It'll be alright<br/>
My mind on the run I won't sleep tonight it's like<br/>
When it all goes up in flames who gon hold me down<br/>
And I'm the chosen one<br/>
Looking all around what has the world become<br/>
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground<br/>
I've been getting paid<br/>
About four, five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain<br/>
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'mma drown<br/>
<br/>
You've never been better than me<br/>
From this prison I'm setting them free<br/>
Open eyes, I'mma let you see<br/>
This world is like our dreams<br/>
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday<br/>
I'm running to the edge<br/>
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump<br/>
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly<br/>
I wonder if I jump<br/>
Do you think that I can fly<br/>
<br/>
It's the life of an entertainer<br/>
I need that check go on get the waiter<br/>
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode<br/>
And these explosions don't need detonators<br/>
I met my maker in an elevator, he was headed to the top floor<br/>
We're quite similar, we just did our work and we were in it for a lot more<br/>
We were trying to change the world but we got bored<br/>
When I rip this show, got an encore<br/>
Back when we were still in school we didn't listen to the list of rules<br/>
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard<br/>
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles<br/>
I told my homies the top so lonely but<br/>
We're not gonna die not now<br/>
<br/>
You'll make it here, live free tonight till the day appear<br/>
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile<br/>
How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch<br/>
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now<br/>
Go on and on, know I had this shit all along<br/>
Take a breath, feel this moment hold it just so you can<br/>
Look where we at, look where we came from<br/>
When will we wake up, lost in translation<br/>
<br/>
You've never been better than me<br/>
From this prison I'm setting them free<br/>
Open eyes, I'mma let you see<br/>
This world is like our dreams<br/>
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday<br/>
I'm running to the edge<br/>
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump<br/>
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly<br/>
I wonder if I jump<br/>
Do you think that I can fly
