(Real shit, new shit)<br/>
Yeah I done been through it all<br/>
Every brick in the wall<br/>
Got a bitch I'mma call when I'm tryna fuck<br/>
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job<br/>
Cause you live in the mall - bills pile up<br/>
I'mma chill in the spot, with a spliff I been lifted a lot<br/>
But I'm still not high enough<br/>
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot<br/>
If there's a list to the top you could sign me up<br/>
Yeah, sign me up<br/>
Sign me up<br/>
Can't bring me down<br/>
Sign me up<br/>
Can't burn me up can't bring me up<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, above ground about thirty thousand miles up<br/>
Told the bitch slow down like dial-up<br/>
Go down first and she climbing up<br/>
Wanna let me cut, tell her "line it up"<br/>
Little bit much, I'm a wild one<br/>
All I do is fuck hoes, drink tiger blood<br/>
Ever since I came in the game they been sour<br/>
I'm the plug, get your motherfuckin' power up<br/>
Mind your business, you in my office<br/>
And I go get it, I need all it<br/>
I stay lifted, smoking, sipping<br/>
Fixes fixing all my problems<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I done been through it all<br/>
Every brick in the wall<br/>
Got a bitch I'mma call when I'm tryna fuck<br/>
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job<br/>
Cause you live in the mall - bills pile up<br/>
I'mma chill in the spot, with a spliff I been lifted a lot<br/>
But I'm still not high enough<br/>
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot<br/>
If there's a list to the top you could sign me up<br/>
Yeah, sign me up<br/>
Sign me up<br/>
Can't bring me down<br/>
Sign me up<br/>
Can't burn me up can't bring me up<br/>
<br/>
I was a nobody, now my name's on the list<br/>
Couple keys of uncut cocaine on the wrist<br/>
And I let my nuts hang on a bitch<br/>
The money that we spend on champagne is ridiculous<br/>
And it is us, elixir in my cup<br/>
Give the bitches drugs, a dick to suck<br/>
And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me<br/>
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth<br/>
Came for a steak but I left with the cow<br/>
And they hate when you right though<br/>
Ain't shit change but my checking account<br/>
Mac Milly<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I done been through it all<br/>
Every brick in the wall<br/>
Got a bitch I'mma call when I'm tryna fuck<br/>
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job<br/>
Cause you live in the mall - bills pile up<br/>
I'mma chill in the spot, with a spliff I been lifted a lot<br/>
But I'm still not high enough<br/>
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot<br/>
If there's a list to the top you could sign me up<br/>
Yeah, sign me up<br/>
Sign me up<br/>
Can't bring me down<br/>
Sign me up<br/>
Can't burn me up can't bring me up
