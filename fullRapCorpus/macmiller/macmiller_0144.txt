Yeah, yeah<br/>
Shoulda died already<br/>
I shoulda died already, shit<br/>
I shoulda died already<br/>
Came in, I was high already<br/>
Everybody trippin' and my mind ain't steady<br/>
From my sin, shoulda been crucified already<br/>
Why the fuck you need me?<br/>
Don't you know how to fly already?<br/>
Try and tell you that it ain't real<br/>
Tell 'em, find that Yeti<br/>
Oh, motherfucker!<br/>
And it all go down right now<br/>
I never been so ready<br/>
All my homies philosophers<br/>
Yea, all my homies philosophers<br/>
Now I don't need nobody, I would love somebody though<br/>
Don't you ever get it fucked up<br/>
Everybody wanna be God<br/>
Beside God, he wanna be like us<br/>
We never sleep too much, beat that pussy up<br/>
She gonna need that trust<br/>
Never see me on the street too much but<br/>
On the inside, I'm outside, all the time<br/>
Tryna stay away from that electric shock<br/>
That electric shock, I'm outside
