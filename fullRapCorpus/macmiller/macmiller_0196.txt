<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?<br/>
Coldest motherfucker in the room?<br/>
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?<br/>
Coldest motherfucker in the room?<br/>
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?<br/>
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?<br/>
Bring him ’round here he’s gettin’ froze<br/>
(He’s gettin’ froze, he’s gettin’ froze)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Roll it up, let’s smoke<br/>
And tell me why your bitch look like Glenn Close<br/>
I’m on my own two, that’s ten toes<br/>
First a rule of sly, somebody says go<br/>
Why you bent low when your Jordans’ retro<br/>
Girls playin’ games for the bills, they Drew Bledsoe<br/>
There’s a lot that you can buy, but I’ll never own<br/>
And a lot of information that I’ll never know<br/>
Learn ’til they get concerned for my sanity<br/>
Your life is filled with vanity, needs a little clarity<br/>
This the truth, this a taste, can you handle it?<br/>
A million dollars couldn’t cover up the damages<br/>
Naked girl at the crib makin’ sandwiches<br/>
And when we makin’ love I got a candle lit<br/>
Some romantic shit to put her in the mood<br/>
The world woke me up, now I’m lookin’ at the snooze<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Curren$y]</i><br/>
Life, look at my hands I’m the lord of the rings<br/>
Musical cocaine brought me all of these Carrera keys<br/>
Soft top goin’ hard on the block freeze that talk<br/>
And that plot about walkin’ up on me<br/>
No security just my homies, the well dressed army<br/>
Presidential arm piece, my credentials I’m a G<br/>
All access jets wherever you won’t be<br/>
Snatch that ‘vette for my mans the day of his prison release<br/>
Shoe was on the other foot I know he would’ve done the same thing for me<br/>
But we’ll let that be<br/>
Park it in the spot right next to my b with the chrome wings<br/>
I was sent here to own things<br/>
Both sides of the court, colder than the airport<br/>
Therefore I’m the one that holds hair for, yeah what<br/>
<br/>
