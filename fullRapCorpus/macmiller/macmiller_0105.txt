<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Ol’ ratchet ass bitch<br/>
(Fuck me) tryna get your hustle on<br/>
Ain’t no nigga gunna pay your muthafuckin’ bills, bitch<br/>
Get your own shit, I don’t give a fuck, ho<br/>
Mac Miller, tell these hoes what’s up, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
She sayin’ fuck me, fuck me, she like it rough and that’s rugby<br/>
I’m partyin’ where there’s drugs free, this life to live, it don’t come cheap<br/>
Leave a hand print on her butt cheek, she give me head while I puff trees<br/>
I’m on drugs, she on drugs, her nose just got bloody<br/>
Sniffin’ coke lines off my dick, she ridin’ on that train<br/>
She crushin’ down that powder, I’m puffin’ on this Sour<br/>
Been fuckin’ her for hours and I still ain’t got my nut<br/>
You fuckin’ with that molly, she ain’t gon’ let you bust<br/>
Give me some while I hit the blunt, I’m in ya spirit, let me lift it up<br/>
If daddy come, get my shit and run, he gon’ see my ass, go and get his gun<br/>
You a devil bitch, let me tell you that, feel like I been to hell and back<br/>
You textin’ me, addicted, you need me, you miss it<br/>
She crazy, she nasty, everyday she harass me<br/>
I’m fuckin’ her to sleep and then she pay for my taxi<br/>
God damn, the sun is comin’ up<br/>
That’s the last time that I’m gon’ be fuckin’ with them drugs<br/>
Yup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
She get a bunch of money, spend it all on drugs<br/>
Mobbin’ with her bitches, never fall in love<br/>
Dumpin’ out that yayo, sniffin’ all it up<br/>
Go ahead and hate her, cause everybody does<br/>
<br/>
God damn, that’s a lucky ass bitch <i>[X4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
She got money, drugs and freedom, blunts what she’s cheefin’<br/>
She ain’t got a job, but fuck it, she don’t need one<br/>
Drive drunk, she swervin’, tryna fuck, she’s certain<br/>
Run around and stumble down, hit her head, she hurtin’<br/>
Drunk as fuck, sniffin’ pills, wildin’ out, tell the bitch to chill<br/>
Cup of syrup and a blunt of purp<br/>
Which one of my homie’s gon’ fuck her first?<br/>
She in love with drugs, that pussy get licked up<br/>
Picked up, then dicked down, bitch, tell me who rich now?<br/>
You fuckin’ with the Most Dope knuckleheads<br/>
Gettin’ money, fuck the feds, yeah that Stevie Wonder bread<br/>
Ain’t a rookie, uh, that bitch is famous, Snookie<br/>
One thing I won’t do, (what’s that?) pay for pussy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I’m trippy mane, looking for a trippy chick<br/>
That like to get fucked up and do some trippy shit<br/>
Paper planes rolled up I call them trippy sticks<br/>
Weed, pills, and the drank (codeine)– she with it<br/>
Juicy got money and juicy got bitches<br/>
Smoking and drinking that Charlie Sheen living<br/>
Up in this bitch keep two hoes with me<br/>
Poppin’ them superman pills getting freaky (they freaky)<br/>
I like double D’s, she like double D’s<br/>
Shawty can’t lose, she play on both teams<br/>
Hell in her mouth, her becky fire<br/>
Molly pills, orange juice got the bitch wired<br/>
All my hoes got money and they keep me higher<br/>
Then I line em’ up for a menage-a-tois-er<br/>
<br/>
