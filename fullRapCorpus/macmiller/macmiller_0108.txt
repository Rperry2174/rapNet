<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Uhh, this that motherfuckin' millionaire music you feel me?<br/>
Cheuh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
You can't believe it, it's ridiculous, belligerent<br/>
Oh my bad I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit<br/>
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch<br/>
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, that's ignorant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, so I just bought another Rolie and that shit is Goldie Hawn<br/>
Better get it before it's gone because my shop been open long<br/>
I stay smokin' on that strong, I'm smokin' on that strong<br/>
Then go and take a hand full of drugs what the fuck is goin' on?<br/>
Bein' rich, well, thats fun as hell<br/>
These bitches come like they under spells<br/>
Yo Mr. Jobs you see I'm a Mac, but I'm rollin' deep like Adele<br/>
I'm Robert Downey Jr., you more like Steve Carell<br/>
So get smart, no head starts, put a Lion on a Gazelle<br/>
You tryna to rhyme because you idolize but I design for myself<br/>
But it's hard to find these bars of mine, so Columbine your self<br/>
I don't hate ya bitch, just fakin' rich, I get paper like RJ Camberidge<br/>
I'm best friends with my banker shit, gave her fifty racks just to make a wish<br/>
Brand new crib I'm paintin' it, half a mil just paid for it<br/>
No thanksgiving paradin' it, but we marchin' like the Saint's came in<br/>
So run and hide, eyes open wide because this will be your jam<br/>
Just burn a dutch and turn it up as I pass it off to Cam (damn!)<br/>
<br/>
I got that Mac with me (huh... huh)<br/>
I got that Mac with me (huh... huh)<br/>
I got that Mac with me (huh... huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
You can't believe it, it's ridiculous, belligerent<br/>
Oh my bad I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit<br/>
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch<br/>
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, that's ignorant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Cam'ron]</i><br/>
I got that Mac with me<br/>
Yo, we never met before but there will be a mess for sure<br/>
When I was a baby my crib, was Mom's dresser drawer<br/>
Infared, blastin' guns, duckin' shots, another K, another tank<br/>
Another Glock, they smokin' weed, shipping E, crushin' rocks<br/>
Forget the Porsche they want your baby mother's box<br/>
And you pamper honey, word he pamper honey<br/>
And she sucking d! ck for formula and Pamper money<br/>
And a real thug don't play that, laid back where the mac and the K at<br/>
Yayo turned to the straight crack, Maybach black with a gat won't say jack, say jack, say jack...<br/>
<br/>
I got that Mac with me (huh... huh)<br/>
I got that Mac with me (huh... huh)<br/>
I got that Mac with me (huh... huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You can't believe it, it's ridiculous, belligerent<br/>
Oh my bad I'm just killin' shit, I'm killin' shit<br/>
A girl a girl, a bitch a bitch, a bitch a bitch<br/>
Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, that's ignorant<br/>
<br/>
I got that Mac with me
