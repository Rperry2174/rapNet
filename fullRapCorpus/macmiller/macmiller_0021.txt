Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death<br/>
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress<br/>
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest<br/>
It's (5 o'clock in the mornin')<br/>
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death<br/>
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress<br/>
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest<br/>
<br/>
The streets empty 'round 5 o'clock<br/>
Driving by the cops<br/>
Low key microscopic 'till the eyes that watch<br/>
Everything a hustle when you tryin' come buy some guap<br/>
I'm a keep grindin' 'till I'm still shining like a diamond watch<br/>
Me and boo here bringing you the truth<br/>
With all night sessions we just living in the booth<br/>
Strong balls like we spitting out 150 proof<br/>
Take shots get loose 'till you spitting up yo' food (like ohh)<br/>
You see 'dat I'm a need a recap<br/>
Grab a weed sack cheap that 'till my feet flat<br/>
I got this covered like a pro bowl d-back<br/>
Breathe rap been a been known to make the b-clip<br/>
Need cash so I'm tryin' to move some trees fast<br/>
Tell you where to meet at<br/>
Ask you where the cheese at<br/>
People 'round the city see the youngin' and respect the grind<br/>
Puttin' in th extra time<br/>
Guaranteed next to shine<br/>
<br/>
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death<br/>
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress<br/>
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest<br/>
It's (5 o'clock in the mornin')<br/>
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death<br/>
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress<br/>
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Boaz:]</i><br/>
I rise before the sun come up and get my day started<br/>
Pray to the most how I roll up my hays and spark it<br/>
And then my paper starts to roll in<br/>
Money in paper bags<br/>
Hammers with laser tags<br/>
We grown men<br/>
Out on the corner 'till the early morn'<br/>
The blood of a hustla gettin' mines before I was born<br/>
You get stormed by these tight ass bars<br/>
From being easy Mac<br/>
Crusin' in lax smokin' weed with no season at<br/>
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (why?)<br/>
Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us<br/>
They get the BBS's radios play us<br/>
Then we blaze in the Benz's<br/>
And sit this off on BBS's<br/>
And from P.A to Texas<br/>
These niggas know about me<br/>
International hustla can't get no snow without me<br/>
Or get no dough without me<br/>
Niggas gettin' hardly stackin' on 'er<br/>
Early bird get the worm<br/>
I'm knockin' at the cracker dome<br/>
<br/>
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death<br/>
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress<br/>
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest<br/>
It's (5 o'clock in the mornin')<br/>
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death<br/>
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress<br/>
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest
