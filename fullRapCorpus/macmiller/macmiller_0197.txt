<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
The definition of cool, thats me yo<br/>
Ask ya girl about me, bet she know<br/>
I’m the future, you a fake bitch, cleo<br/>
All my bitches bad like it’s Shaq shooting free throws<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey ayo, my first name Mac, my last name Miller<br/>
On beats I’m a monster, I’m iller than Godzilla<br/>
Yeah my skin Vanilla, I’m hotter than Chinchillas<br/>
Hittin’ Vegas for the night and cop a villa<br/>
Get my lyrics from ill and my soul from J Dilla<br/>
Chillin’ with the sour cause some smoke will kill ya<br/>
I’m just me, tryna cover all these magazines<br/>
And bitches try to give me treats like its Halloween<br/>
Lil’ old school flavour when its Jerm on the drums<br/>
Dodge the bullet points like it’s words from a gun<br/>
Spittin’ flames so they burn in my tongue<br/>
Bitches wanna fuck but they heard that I’m young<br/>
And they still do, I’mma stick around call me Mildew<br/>
Go and stay in Bel Air like uncle Phil do<br/>
Get rich go and buy me a mansion<br/>
Get my parents a nice crib up in the Hampton’s<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Diggy - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Shots at a general, roll like an inner tube<br/>
Drinking on tigers blood, that’s what winners do<br/>
It seems as if you’d like to hang from my genitals<br/>
Whoa, pause, oh, gosh<br/>
It is I, the D to the I<br/>
With the two G’s like it’s Gucci attire<br/>
Why, don’t ask why, you’re so inquisitive<br/>
And these shoes I’m wearing are only limited<br/>
My bad, was that a bit much, a tad<br/>
Didn’t mean to brag, that was low class<br/>
Pardon my rudeness that was so crass<br/>
And I’m always making moves, cause I never procras-tinate<br/>
The number one spot is up for grabs – too late<br/>
What was that question you asked<br/>
What’s the definition of CO-OL<br/>
If you haven’t gotten it by now, oh well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller]</i><br/>
You ain't cooler than me, go get a job bitch<br/>
You ain't cooler than me, go get a job bitch<br/>
You ain't cooler than me, empty pockets<br/>
You ain't cooler than, you ain’t, you ain’t cooler than me<br/>
Little asshole got you so mad<br/>
Make ‘em say ughhhhh
