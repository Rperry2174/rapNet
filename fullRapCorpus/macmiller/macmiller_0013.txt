2 records hard to find, so I thought I'd start this rhyme witha couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind.<br/>
I've had all the dimes and all are fine but now I need the one to call her mine.<br/>
Ya know that girl that everybody wants but can't have fat ass, nice ass, high class.<br/>
I get the last laugh now cause she under my arm, Lay down hittin' L lookin' up at the stars.<br/>
<br/>
I tell her listen I ain't gonna do you wrong, forget what you hearin' on my songs.<br/>
My always is gone I'm a be real with ya.<br/>
Recently I've been lookin' at the big picture.<br/>
Perfectly framed see the way I'm workin' the game,<br/>
Take my name I'm a share all my fortune and fame.<br/>
Beauty or brains, girl you all the above.<br/>
True player for real, But now I'm fallin' in love.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm bout to get high with my lady <i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
You used to the bullshit the dudes put you through it,<br/>
Cupid never shot up such a nuisence see with me my love is with the music,<br/>
But baby you can be the next to it, my boys say I'm stupid I need to move along.<br/>
And when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right.<br/>
My moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her, and the fellas say I could deal without her.<br/>
See baby I ain't playin' around I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground cause that's real, real.<br/>
Just had to tell you how I feel, and the party tonights goin' crazy, but I'm just here with my baby.<br/>
I love the way that she makes me, I'm a just gonna kick it with her and break tree's.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm bout to get high with my lady <i>[x6]</i>
