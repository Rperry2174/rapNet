<i>[Verse 1: Delusional Thomas]</i><br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
What happens when I'm suicidal, vibrations up through my spinal<br/>
From the hits to the vinyl, my mind will be in the bible<br/>
I will see the signs and I'll probably not understand a lot<br/>
Rode around town yesterday, straight from camelot<br/>
The prayers are not in common language, they don't mean a thing<br/>
The evil king of underworlds accumulating bodies<br/>
This rap shit is turning into nothing but a hobby<br/>
Cuase' the pussy has already been fucked or in the lobby waiting<br/>
Dominating the matrix kick it with God and Satan<br/>
Isolation through my veins, Into these constellations<br/>
Drug users, they won't let us join the club<br/>
So now it's spanish bitch massage, give my joints a rub<br/>
What's the purpose of everything, Who the fuck cares?<br/>
We run scared, cause nothing fair and we don't become aware<br/>
Pretend it don't exist, ignorance, the only bliss<br/>
I think it's me, well I hope it is<br/>
But no kids and no responsibilities, I'm writing soliloquies<br/>
And transcend visually, the intelligent idiots who never be serious<br/>
Cause the world around is fucked up, so we'd rather get fucked up<br/>
(My grandpa used to carry a flask)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
As I'm pacing back and forth, waiting till they pass the torch<br/>
Life a bitch, about forty and a sad divorce, Voice is hoarse<br/>
Getting harder to speak, remarkable themes<br/>
Talk mark to the beast<br/>
I saw them caught on the leash, we walk in common asleep<br/>
And coffins talking to Steven Hawking, even we see it often<br/>
So we close our eyes, hoping we forgot to die<br/>
Shit it must have slipped my mind, why<br/>
Well, I haven't seen a genuine smile in awhile<br/>
Mostly everybody stuck in denial<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]</i><br/>
So I'm coming out of cryogenics just to taste the air<br/>
You ain't aware... I'm talking about Natalie the cattle eater<br/>
With nasty features<br/>
Rapping with a flaccid wiener (shit), that's only half a Peter<br/>
Taking out the dogs, murder half a PITA<br/>
(No, no humus with that)<br/>
Yeah, look, having conversations with myself, getting into arguments<br/>
When I'm out in London, I be posted at the parliament<br/>
Coke in the parliaments, chilling by some monuments<br/>
Ominous when I feel your body with godly hollow tips<br/>
Leave you holy, prepare for the apocalypse<br/>
Sixty thousand on a rollie, cookies with the chocolate chips<br/>
Rapping hippopotamus, mother fuck a zookeeper<br/>
I don't do features, I snort glue and shoot ether<br/>
Hand full of sleeping pills, It's only me I kill<br/>
I'm Jack, wanna sleep with Jill, she'd spill on my penis drill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Mr. Jesus can you save my life (yeah, yeah)<br/>
Looking at a mans casket (turn him into ham salad)<br/>
How I'm feeling fantastic (the finish line, I ran past it]</div>]
