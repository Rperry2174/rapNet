<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes<br/>
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Aye lace em up, Lace em up, Lace em up, &amp; Lace em<br/>
Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon.<br/>
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete,<br/>
Uh I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night.<br/>
Revis take me shoppin when I'm up in New York<br/>
Hit the shoe store go &amp; cop a few more<br/>
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court<br/>
I'm at LA eatin 22 course<br/>
Young boss bitch paper in my pockets<br/>
I got a closet filled with shoe boxes<br/>
Mom says my spending habit a little bit obnoxious<br/>
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit<br/>
Used to rock hand me downs<br/>
Now I buy some clothes wear em out, hit the club bitches pull they cameras out.<br/>
Livin in a dream they beginning to believe<br/>
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed.<br/>
Shit, with what I'm spitting they should give me a degree<br/>
Good liqour what I'm sipping isn't cheap uh<br/>
Feeling a blow don't snooze don't sleep<br/>
All I really need is some shoes on my feet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes<br/>
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes<br/>
Nike nike nikes<br/>
Nike nike nikes<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I make em so mad, they got no swag<br/>
Pimpins on my feet they the throw backs<br/>
Look, my moneys good but these hoes bad<br/>
So they stay attached to my gonads uh<br/>
Wakin up to a few L's<br/>
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell<br/>
I guess I'm going well<br/>
Smoking all the weed that I used to sell<br/>
But once my album goes in the shelves<br/>
It's goin Nextel how it's feelin sell<br/>
For now we sellin tapes out my shoe box<br/>
Any spot just set up my shop<br/>
Ya mad that ya girl always says that I'm hot<br/>
Shes buyin my t-shirt but shes spending your guap<br/>
Say whud up if you see me around<br/>
Nike airs separate my feet from the ground it's just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes<br/>
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes<br/>
Nike nike nikes<br/>
Nike nike nikes<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes<br/>
Nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nike nikes
