<i>[Mac Miller &amp; Domo Genesis:]</i><br/>
Driving in my car, Sunday afternoon, chillin'<br/>
Who is coming up to my car? What?<br/>
I know niggas think you white and you not bout to go in with these bars, my nigga, but that is not the truth.<br/>
Word to God I take another shot of Hennessy if you don't go in right now and meet your fate right now, bruh<br/>
What the fu...<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay<br/>
Yeah, the hustle continues, man<br/>
Okay, okay<br/>
(You's a wild motherfucker, Mac)<br/>
<br/>
So this the music that made white people mad<br/>
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out<br/>
This the shit you dream about<br/>
You can know the world is up for grabs<br/>
Leave with everything cause everything is in the bag<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger, I was just a little wild motherfucker<br/>
Tryna be like all the people on television<br/>
They had all the bitches that I wanted, all the cars and all the extras<br/>
Anything money could buy, they was spending millions<br/>
I was tryna get to pimping, I was tryna blow up talking demolition<br/>
That boy got the devil in him, swear he need an exorcism<br/>
I'm all by myself, got no competition<br/>
Keep it real in a world that's filled with politicians<br/>
You want to talk about your problems<br/>
Don't you wish the life you lived was motherfucking awesome<br/>
Don't you wish you had all the pussy, too much money you could spend<br/>
You could get away and never see your shitty life again<br/>
<br/>
So this the music that made white people mad<br/>
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out<br/>
This the shit you dream about<br/>
You can know the world is up for grabs<br/>
Leave with everything cause everything is in the bag<br/>
<br/>
We never done with this shit<br/>
Here we come with that shit<br/>
I ain't stressing, I ain't worried bout nothing, don't trip<br/>
It's amazing all the shit that I be coming up with<br/>
Shit is real, tell 'em chill<br/>
Keep on bumping my shit<br/>
<br/>
All my life I been a fuck up, never did anything right<br/>
That's why everyday I'm fucked up<br/>
Momma pray to Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)<br/>
Asking somebody to save me (Somebody save that boy)<br/>
But I'm way too motherfucking crazy (No one can save that boy)<br/>
All the kids is doing drugs (Drugs)<br/>
They just want to break the law and find someone to fuck<br/>
(They wanna find someone to fuck)<br/>
Nobody doing as they told (Little bad ass kids)<br/>
Everyone out of control (Fuck it, that's just how it is)<br/>
I'm self made, dream came true, I'm a miracle<br/>
Every time I put my dick inside a bitch, itâ€™s spiritual<br/>
Got the whip that say wealthy on my steering wheel<br/>
Brand new model bitch made me waffles and some cereal<br/>
That's what I call a good morning<br/>
Your mom work an extra job just to get you Jordans<br/>
Just so you could show up at your school looking fresh saying<br/>
"I don't know 'bout you, but me, I'm important" (I'm so gorgeous)<br/>
You got money in your pocket, you the shit<br/>
You got everything you want and bitches on your dick<br/>
Yeah, a couple grand got you feeling like the man<br/>
Everybody walking tall til they trip<br/>
They just cut the check, you had to go and cop the whip<br/>
Drive up to your ex's crib and tell her she ain't shit<br/>
There's just something about the money, make a motherfucker crazy<br/>
When I die, bury me in my Mercedes, God damn<br/>
<br/>
So this the music that made white people mad<br/>
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out<br/>
This the shit you dream about<br/>
You can know the world is up for grabs<br/>
Leave with everything cause everything is in the bag<br/>
<br/>
We never done with this shit<br/>
Here we come with that shit<br/>
I ain't stressing, I ain't worried bout nothing, don't trip<br/>
It's amazing all the shit that I be coming up with<br/>
Shit is real, tell 'em chill<br/>
Keep on bumping my shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller &amp; ScHoolboy Q:]</i><br/>
Bumping my shit<br/>
Bumping my shit<br/>
Bumping my shit<br/>
Bumping my shit
