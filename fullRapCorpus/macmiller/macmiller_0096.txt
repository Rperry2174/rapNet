<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool<br/>
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about<br/>
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy<br/>
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial<br/>
If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now<br/>
And to the man in the hat standing lookin' at his watch<br/>
Motherfucker, well the time is now<br/>
Go clap your hands, let me hear you say that's the jam<br/>
See I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans<br/>
Can't sit down kids you have to stand<br/>
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance<br/>
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan<br/>
Iraq, Iran, and have them sayin' Mac's the man<br/>
The maximum, coming through to pass you bums<br/>
So if you ain't got no money better ask for some<br/>
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time<br/>
Bring the champagne out and the good wine<br/>
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips<br/>
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis<br/>
Comin' in the back door yellin' fuck a list<br/>
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss<br/>
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit<br/>
Now sing this part, it goes like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
All my people in the front<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
Everybody in the back<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
If you're feeling that funk<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
If you love it like that<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
Go and clap your hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
H-h-h-h-hold up<br/>
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up<br/>
I show up cause fans will go nuts<br/>
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch<br/>
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush<br/>
Cause girl, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss<br/>
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that<br/>
Keep it goin' I'm a bring it all back<br/>
H-h-h-h-hold up<br/>
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up<br/>
I show up cause fans will go nuts<br/>
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch<br/>
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush<br/>
Baby, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss<br/>
I hear these couples fighting all the time, not us<br/>
We have a good time, like to get fucked up<br/>
What, what, goin' hard tonight<br/>
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight<br/>
Hey, driving round in my car tonight<br/>
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write<br/>
A couple bars I might go do<br/>
Something crazy or maybe lazy, love me or hate me<br/>
You know it's the same me<br/>
And it goes a little something like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool<br/>
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about<br/>
I heard your mans ran crying to his mommy and his daddy<br/>
When the cops drove by his house<br/>
So who you tryin' to dial<br/>
If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now<br/>
And to the man in the hat standing looking at his watch<br/>
Motherfucker, well the time is now
