<i>[Bun B:]</i><br/>
The people think it's all about the fame<br/>
And the money and the status and the game<br/>
But it's deeper than all that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
They just want the women and the cars<br/>
Getting high so they can chill with some stars<br/>
But it's deeper than all that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B:]</i><br/>
They thinking that it's all about the shows<br/>
And the chains hanging down on your clothes<br/>
But it's deeper than all that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
We're here to change the world with this thing called rap<br/>
Homie, believe me, it's all that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Bun B]</i><br/>
I got that money on my mind, the grind<br/>
And the ability, the knowledge and the know-how<br/>
Stamina and agility<br/>
Soon as I step in the facility these haters start<br/>
Testing my civility, I'm telling you<br/>
They killing me. some of them feeling me<br/>
And some of them be grilling me but<br/>
I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceiling g<br/>
Yeah, and take a toke of the swisher smoke<br/>
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc<br/>
What is an emcee if he can't rap?<br/>
Just a monkey with a mic just waiting to get slapped<br/>
What is a dj if he can't scratch?<br/>
The one rotten apple that's spoling the whole bag<br/>
What is a b-boy if he can't break?<br/>
Might as well do the dougie or even the harlem shake<br/>
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?<br/>
No homophobia, but he's a fag<br/>
Cause it's deeper than all that...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
One time for the world cause we do it for y'all<br/>
That logo light up in the sky when the studio call<br/>
Moving the crowd, get em loud without a gimmick<br/>
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whipping it up in minutes<br/>
My feet up in this game<br/>
Rapping even made a divot<br/>
Don't worry about the critics<br/>
If it's happening now, forget it<br/>
For my heart is where I give it<br/>
Stay thinking about the future<br/>
When I'm rich, I'm a call my mom before I call the movers<br/>
These haters are just losers<br/>
Hate to see you winning<br/>
Gave my? the beginning<br/>
I'm in it for extra innings<br/>
Here to change the world like a change clothes<br/>
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos<br/>
But I"m right here for way more<br/>
What is somebody if they can't love?<br/>
A hater... someone give em a hug<br/>
We here to change the world with this thing called rap<br/>
And homie, believing is all that...
