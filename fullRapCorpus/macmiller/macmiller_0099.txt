<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Uh, Chya, Uh, Uh<br/>
Dedicated too, this dedicated too<br/>
Fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Uh, I got a pocket full of posies<br/>
Some devil with a pitchfork keep talkin' like he know me<br/>
I'm psychopathic, low key, my hyperactive dome piece<br/>
Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak<br/>
I stood before an Angel as he told me bout the glory<br/>
Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely<br/>
I only get money, these labels tryna clone me<br/>
Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete<br/>
So, I try to keep em' in my head<br/>
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead<br/>
Word to heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass<br/>
Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last<br/>
A bunch of tracks, you see this mic is like my punchin' bag<br/>
Rock n' Roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath<br/>
Sucker ass motherfucker, motherfuckers venom and<br/>
Doper than the shit that put Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents<br/>
Desert rhymes, homie, ridin' beats, I'm on a camel<br/>
I'm way too hot to handle, life a beach, I brought my sandals<br/>
Haha, you want a war, I got a lot of ammo<br/>
You ain't a soldier cause you rockin' cammo<br/>
Young Rambo, hundred million fans though<br/>
And I do it big, you a iPod Nano<br/>
Fire on wax, look like I rock candles<br/>
Yeah you got a show, but you ain't on my channel<br/>
<br/>
That's HBO bitch, you gotta pay for that<br/>
Hahaha, your channels free<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you<br/>
<br/>
Um, Imax'n shit motherfucker<br/>
Yeah, suck my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, ayo, I'm bout to start gambilin' with Ambien<br/>
I'm dutch smokin', that's a strike<br/>
But fuck bowlin', I could tear a pin of Maryland<br/>
See, I'm American, apparently it's damagin'<br/>
To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn<br/>
Monroe, look at dumb hoes who want too much dough<br/>
And come close to having you straight trippin' when you jump rope<br/>
<br/>
Don't rock the love boat, this business fuckin' cut throat<br/>
And it's gonna crack is you just paint the wall with one coat<br/>
Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog<br/>
These rappers who be hatin' probably need to get a job<br/>
See me, I'm with my squad, gettin' money living comfortable<br/>
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though<br/>
Fuck a toast, y'all is fuckin' broke, cut ya throat<br/>
Judgin' me is nothin' dope, boy you lyin' under oath<br/>
God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?<br/>
And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?<br/>
I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture<br/>
Of the one Lawrence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters<br/>
I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold<br/>
If my skin gets filled up, I'm a tat my soul<br/>
Runnin' out of paper, writin' on my hand<br/>
Hundred thousand haters writin' bout my jams<br/>
Want a number one independent album? I'm your man<br/>
I'm a hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand
