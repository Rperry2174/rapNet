Ayo.. Yo what up Jerm<br/>
Beats crazy Bout to get my drink on<br/>
Go to one of them high school parties you know what I'm sayin? Chyeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Ayo if you got a cup put it up in the air<br/>
And if you smokin' on a blunt better puff it and share<br/>
You don't know you wake up not rememberin' last night<br/>
That shorty with the ass like the bottom of a bagpipe<br/>
Girl sucked my dick like she was swallowin' a mag light<br/>
Gotta get my cash right livin' in this fast life<br/>
I'm fucked up the room is spinnin' the ceiling is gone<br/>
I'm spittin' game on a girl but I'm feelin' her mom<br/>
I'm sippin' Crysie gettin' pissy while killin' in pong<br/>
I'm runnin' tables while my peoples are twistin' some bomb<br/>
Listen it's on I'm the man of the night<br/>
I shine bright can you handle the light?<br/>
They can't stand that I'm white<br/>
With a ego find me like Nemo<br/>
Chillin' with the homies and you know we let the trees blow<br/>
Y'all ain't makin' one point like a free throw<br/>
Haha yeah.. and the beat go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around like it was musical chairs<br/>
Get ya ass off your seat find yourself a new chair<br/>
<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around like it was musical chairs<br/>
Get ya ass off your seat find yourself a new chair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Party hard mu'fucker party hard<br/>
Have a ball laugh a little harty har<br/>
You hardly saw shit but now I'm all up in your face<br/>
With mixtape money boy no wallet is a waste<br/>
With a rubberband dutch with a dozen grams<br/>
Smokin' til I'm off my head<br/>
Now everybody do the runnin' man<br/>
We takin' it back it's easy boy<br/>
I'm all three members of the Beastie Boys<br/>
So fight for the right to party<br/>
Everybody stand up like Steve Harvey<br/>
I got surfers like "Damn he's gnarly"<br/>
And mother's givin' me a free bowl of beef barley<br/>
Ridin' in the back back<br/>
Back on the carseat<br/>
Gettin' out then park it in the car keys<br/>
Youngin' I'm reckless with blunts with my breakfast<br/>
And I'm rockin' more dunts and goin' at kids<br/>
Yes it's Mac.. Mac.. Mac.. Mac..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around like it was musical chairs<br/>
Get ya ass off your seat find yourself a new chair<br/>
<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around like it was musical chairs<br/>
Get ya ass off your seat find yourself a new chair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And I'ma get my diploma<br/>
You need to notice I'm a scholar<br/>
Runnin' through the streets ever since I was a toddler<br/>
Playin' cops and robbers<br/>
Always was a robber<br/>
In my neighborhood all day like Mr. Rogers<br/>
Now a little taller, hip hop monster<br/>
Eight-legged flow you can call me Peter Parker<br/>
I know you see it boy I'm weeded and spittin' it real<br/>
To match my style kid you best be equipped with some steel<br/>
My swagger mean dress fresh and so clean<br/>
In a flash getting change like a vending machine<br/>
Then I'm out pocket of piff hop in the whip<br/>
Head to the first dip at the top of the list<br/>
Roll in easy got you drinks for the free<br/>
On lean and my eyes still chink from the tree<br/>
Hoes out the playpen<br/>
Eyes behind some Rayban's<br/>
It's mayhem livin' in this teenage wasteland<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around like it was musical chairs<br/>
Get ya ass off your seat find yourself a new chair<br/>
<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around like it was musical chairs<br/>
Get ya ass off your seat find yourself a new chair<br/>
<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around<br/>
And move around<br/>
<br/>
Get get get get<br/>
<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
Get down get up<br/>
And move around like it was musical chairs<br/>
Get ya ass off your seat find yourself a new chair
