Ridin' with the windows down <br/>
Rollin through the city<br/>
Got the weed goin round<br/>
With the most dope with me<br/>
Simply gettin high like its 1969<br/>
Imma be grindin till the deal a hundred sixty<br/>
New york, atlanta too <br/>
Flyer then santa shoes<br/>
She bring her camera through<br/>
And I'm playin crash bandacoot<br/>
This beat a bitch got some cock to server<br/>
I'm a rape the game, no wrap this burger<br/>
Hey! above the clouds, seein stars like L.A<br/>
Have your girl always comin back like airway<br/>
Imma' be rich that's what they tell me<br/>
So let me start workin' with this paper like a essay<br/>
Hey, athleticism workin game when I'm gettin' women<br/>
The freshest linen like I'm spittin through your television<br/>
In a day dream livin' while these minutes pass me by<br/>
Lean back and hang ya nikes out the ride<br/>
The windows down, turn the system up<br/>
<br/>
We just tryna ride around cause we don't give a fuck<br/>
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke<br/>
Hey! lets just hit the road<br/>
<i>[X2]</i><br/>
Rockin khakicalo jeans and the plain white tee<br/>
Nike watch pouch chain, spend a day like me<br/>
Hey, everyday like a movie scene<br/>
Smokin weed, eyes glued to the computer screen<br/>
Uh, super duper skeet ridin in the civic<br/>
Just got some speakers now I'm tryna get it tinted<br/>
Every dream vivid, talk it how I live it<br/>
Up in the airplane playin quidditch, bitches<br/>
This is once of a lifetime they gonna put me in a flight no price line<br/>
Used to want to be a model fightin crime<br/>
Till i realized the boy had the nicest rhymes<br/>
<br/>
We just tryna ride around cause we don't give a fuck<br/>
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke<br/>
Hey! lets just hit the road<br/>
<i>[X2]</i>
