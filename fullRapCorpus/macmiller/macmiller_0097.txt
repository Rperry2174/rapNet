<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Everybody wanna ask where I came from<br/>
Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'm a make some<br/>
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one<br/>
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come<br/>
A million people in the world, I don't hate one<br/>
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns<br/>
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard<br/>
And you don't ever figure what you don't want at first<br/>
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts<br/>
100 words coming up with what'll have your bubble burst<br/>
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first<br/>
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first<br/>
I used to try everything with her, and nothin' worked<br/>
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first<br/>
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid<br/>
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is<br/>
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences<br/>
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this<br/>
You just entered into Blue Slide Park<br/>
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart<br/>
Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard<br/>
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark<br/>
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars<br/>
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars<br/>
That just sit in park cause I'm out somewhere travelin'<br/>
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'<br/>
Mad cause been known to always spaz again<br/>
Every single track with him, Oh he's just so talented<br/>
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses<br/>
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with<br/>
I observe, asking what did he design<br/>
I see an artificial future for a digital mind<br/>
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime<br/>
Just that normal kid in class who was sittin' behind<br/>
Didn't really pay attention though I'm spittin' his rhymes<br/>
But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside<br/>
No. Hell no<br/>
I wanna go back home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Late night can't remember what the day's like<br/>
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights<br/>
Cause it seems that I'm always on the move<br/>
When they gonna let me back home<br/>
I wanna go back home<br/>
I wanna go back home
