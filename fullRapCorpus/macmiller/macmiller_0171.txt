Woah-oh<br/>
(Hey!)<br/>
Wow-wow-wow-wow<br/>
(Hello)<br/>
Wow-wow-wow<br/>

Wow-wow<br/>
Woah-oh<br/>

<br/>
I made a promise to my momma<br/>
That I'll bless her with some grandkids, she can spoil them<br/>
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta<br/>
Can a man live? And it's all day (homie)<br/>
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get them all paid<br/>
Came a long way from all-state, yeah<br/>
Now we All-American, we All-American<br/>
<br/>
I swear to God I put the hero in Heroin<br/>
These flows, kilos<br/>
I could sell snow to a ski slope<br/>
I could sell evil to the devil<br/>
Nonbelievers to a temple<br/>
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat<br/>
And these eyes is iconic<br/>
I went pro, made profit<br/>
Now I keep some dead face in my pocket<br/>
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week<br/>
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G<br/>
Breezing my weed, easing my mind<br/>
Why you worry about me?<br/>
Stop tripping, I'm fine<br/>
Swear these bitches done lost it lately<br/>
You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated<br/>
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it<br/>
I know (I know)<br/>
I got a problem, I'mma take care of it<br/>
Weight I'm carrying, gotta let it go<br/>
(It won't hold me down no more)<br/>
<br/>
I made a promise to my momma<br/>
That I'll bless her with some grandkids, she can spoil them<br/>
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta<br/>
Can a man live? And it's all day (homie)<br/>
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get them all paid<br/>
Came a long way from all-state, yeah<br/>
Now we All-American, we All-American<br/>
<br/>
We ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
We ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
We can't be stopped now<br/>
Cause this rap shit's for life<br/>
We ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
We ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
We can't be stopped now<br/>
Cause this rap shit's for life<br/>
<br/>
Back then I had a dream<br/>
I'll get this money, man<br/>
I know, my life would change<br/>
Just need a hundred grand<br/>
Back then I had a dream<br/>
I'll get this money, man<br/>
I know, my life would change<br/>
Just need a hundred grand<br/>
(Back when I first made a hundred grand...)<br/>
<br/>
(Back when I first made a hundred grand...)<br/>
(Yeah, back when I first made a...)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[100 Grand]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand, thought I was the shit<br/>
When I first made a hundred grand, thought I was a king<br/>
When I first made a hundred grand, couldn't tell me nuttin<br/>
When I first made a hundred grand, made a hundred grand<br/>
(Let me get some money)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, okay, back then they used to call me little<br/>
But now I'm ridin' something clean in a coat made of armadillo<br/>
They haven't got the memo, they sayin' I'm the shit though<br/>
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple<br/>
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is<br/>
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius<br/>
Each and every day some save me please<br/>
And get schooled, homie, change degrees<br/>
I'm the plug, what you need though?<br/>
I'm goin' beast mode<br/>
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat<br/>
(Wait what?)<br/>
I made a mil' before I pay the bill<br/>
Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a NAVY seal<br/>
Come with me, I can make your life change for real<br/>
Always had a dream of stuntin'<br/>
It ain't nothing unless we runnin' shit<br/>
Just a young motherfucker with a plan<br/>
Thought I was the man<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand, thought I was the shit<br/>
When I first made a hundred grand, thought I was a king<br/>
When I first made a hundred grand, couldn't tell me nuttin<br/>
When I first made a hundred grand, made a hundred grand<br/>
(Let me get some money)<br/>
<br/>
Let me get some money (Time flies)<br/>
Let me, let me get some money (Yeah, you know time flies)<br/>
I just need some shoes my niece (Try to catch it)<br/>
Can we stop at Chipotle?<br/>
Let me get some money (Time flies)<br/>
Let me, let me get some money (yeah, you know time flies)<br/>
Let me get some money (Try to catch it)<br/>
Let me, let me get some money
