<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby if I don't have money (What)<br/>
Then I don't have a heart beat (That's right)<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
When you see it on the marquee<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I usually write rhymes in the blackberry<br/>
But I went back to the pen for this one<br/>
So I'm a let my fingers do the talkin'<br/>
And she probably what they talkin bout (Uhg Huh)<br/>
Girl you got to listen (Uhhh)<br/>
I'm in this situation where you got me sittin' waitin'<br/>
And I'm losin' all my patience<br/>
I just need a vacation (Vacation)<br/>
Your friends all player hatin' (What?)<br/>
Cause I'm the one you always stay awake with and spend the day with<br/>
Always wanna walk ya home<br/>
And you hate the way my day to day is on the road (It's okay)<br/>
Front row know every single song<br/>
When she know she comin' home with me she always bring her thong<br/>
Bring her lingerie whatever moods she in<br/>
But a movie in<br/>
Got the lights dim<br/>
We gone make love til nights end<br/>
Have you callin up ya friends like oww I like him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby if I don't have money (What)<br/>
Then I don't have a heart beat (That's right)<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
When you see it on the marquee<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I know I take ya breath away darling<br/>
Smooth playa treat you like a princess (uh huh)<br/>
Cause love tricky like parallel parking (Ah hah)<br/>
A business I won't invest<br/>
But I show interest in that slim waist of yours<br/>
And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours<br/>
Givin' you flavors that you ain't even taste before<br/>
We gone make love til you achin' sore (achin' sore)<br/>
And baby don't worry I'm a be rich<br/>
Name in the neon lights (In the neon lights)<br/>
So how about you give me that kiss<br/>
Cause you don't want to sleep tonight<br/>
Your one night love gone get swept off ya feet<br/>
Yeah let's get undressed from your breast to ya feet (breast to ya feet)<br/>
Light a cigarette just to stay awake<br/>
Liquor got us bangin like a 808<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby if I don't have money (What)<br/>
Then I don't have a heart beat (That's right)<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
When you see it on the marquee<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
(Throw your hands up people party all night<br/>
Celebrate my name in the neon lights) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
(Throw your hands up (You gone love my name) <i>[x3]</i>)<br/>
You gone love my name (Throw your hands up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby if I don't have money (What)<br/>
Then I don't have a heart beat (That's right)<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
When you see it on the marquee<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
(See the neon lights)<br/>
In the neon lights<br/>
I know you gone love my name<br/>
I know you gone love my name
