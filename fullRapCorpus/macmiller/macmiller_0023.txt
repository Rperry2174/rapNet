I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million cause<br/>
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
With ease, I'm a make a million<br/>
<br/>
A lotta times I don't get the credit<br/>
Forgettin about my ethical work<br/>
Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread<br/>
I been dedicatin' ever since I turned head<br/>
Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads<br/>
I been workin', part time hustla<br/>
Hit you with a dub feedin bubblas<br/>
Got this brah<br/>
On the road with a dollar and a dream<br/>
Cause anything is possible, believe bitch please<br/>
It ain't nothin to spit, sparkin up in the whip<br/>
Stayin stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement<br/>
No one ever sees a legend when he stuck on the bench<br/>
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench<br/>
My head can't contain these dreams of mine<br/>
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna leave behind<br/>
For now, it's food for thought it'll feed your mind<br/>
But you can't get a piece of mind (naw homie)<br/>
<br/>
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million cause<br/>
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
With ease, I'm a make a million<br/>
<br/>
Now, I can either try and be a hero<br/>
Or I can grab a one with six zeros<br/>
What would I do with a million dollars?<br/>
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father<br/>
Then pay for college, get (3J) a camera<br/>
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta<br/>
Cop a phantom just to ride in<br/>
Some celebrity friends to get high with<br/>
Couple four models that I find dime with<br/>
Cause the music that I make is timeless<br/>
The pressures on don't choke, heimlich manuever<br/>
Got my songs off of your computer<br/>
You wonderin' is it buzzin' just a rumor<br/>
I'm Superman, ya'll just Lex Luther<br/>
I'm a make a mil, that's fo real no deal<br/>
Just the illest mo' fucka in the bill so chill<br/>
<br/>
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million cause<br/>
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
With ease, I'm a make a million<br/>
<br/>
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million cause<br/>
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen<br/>
Bitch please, I'm a make a million<br/>
With ease, I'm a make a million
