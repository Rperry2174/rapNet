<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets<br/>
Roll around like I run this shit<br/>
I got a system filled up with toxins<br/>
I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch<br/>
Getting high to deal with my problems<br/>
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit<br/>
But these bitches getting obnoxious<br/>
They nothin' to me though I love this shit<br/>
Go long days, longer nights<br/>
Talk too much, the wrong advice<br/>
All the lights, and call my life<br/>
Doctor, doctor, will you help me<br/>
Keep me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be<br/>
Ain't shit you can tell me now<br/>
Fuck this rap shit, bitch I'm sellin' out<br/>
Ooh shit, my new bitch jealous now<br/>
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now<br/>
All the pain that they causin' like fuck it we ballin' now everythin' straight<br/>
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm living away<br/>
Conversations we having, I'm getting too static, too much on my plate<br/>
Lord, I need me a break<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel &amp; Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
But I be good by the weekend<br/>
I be good by the weekend<br/>
Everything good by the weekend<br/>
Everything will be good by the weekend<br/>
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, like fuck it<br/>
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, fuck it<br/>
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight<br/>
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
I been having trouble sleeping<br/>
Battling these demons<br/>
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing<br/>
Is it money, fame or neither<br/>
I been thinking about the places that I frequent<br/>
All the people that I see<br/>
I’m just out here livin' decent<br/>
What do it mean to be a G?<br/>
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy<br/>
She ain't god as I, make water wine, pause in time<br/>
It's common, they often hate me<br/>
Never will I walk in line, I cross the Ts and dot the Is<br/>
Wondering well, wonderin' how I got this high<br/>
Fell asleep and forgot to die, god damn<br/>
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded<br/>
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browsers like how did I make it<br/>
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked<br/>
Don't even know what today is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel &amp; Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
But I be good by the weekend<br/>
I be good by the weekend<br/>
Everything good by the weekend<br/>
Everything will be good by the weekend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel:]</i><br/>
Mondays I think of you<br/>
But I ain’t tripping on it<br/>
Tuesdays I’m in<br/>
Gotta get my hands up on ya<br/>
Wednesdays I'm lit with you<br/>
You know you're staying over<br/>
Thursdays I’m sick of you<br/>
I got to get rid of you<br/>
Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of my life, alright<br/>
When I get faded you hate it but, baby, it’s gonna be alright, ha, alright
