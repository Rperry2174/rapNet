In a room filled with holographic images<br/>
Path is limitless, death that's ridiculous<br/>
I'm a live forever cause a legend never die<br/>
See the world is simple, but complex in the design<br/>
I spent some time just thinkin'<br/>
Where did that get me?<br/>
High, more drinkin'<br/>
Now my head empty<br/>
So can it last a couple minutes more?<br/>
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source<br/>
Bear witness while I'm checking bitches off my hit list<br/>
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted<br/>
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia<br/>
Until I figure out the perfect world the lonely one<br/>
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun<br/>
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they're too slow to run<br/>
Mac Miller I'm the only one<br/>
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium<br/>
<br/>
Got my middle finger up with a cup<br/>
And a dutch split, hands on my nuts<br/>
While I'm wildin' out in public<br/>
Welcome to America<br/>
Motherfucker, welcome to America <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Still in a room filled with holographic images<br/>
Crushing information into powder then I'm sniffin' it<br/>
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed<br/>
I learn that the future death of you adjusting to the fed<br/>
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest<br/>
Hop into a jag, get some rest to the things of stress<br/>
G this is what I do the best<br/>
Nothing that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest<br/>
Save hard, a brave heart, a warrior<br/>
I take caution, stay far from coroners<br/>
I heard some corny words said about my music though<br/>
Talkin' all that shit sound exactly like a groupie hoe<br/>
Most dope, got you hooked, yellow roofie oh<br/>
First you lose you mind then you lose your soul<br/>
So what you talkin' about? Given you're out of options<br/>
American border, pipper but formal, above and beyond, Medal of Honor<br/>
<br/>
Got my middle finger up with a cup<br/>
And a dutch split, hands on my nuts<br/>
While I'm wildin' out in public<br/>
Welcome to America<br/>
Motherfucker, welcome to America <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? bet I steal her,<br/>
Said I'm on my way to Mac Miller<br/>
Comin' up in a world full of killers<br/>
I'll be shaded up at the villa,<br/>
With a girl that know that know what the deal is,<br/>
Yeah they know I came from the illest<br/>
City on a map, we don't know that<br/>
Release young rap, go getters of America<br/>
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go<br/>
CV and Mac meezy takin' off them PJ's<br/>
We the future so every night is a new day<br/>
Sittin' in the studio, chain on my hat low<br/>
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show<br/>
I can trigger the wave in my sleep<br/>
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat<br/>
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat<br/>
Spit one flow and got made on the streets<br/>
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free<br/>
Swag worth a mill, drive cass but the deal badges<br/>
<br/>
Got my middle finger up with a cup<br/>
And a dutch put his hands on my nuts<br/>
While I'm wildin' out in public<br/>
Welcome to America<br/>
Motherfucker, welcome to America <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now to drop hot shit, running out of patience nigga snot sick<br/>
Rolling up the dankest loud plane going mach 6<br/>
Rise to the top and top a change the glocks in the stock<br/>
Exchange that watch the price of the life on the block<br/>
Drop insane, you can't stop this rain<br/>
Dope name drop in vane<br/>
In hells sides a lake from tropic strange towards aqua strange<br/>
Last week you was nothing boxers stain<br/>
Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame<br/>
So the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow<br/>
No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scopes<br/>
Sun got shine, now he said he said but he never did but no<br/>
Still facing L's you would he the niggas wins was low<br/>
What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who invented dope<br/>
In the flow we'll be off by dropping prison soap<br/>
Begging for forgiveness but the spinnin's though<br/>
I'm record spittin' in these flows<br/>
Got it up as this snotty up in the stow
