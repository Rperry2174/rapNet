<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Yeah, well you can be my<br/>
Said you can be my<br/>
Yeah, you can be my<br/>
Yeah, okay, well you can be my<br/>
Baby you can be my<br/>
Baby you can be my<br/>
<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Okay, well you can be my...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>

Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Said you can be my...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Said you could be my...<br/>
<br/>
Well, you ain't in the mood to argue<br/>
Baby don't you worry, this some shit to get along to<br/>
Some shit I right my wrongs to<br/>
Well, I've tried to call you, have us a discussion<br/>
We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'<br/>
I'll think of something to say, I always do<br/>
I'm in love with the way that you say my name<br/>
Every time it sound brand new<br/>
<br/>
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be<br/>
I say we sound better than you or me<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could be my... (woo!)<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Yeah, I feel like you can be my...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
And I can be your...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Only if you be my...<br/>
It's alright, it's okay<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, okay, and time will tell<br/>
If I'm alive and well, cause when I'm by myself<br/>
I find that I keep flying high, sometimes I must remind myself<br/>
That change is more than pennies laying on the floor inside the well<br/>
You cross my mind, do not apologize for being fine as hell<br/>
I'm spinning here inside your spell, my mind has start to wander<br/>
I missed a day, I stay up late admiring your posture<br/>
<br/>
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be<br/>
I say we sound better than you or me<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could be my...<br/>
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
And baby you can be my...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
And I can be your...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Yeah, only if you be my...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cee-Lo Green:]</i><br/>
There's no more you or me, me or we, sweetheart<br/>
Just be your sweet babe<br/>
And I can see, I can see, so much better<br/>
I can see<br/>
I'm carefully, precious things fall apart<br/>
Just let them be, let it be, forever<br/>
Oh, loving me, in spite of me<br/>
Bless your heart, bless your heart<br/>
I can breathe, I can breathe so much better, yeah<br/>
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no<br/>
We are we, we are we, forever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
You can be my...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Yeah, I feel like you can be my...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
And I can be your...<br/>
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay<br/>
Only if you be my...<br/>
It's alright, it's okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cee-Lo Green:]</i><br/>
