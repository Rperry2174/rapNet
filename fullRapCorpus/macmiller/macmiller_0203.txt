In your old man voice<br/>
Yeah, a one two, a one two<br/>
For one two, for one two<br/>
For one two, for one two<br/>
For one two, for one two<br/>
Uh uh nothin’ but rhymes its quite simple<br/>
<br/>
Hey its what I create to eliminate the hate<br/>
Illuminate the night in the lightning<br/>
UFO sightings leave ‘em unidentified<br/>
Steady I be getting high<br/>
You ain’t got no herbal I’ma lend you mine<br/>
Its Doctor Octagon call him young phenomenon<br/>
I leave these rappers starving like its Ramadan<br/>
You are the wackest my style holographic<br/>
Had to put my city on the map shit<br/>
If you a fat kid go get active<br/>
If you a bad bitch then be a actress<br/>
Rap ease carnage, my family ain't the Partrige<br/>
Hard tricks flawless, trapeze artists<br/>
Take my life and put it in a photo album<br/>
How much money do I got? I don’t know who’s countin’<br/>
Fake muthafucka’s round me I could do without them<br/>
You keepin’ it a hundred I could use a thousand<br/>
I’m comin’ now, call a truce<br/>
I got a lot but, not to lose<br/>
I’m the shit makin’ hits call me Doctor Luke<br/>
And prescribing you a vibe for that awful mood<br/>
Why you sad all the time?<br/>
Jump off a roof<br/>
While I’m kicking it with Q-tip and Posdnuos<br/>
Tryna put me down well that’s futile ooh child<br/>
Supernatural message got you spooked out<br/>
Believe in God but don’t believe religion<br/>
Saying its the truth but never really listened<br/>
That’s another conversation though<br/>
Walking on the pavement home find a way to go<br/>
Maybe one might take the word Robert Frost<br/>
Blowin’ out steam but its all exhaust<br/>
We comin’ for your dollars better call the cops<br/>
You want a war? we got a nuclear holocaust<br/>
Yo E how many bars is that<br/>
Is it enough to give these haters all heart attacks<br/>
I been writing on the paper<br/>
Gave me carpal tunnel<br/>
Couple billion people are they all gon’ love you?<br/>
Hell no, hell no<br/>
I be grindin’ though the rain, sleet, hail, snow<br/>
Sticking to my word like its Velcro<br/>
On some shell toes, what else yo<br/>
Dope shit, go crazy<br/>
Kinda like the internet over Hov’s baby<br/>
My girl tell me Mac you a wierdo<br/>
I guarantee that baby be a super hero<br/>
This ain’t nothin’ but comes rhymes from my mind<br/>
That been stuck inside since the beginning of time<br/>
Chemical romance, slow dance with no pants<br/>
If I got my eyes on her playa you got no chance<br/>
This some simple shit I’m sure they fear<br/>
I’m just trying to explore whats real<br/>
Child of the blues never liked school<br/>
Been miseducated so word to Lauran hill<br/>
Music is my outlet walking through the polo store<br/>
In the studio wondering what I go home for<br/>
In my own world when I close the door<br/>
To the booth, young and searching for the truth<br/>
Like that, like that, like that, like that<br/>
And a little bit of this and a little bit of that<br/>
I just spit a rhyme tell me that I kick a rap<br/>
And if you got time, you can sit down<br/>
Listen to me now, pass the flow around<br/>
Hey thats some cypher shit, I know you like that shit<br/>
Freestyle in the air go and write that shit<br/>
I don’t write that bitch I got ill flows<br/>
Yeah I’m ill yo<br/>
And this is real yo<br/>
Mac Miller, gon’ kill those flows<br/>
Bouncing up and and down Yoyo’s<br/>
Head to ya toes<br/>
In the paint throwin’ bows
