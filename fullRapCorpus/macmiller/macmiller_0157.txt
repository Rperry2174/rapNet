Yea, and I can't feel my legs, I'm a paraplegic<br/>
Lord, I want a fair one with my demons<br/>
Cam Myers became married to Jesus<br/>
Born dead, they had to dig up my fetus<br/>
And now the devil want to tear me to pieces<br/>
I'm a diagnosed insomniac<br/>
An astronaut who blasted off into the stars galactic<br/>
On top of Saturn, fox-trotting with Velociraptors<br/>
The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs<br/>
Preparing for the rapture, closet hillbilly with the spinners on the tractor<br/>
I listen to Uncle Kracker<br/>
But, that's white America for you, we all that matters<br/>
I'm walking backwards, shadowboxing with karate masters<br/>
It's more to rap, we sell the royal crack at Castle Rock<br/>
A bad apple like an unemployed Macintosh<br/>
We lost jobs<br/>
Now they brainwashed with dot com<br/>
It's only so long before we surrender the free world to Hong Kong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And centers stay still, but the merry go round, and round<br/>
It all just keeps spinning<br/>
Gotta keep swimming<br/>
Eat drink and let the merry go round<br/>
Eat drink and let the merry go round<br/>
<br/>
I got a double sided silver dollar<br/>
Larry Fish here from midget league, beginner slaughter<br/>
I'm not drowning, I'm waiting in the water<br/>
Killing off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra<br/>
I got horses on my PJ's<br/>
Shout to spitta jet life, I fit the Porsches on the PJ's<br/>
On stage, sending dark forces to my DJ<br/>
The birdies on tour like PGA<br/>
Davis love the third, Pittsburgh warrior<br/>
Bullets in my cornea<br/>
In exelsis Deo, ayo, this is Gloria<br/>
Ave, Ave Maria, I'm getting bread, yeast rise on Easter<br/>
Money is God<br/>
Black beaches with jungle fever I love to be on<br/>
You on the B-Team I fuck with Solange<br/>
All my life they said I doesn't belong<br/>
So I'm chilling, growing drugs on my lawn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, what what<br/>
Have you found a way out?<br/>
Have you found a way out?<br/>
Vacation in Slovakia, celebrating Mardi Gras<br/>
Eating baklava and lobster claw through a <i>[?]</i><br/>
With Mafia immigrants<br/>
Finna take 'em on a pilgrimage<br/>
Have you found a way out?
