<i>[Chorus (Wiz Khalifa):]</i><br/>
Got no problems<br/>
My weed lit <br/>
Got no where to go<br/>
So we ride <br/>
And we smoke<br/>
Til we cant anymore<br/>
And keep floatin<br/>
Uh,<br/>
Pass it to your man and roll another one<br/>
And keep floatin'<br/>
When its almost done<br/>
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one<br/>
And roll me some<br/>
And keep floatin' <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse (Mac Miller):]</i><br/>
And you can pass that<br/>
The kid who rock a snap back<br/>
Steady blow this hash back<br/>
Until my thoughts are abstract<br/>
How to get by<br/>
Thats how we livin in this day and age<br/>
I bring some color to a world thats filled with shades of gray<br/>
Throwin this cake away<br/>
<br/>
To blaze and sip some tanqueray<br/>
Remember spectatin till they pick the kid to play the game<br/>
Now I'm an all star blast it out the ballpark<br/>
In my Lamborghini speedin your a golf cart<br/>
California dreams<br/>
Amsterdam reality<br/>
Life ain't what it seems these the thoughts the weed pull out of me<br/>
Blow through a thousand trees<br/>
The whole entire crowd can see<br/>
Livin in what seems to be fiction I'm on a balcony<br/>
I Light one up this for those whoever doubted me<br/>
Then light another this for those who hold it down for me<br/>
Passin around the weed <br/>
No problems at all<br/>
And  you haters keep on hatin man I ain't talkin to yall
