That good times can be a trap<br/>
Oh yea?<br/>
Oh hell naw<br/>
Check myself intro rehab<br/>
Yeah, um... I might die before I detox<br/>
You piece of shit<br/>
Now that's a bar<br/>
I'm gonna save that one for a little bit<br/>
Now let me come with something else, you feel me?<br/>
<br/>
This Air Jordon on my flip-flops<br/>
And kill me now if I did it all for hip-hop<br/>
I might die before I detox<br/>
This ain't high-school, no little Asian I can cheat off<br/>
We keep chiefing while police watch<br/>
Loss in vibration sirens blowing up the weed spot<br/>
And Heisman hopefuls all growing up to be cops<br/>
Chasing after gangsters but they never find the G spot<br/>
I'm reporting like I die tomorrow<br/>
At the rate I'm getting high, it'll be hard for me to find tomorrow<br/>
But I just pray that I'll survive tomorrow<br/>
As she cries in sorrow, she just needs some time to borrow<br/>
She'll be smiling by tomorrow<br/>
Everything will be so fine tomorrow<br/>
Put the white away, we can do some lines tomorrow<br/>
Come say hi tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Hello<br/>
And I’ll be damned if this ain’t some shit<br/>
And I’ll be damned if this ain’t some shit<br/>
Here I am<br/>
Oh... I know you see me<br/>
Here I am<br/>
Yeah... and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit but here I am!<br/>
<br/>
I'm the only suicidal motherfucker with a smile on<br/>
Let's hold hands and sing the bible, that's a violent song<br/>
The high-strung, eyes-low, ride along<br/>
Everybody, grab a fucking number, this a dieathon<br/>
Oh I'm the bomb, literally back away, I'm the bomb<br/>
Let me get my line on<br/>
85 grand get you a heavy ass wrist<br/>
They ain't killin' they just yellin', that's it<br/>
A deadly combination with that ecstasy sniff<br/>
On the phone probably yellin' out rich<br/>
Say, double the money, please, double the money<br/>
Triple the problems, double the money<br/>
They was all laughing, wasn't that funny<br/>
I started fucking with drugs and now I'm a junky<br/>
The U-S of A, I fuck with my country<br/>
But Uncle Sam could never teach me how to Dougie<br/>
I'm thinking till my brain pops<br/>
Spitting as a cake walk<br/>
I'm just a rapper, guess I'm sticking to my day job<br/>
Wiz getting faded, come and kick it at a bake shop<br/>
Everything is A-1, steak sauce<br/>
<br/>
Thank God<br/>
God Damn it<br/>
Thank God<br/>
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit<br/>
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
