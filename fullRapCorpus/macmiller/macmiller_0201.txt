<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
You see that glow that high gloss<br/>
That high gloss, that high gloss<br/>
You see that glow, that high gloss<br/>
That high gloss, that high gloss<br/>
Here we go…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller - Verse 1]</i><br/>
I fuck around with them playmates<br/>
Twenty thousand my day rate<br/>
Eating seven course meals now<br/>
People say that I gained weight<br/>
All you rappers you ain’t safe<br/>
More money same face<br/>
Been the shit still the shit<br/>
Just double up, exchange rate<br/>
Guess who just grown up now<br/>
You can all sit the fuck down<br/>
Had to speak to P, said I need the beat<br/>
To show these clowns I don’t fuck around<br/>
Asking me about money, wonder what’s my net worth<br/>
People try to come sue me, but I call up J.G. Wentworth<br/>
Yeah I glow, they don’t<br/>
I suppose let ‘em go<br/>
Spend 10 racks on my coat<br/>
Fuck a whip just bought me a boat<br/>
My flow is gross<br/>
Be bread, get it I was toast<br/>
Without one, you reaching<br/>
You ain't close, get it, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh you ain’t now (oh you ain’t now)<br/>
Since I was born (since I was born)<br/>
My mind was gone (my mind was gone)<br/>
Know I was poor<br/>
Don’t mind any bitch I just go (I just go)<br/>
And my wrist was cold (wrist was cold)<br/>
My world was snow (my world was snow)<br/>
What I need light fo’<br/>
Girl I’m white as a bitch, I just glow<br/>
I’m so special (I’m so special)<br/>
I’m so special (I’m so special)<br/>
I’m so special (I’m so special)<br/>
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow<br/>
I’m so special (I’m so special)<br/>
I’m so special (I’m so special)<br/>
I’m so special (I’m so special)<br/>
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller - Verse 2]</i><br/>
I rap a lot, rap a lot, don’t be afraid it’s just after shock<br/>
Yeah jam like when Shaq grab the rock<br/>
I’m going in like a Magic shot<br/>
Don’t rap sweet like apricots<br/>
Shut the fuck up you don’t have to talk<br/>
I’ma lay back with my ass on top<br/>
Got the game on match a lot muthafucker<br/>
You don’t see cash a lot, bitch stop acting like you bad you not<br/>
I put my dick in her ass and twat and she look back like thats the spot<br/>
Call me, I’m counting money, play around with money<br/>
Y’all ain’t shit without ya money<br/>
Life ain't all about the money<br/>
Well it kinda is if you out of money<br/>
Mac Millions that’s the name<br/>
Most dope that’s the game<br/>
Drunk bitch so glad you came<br/>
Saw her taking off her clothes tryin have the train<br/>
Hoes love us, tryna fuck us with no rubbers<br/>
Fuck that, we fuck each other, on tour we make her fuck the runner<br/>
Muthafucker just shit you need<br/>
You ain’t fuck around my team<br/>
Cause you living all of your dreams<br/>
Here to kill your self esteem<br/>
And my flow is pyro<br/>
Smoke blunts 'til my eyes close<br/>
Middle finger up high though<br/>
End this song on a high note<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I’m just eating that pink slime<br/>
Bitch that pink slime<br/>
Muthafuckerrrrrrr...!!!
