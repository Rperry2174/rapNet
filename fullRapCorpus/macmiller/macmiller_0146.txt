<i>[Intro: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
1, 2, 3, pop, pop<br/>
1, 2, 3, pop, pop<br/>
1, 2, 3, pop, pop<br/>
(Mr. Davis)<br/>
1, 2, 3, pop, pop<br/>
Okay<br/>

Okay, O-kay-kay-kay-kay<br/>
Okay, okay, um<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Snowflakes keep falling on my expired debit cards<br/>
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at 10 tomorrow<br/>
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty regular<br/>
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car<br/>
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks<br/>
And everyday is full of jokers like a deck of cards<br/>
So, I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome-piece<br/>
But, I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfucking Minotaur<br/>
Oh my God, look at how upset you are<br/>
Cause we out here winning, brought my dogs from out the reservoir<br/>
And I'mma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start<br/>
We forgot our roots before and trust me, things they fell apart<br/>
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart<br/>
My conscious so weak I need to split it up in 7 parts<br/>
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time<br/>
Went to Amare's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart<br/>
But Kevin don't remember that<br/>
I saw him at the V-M-A's, told a joke - he never laughed<br/>
The rap diablo, free your mind my motto<br/>
And we all gonna be good if TreeJ ever hit the lotto<br/>
So arigato<br/>
So, shit you know I'm world famous<br/>
And R. Kelly been told me I'm the world's greatest<br/>
But still to fall in love is like an orgasm<br/>
Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it<br/>
I'm always faded, getting shaded in the basement<br/>
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it<br/>
Thank God that I made it<br/>
Ask Q where Dave is<br/>
He'll probably tell you that he's rolling midnights out in Vegas<br/>
When I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent<br/>
Wear a suit to cash a check, we're going to the banquet<br/>
And Jimmy got the burner, but he don't wanna murder<br/>
And clockwork somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like<br/>
(Husband, isn't this your language?)<br/>
That man must be a alien<br/>
I really can't explain it, shit<br/>
It's just a little cocaine sniff<br/>
But the lines is longer than parades is<br/>
I think it's time to give me all your praises<br/>
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises<br/>
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit<br/>
And if you wanna legal battle - send your ass to David (that's my lawyer)<br/>
I'm half man-half amazing<br/>
Probably half God, but that don't fit my calculations<br/>
I know the planet Earth is about to explode<br/>
Kinda hope that no one save it<br/>
We only grow from anguish<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
Yea, Miller Mac<br/>
(Miller Mac)<br/>
Miller Mac, Mac Miller<br/>
(Miller Mac)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
There's snowflakes falling on my debit card<br/>
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are<br/>
In this Game of Thrones, it is known<br/>
I got the 4G, L-T-E connection boards<br/>
No Control, fuck Ken Lamar (Fuck you Kendrick!)<br/>
I don't vote, I never registered<br/>
But I'm a magnet for them zeros call me Edward Sharpe<br/>
I wake up feeling dead, I need a fresher start<br/>
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember<br/>
Smiled as I saw Jerm, nerding out with Josh Berg<br/>
Talking in <i>[?]</i>, and drinking Arnold Palmer<br/>
Any other room, watching C-Span with E. Dan<br/>
Land out the baseline, doing drums with his freehand<br/>
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican<br/>
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows<br/>
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids<br/>
But the lady said my hair was too short though, man<br/>
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit<br/>
Driving through the hood she did not have a reaction<br/>
With a 6 year old she kept the doors unlocked<br/>
And drove by the 5-0 like fuck those cops<br/>
God damn, it just don't stop<br/>
I know my father probably wish I would just smoke pot<br/>
My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got<br/>
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Yea, I've had the same outfit for 6 days straight<br/>
And Still all these bitches will get in position because I got their pussies all dripping in pain<br/>
Somehow, I'm making this music it's just to relate to<br/>
And I got the life-raft, ain't gonna save you<br/>
Look at my reflection, I broke the mirror<br/>
It's only for protection, shit keep getting weirder<br/>
Now I can't see a thing but, things never been clearer<br/>
Call the Mothman its Richard Gere (It's Richard Mother Fuckin' Gere!)<br/>
This is our year<br/>
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here<br/>
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere<br/>
And looking down like<br/>
We come in peace<br/>
I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit<br/>
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage<br/>
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit<br/>
<br/>
