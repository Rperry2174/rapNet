<i>[Phonte:]</i><br/>
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there<br/>
For the good times or bad, I'll be there<br/>
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there<br/>
For the good times or bad, I'll be there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
See I was 6 years old with a dream, when my mums told me I can do anything<br/>
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather<br/>
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together<br/>
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan<br/>
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand<br/>
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family<br/>
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity<br/>
It ain't about the vanity, think bout what's important<br/>
The reason I was 6 years old rocking some Jordans<br/>
The reason I had food, my own damn room<br/>
A TV and a living room to watch my cartoons<br/>
I just hope she know I love her, the World's best mother<br/>
Yeah ain't fair, so I'm a take care of her and her gray hair<br/>
When I get rich, I'll have her living how she should be<br/>
No stress, no worries, you can call me cause it's...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phonte:]</i><br/>
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there<br/>
For the good times or bad, I'll be there<br/>
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there<br/>
For the good times or bad, I'll be there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
Dear mama, please don't start to cry<br/>
You the reason I'm alive how these years have gone by<br/>
You were there when I was on my first bike riding in the street<br/>
That delivery truck almost ran right over me<br/>
You were at my games when I was sitting on the bench<br/>
When I skipped school, you lied saying I was home sick<br/>
Had my back before I had my own<br/>
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home<br/>
I just wanna bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation<br/>
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation<br/>
If you have your moms, you better treat her right<br/>
Call her up, say "wassup" before you sleep tonight<br/>
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did<br/>
You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you, shit<br/>
You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh<br/>
I wanna tell you momma...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phonte:]</i><br/>
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there<br/>
For the good times or bad, I'll be there<br/>
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there<br/>
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
