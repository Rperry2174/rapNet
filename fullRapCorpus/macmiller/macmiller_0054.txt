I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,<br/>
But now she think she got it like that,<br/>
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,<br/>
Mmm I think she think she got it like that,<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
Just make sure you give it back,<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
If you got somethin' to match,<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back,<br/>
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap,<br/>
Then we could go outside, let me take you for a ride<br/>
With the top down show you off to people you my prize,<br/>
Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes,<br/>
Shinin' like my high beams cooler than some ice tea,<br/>
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email,<br/>
Professional with shop and you would think she worked at retail,<br/>
Snapbacks make ‘em look so cute, and that girl know how to blow<br/>
Somethin’ like she played the flute,<br/>
That long hair and it’s fallin’ down her back,<br/>
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it,<br/>
Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch, <br/>
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can’t have this,<br/>
She smiled big, kissin’ on my cheek,<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
Just make sure you give it back,<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
If you got somethin' to match,<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that<br/>
<br/>
She like to play her stupid games with me,<br/>
She never seem to have enough,<br/>
She brought some friends for whoever came with me,<br/>
So, my homies sayin’ that’s what’s up,<br/>
And I hear her name’s pretty from different continent<br/>
Tellin’ me she’s single but to tell the truth I’m not convinced,<br/>
It’s all good I’m used to boyfriends always talkin’ shit,<br/>
Thinkin’ that they players but I’m coach call me Popovich,<br/>
Baby I ain’t doctor rich, but I’ll probably show you a good night,<br/>
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right,<br/>
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight,<br/>
And we ain’t seen her since so tell me what does that look like,<br/>
I’m the type to bring you right back down to earth,<br/>
And for what it’s worth I’ll put that Louis on your purse,<br/>
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I’m guessin’ she a keeper,<br/>
I think she stole it though I keep tryin’ to reach her<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
Just make sure you give it back,<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
If you got somethin' to match,<br/>
<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back<br/>
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat,<br/>
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that<br/>
<br/>
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,<br/>
But now she think she got it like that,<br/>
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat,<br/>
Damn, I think she think she got it like that
