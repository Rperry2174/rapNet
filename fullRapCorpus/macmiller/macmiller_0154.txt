Okay, you work a God damn lousy job, you know<br/>
You come home at night, you're tired<br/>
What are you going to do? Go to a movie? Turn on your radio?<br/>
Hell no you're going to get a bottle of whiskey and drink it<br/>
And go down to a bar and maybe get in a fist fight<br/>
And meet some bitch, something's going on<br/>
Then you'll go to work the next day, and do your simple little things, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, yeah<br/>
My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she looking past it<br/>
The smile that she faking is tragic, hate looking at it<br/>
That magic I tried to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics<br/>
Fantasizing love so classic, tragic to what she got up in her attic<br/>
Can we mind fuck?<br/>
Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush don't say a word<br/>
I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word<br/>
I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?<br/>
I hate to end the story, can we wait until the morning to decide on it?<br/>
Spend this time pretending it was that first summer<br/>
It was pure lovers<br/>
She was used to being hurt, I took that curse from her<br/>
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for<br/>
You wish that I would call more<br/>
You're sick of seeing condoms in my sock drawer<br/>
Loves turns to war so quickly<br/>
I envisioned us - married and 50<br/>
Couple of kids that we drop off at little league<br/>
I'm addicted to you<br/>
You only want the best, I need to listen to you<br/>
I'm fucking other girls wishing it's you<br/>
Fuck the bullshit, we in love<br/>
I'm a mess but can you clean me up?<br/>
<br/>
Girl I'm the worst<br/>
Yea, I know that I'm the worst<br/>
Yea, but you're something I can't lose<br/>
Just let me tell you the truth, that'll be the first<br/>
Girl I'm the worst<br/>
Yea, I know that I'm the worst<br/>
Don't know what I gotta do, just love you so much that it hurts<br/>
<br/>
And I see you falling victim to the thirst<br/>
All the sins you committed you could probably use a couple minutes in church<br/>
But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect<br/>
There's an angel hiding underneath your surface<br/>
You're the woman of my dreams, I'm looking at her sleep<br/>
The pussy right in-front of me, I shouldn't be so weak<br/>
What did I do to deserve a love like this?<br/>
You see her shining? That's my sunlight bitch<br/>
I'm sick of fighting, that smile is so inviting<br/>
I see you every time I'm writing<br/>
I'm losing to all my vices, they kicking my ass<br/>
I hold on to this feeling, I wish it would last<br/>
Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past<br/>
You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?<br/>
Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?<br/>
Gave me all your love and now I'm giving it back<br/>
But I know, that<br/>
<br/>
Girl you the worst<br/>
Yea, you know that you the worst<br/>
But I'm something you can't lose<br/>
If you just told me the truth, that'd be a first, but<br/>
Girl you the worst<br/>
Yea, you know that you the worst<br/>
Every time you say you sorry, everything you do just feel like it's rehearsed
