<i>[Perfect Circle]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Fuck you)<br/>
I came for whoever is in charge<br/>
I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard<br/>
They need some coffee, everybody’s sleeping on me<br/>
Going around door to door, setting off alarms<br/>
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn<br/>
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah<br/>
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made<br/>
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase<br/>
Me and my bizarre ways (no emergency)<br/>
I moved up from a Private to a Sargent<br/>
You can see it in the scar face<br/>
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank<br/>
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade<br/>
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose<br/>
I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth<br/>
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues<br/>
The devil with me and he tell me to shoot<br/>
<br/>
Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?<br/>
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do<br/>
Can you draw a perfect circle?<br/>
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?<br/>
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall<br/>
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)<br/>
Got what you need if you like breaking the law<br/>
My mother raised me a God (Hey)<br/>
(Fuck you)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday<br/>
Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway<br/>
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase<br/>
Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case<br/>
Used to wanna know how a freak taste<br/>
Now I’m in it in an instant like replay<br/>
Bra’s a baton, pass it off like relay<br/>
Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?<br/>
She say “I thought you got sober”<br/>
And I say “I wish you’d stop being a bitch<br/>
And get to minding your business”<br/>
Told me “Money has changed you”<br/>
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?<br/>
How’d I get so egotistical? I’m a Buffalo Soldier<br/>
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer<br/>
I’m only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be<br/>
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies<br/>
<br/>
Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?<br/>
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do<br/>
Can you draw a perfect circle?<br/>
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?<br/>
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall<br/>
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all<br/>
Got what you need if you like breaking the law<br/>
My mother raised me a God (Hey)<br/>
(Fuck you)<br/>
<br/>
A goddess told me “good morning” when I woke up<br/>
(Fuck you)<br/>
You know I had a good morning when I woke up<br/>
(Fuck you)<br/>
Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up<br/>
(Fuck you)<br/>
Would you remember me if I never woke up?<br/>
Bye bye (Fuck you)<br/>
I am a sinner, I’m just tryna sin<br/>
Warm in the winter, and I’ll be on my way<br/>
I’m just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers<br/>
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind<br/>
<br/>
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system 412-9... is not available<br/>
<br/>
“Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays, uhm, I love ya.<br/>
And I hope you have a good night / weekend / I hope I talk to you soon, alright, God Speed”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[God Speed]</i><br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, I thought I’d have it figured out by now<br/>
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past right now<br/>
Me and the homies would be sitting on millions<br/>
Reminiscing when we were so broke and living in Oakland just chillin'<br/>
I thought I’d have it in the bag by now<br/>
I thought that we’d be kicking back by now<br/>
I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch<br/>
I thought we’d put her in a cab by now<br/>
But I’m stressing, I can’t relax<br/>
I swallow my pride and I’m higher than what’s making me mad<br/>
Everybody say I need rehab<br/>
Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long ‘til they watching me crash<br/>
And they don’t wanna see that<br/>
They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother<br/>
Telling her they could have done more to help me, and she’ll be crying saying that she’ll do anything to have me back<br/>
All the nights I’m losing sleep, it was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that<br/>
But white lines be numbing them dark times<br/>
Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up<br/>
It’s a problem, I need a wake up<br/>
Before one morning I don’t wake up<br/>
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya<br/>
I’m too obsessed with going down as a great one<br/>
And if you wait too long, they go find someone to replace ya<br/>
So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever<br/>
And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain’t already yet<br/>
I did my best to be a leader you respect<br/>
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret<br/>
So tell my baby I love her<br/>
And if she give me time I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother<br/>
Just know that there’s a place<br/>
Where all my people free and everybody straight<br/>
Every devil don’t got horns, and every hero don’t got capes<br/>
Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, Good morning<br/>
Yeah, good morning<br/>
<br/>
Yo man, it’s the morning, you gotta go to work<br/>
“alright”<br/>
Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo<br/>
(You good?)<br/>
“I’m straight, yo what’s good?” (when you going?)<br/>
You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?<br/>
“man, fuck that shit, I’ll skip”<br/>
You bout to go to work?<br/>
“mmm”<br/>
Ight, what time you gotta be at work?<br/>
“I don’t know... soon”<br/>
You Democrat or Republican?<br/>
“Uuhh...I don’t know anymore”<br/>
Would you vote for a female president?<br/>
