Lick it, Split it, Twist it, Hit it, Splif it, Pitch it, Roll Anotha. <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Haha, Yo you see they probably wonder why I don't smile<br/>
Cuz this cats need to get there own style<br/>
Hold the phone dial<br/>
I go miles, when I'm sprinting on the beat <br/>
You get lifted of yo feet<br/>
When yo spliffin up my trees<br/>
Quit givin me a speech<br/>
I really tryna hear this<br/>
See with these lyrics<br/>
I'm tryna run fearless<br/>
We playing games in this jungle, Jumanji<br/>
With bomb tree, hidden under all my dirty laundry<br/>
Call me an arm free fucking around <br/>
I'm putting words in your mind<br/>
So you in love with the sound<br/>
They saving my place <br/>
Tryna shove this food in my face<br/>
So they force it down my throat<br/>
Til I'm use to the taste<br/>
Now move to your place<br/>
Cuz I'm campin out on top<br/>
Fresh kicks on my feet <br/>
While you sititn in some socks<br/>
Cops tryna get me lock<br/>
Catch me fucking with shenanigans<br/>
But ill just handle them and throw them in the ambulance<br/>
They want to know what my hands is in <br/>
Scare me straight<br/>
Get back bitch I ain't tryna share my plate<br/>
Whats good fam, I love money, I will marry cake. <br/>
Get a rich bitch like Ashley and Mary Kate.<br/>
And I ain't talking about one of them<br/>
I'm getting both<br/>
I grab them and get a lo<br/>
And then take their money and their coats<br/>
I blow trees, so my mouth is always filled with smoke<br/>
You sniffin coke<br/>
Singing but you haven't hit a note<br/>
<br/>
Plus that shit you wrote isn't set to carry a crowd<br/>
I'm legendary anywhere that I'm out<br/>
I'm sharing this pound <br/>
With my people like a how high sequel<br/>
Told my people need to air out the house<br/>
So beware of my mouth<br/>
Spittin venom, coming out the cerebellum<br/>
With these kicks on my feet,<br/>
See I told you I was gellin<br/>
You playin felon<br/>
You in stealin a penny<br/>
I put a hole in your belly like you oprah or jenny  <br/>
<br/>
Lick it, Split it, Twist it, Hit it, Splif it, Pitch it, Roll Anotha. <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I sport a long white tee, fitted cap, baggy pants.<br/>
If you see me be sure to slap my hand<br/>
Some people do it for the love <br/>
Some peiple do it cuz they can<br/>
But me, I'm tryna be legend like Bag a Vance<br/>
Some rap will make you think<br/>
While other shit will make you dance<br/>
So I bump what ever is in the system <br/>
Tryin to make some plans<br/>
I just want to see whats good for the night time<br/>
IF nothings hype, I'ma head up to crib and write rhymes<br/>
Age like white wine, nicer by the second,<br/>
Thats why I never put punctuation on a sentence<br/>
Cuz the song goes on, here a dope song<br/>
If they say I wasn't for real, then you was told wrong<br/>
See you ain't on, what we on<br/>
You bright, I'm neon <br/>
I'm smoking up the weed till the tree gone<br/>
Yeaahh<br/>
My life is up and down like a sew saw<br/>
So I stay with a Bitch like Leon...Phelps
