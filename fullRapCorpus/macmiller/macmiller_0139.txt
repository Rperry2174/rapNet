<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
From, yeah, from, from, from, from<br/>
Right out the backyard, rhymes out the crack jarred<br/>
The facts are that Mac brought the cash for the caviar<br/>
Laugh hard staying out the way of bad karma<br/>
And black tar covered demons when they have drama<br/>
You latch onto hope, but it ain't working out<br/>
This garden snake you knew done grew into a serpent now<br/>
And my mind is perverted, foul, wow<br/>
My time, you've got to earn it now<br/>
Alright, dance circles around the lava<br/>
And bitches coming over just to twerk around the casa<br/>
Yeah, lemme see that ass, bitch (haha)<br/>
Yeah, as the Virgin Mary get defloured<br/>
Arouse her, and let her put her mouth in my trousers<br/>
Woke up, made a couple million fore I showered<br/>
Spent an hour with Jack Bauer<br/>
And the kids from Rocket Power watching television<br/>
Sometimes the truth is better when it's fiction<br/>
It's never written, never find a bed in prison<br/>
Dealing with addictions<br/>
When I beat it then it's switching to something else<br/>
Shit, I'm only running from myself<br/>
But, I'm running fast and I'm tired<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Da$h]</i><br/>
Fucking sleeping, man<br/>
Give me some fucking orange juice<br/>
Some peyote in that shit<br/>
My whole fucking life is a science experiment (buggin')<br/>
Terrorist rhetoric, instead make the Devil flinch<br/>
Paint his head with gin, the roof is scabbin'<br/>
Finna peel off, sky's teal hand rolling in...<br/>
... bit harder to look at, put a home invasion<br/>
Throw the earnings in my book-bag<br/>
Learned about that Xanax and...<br/>
Ain't nobody really ever taught me how to cook crack, but<br/>
I got about half a rite-aid in my book-bag<br/>
Bitch, I'm always high, that's why I look sad<br/>
Black bag full of kush, burn the same bush<br/>
Moses had a conversation with... bitch Croatian dick<br/>
We wanna train you, finna thank the bitch<br/>
The new wage, Johnny Blaze and shit<br/>
I got the homies in your neighborhood<br/>
Knocking like these niggas lost a dog<br/>
Momma looking for her boy she better call the morgue<br/>
I'm a ball hog, I tell my niggas, I ain't finna pass it<br/>
You ain't gonna dunk, smoking the Hawaiian skunk<br/>
Elephant tusk necklace just to provide the stunt<br/>
Wear a Waldo outfit, you were to find me once<br/>
I hit the ocean floor inside a slut<br/>
Disintegrated to the finest dust, I'm out, nigga<br/>
Like that...
