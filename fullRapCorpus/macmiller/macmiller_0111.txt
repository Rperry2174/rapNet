<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Uhhhahhh<br/>
Top of the morning to you<br/>
You know, it's been so dark outside<br/>
That I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Uh, I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'<br/>
Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in<br/>
Need substance, feed it to the public<br/>
No one gon' touch it like my poppy's old musket<br/>
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns<br/>
Sentence keep runnin', word the double E Cummings<br/>
People say to me that it doesn't mean nothin'<br/>
Bumble bees buzzin' cause the trouble needs lovin'<br/>
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?<br/>
Those are people that which I dedicate this rap today<br/>
If I have to, I'm a crack your face<br/>
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case<br/>
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's<br/>
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway<br/>
Take a shower start singin' like Al Green<br/>
From outside, it probably soundin' like some loud screams<br/>
Always had child dreams and nightmares<br/>
My music like the airport I hop on a flight there<br/>
Wana go to Monaco to see what it's like there<br/>
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like 'Yeah'<br/>
Wassup, here I am, lookin' in the mirror and<br/>
All I see is me, I'm in peace<br/>
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems<br/>
The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'<br/>
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been<br/>
Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes<br/>
Number 1 albums, always givin' you mixtapes<br/>
And that's what I'm a do until I'm richer than Bill Gates<br/>
It ain't all about money for me though<br/>
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego<br/>
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend though<br/>
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo<br/>
Bottles of Cleco, a couple of Cristal<br/>
May head to L.A like I'm Chris Paul<br/>
Bout to go platinum off of missed calls<br/>
So all of y'all can lick balls<br/>
<br/>
Yeuhhh<br/>
Just you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Run from the dark<br/>
Into the light<br/>
You know, you know you're gona find your way out<br/>
Run from the dark<br/>
Into the light<br/>
Oh-woah, you know you're gona find your way<br/>
That's right, into the sunlight <i>[x4]</i>
