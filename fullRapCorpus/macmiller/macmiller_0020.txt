Uh... All Day... Better hide your girl for this one...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day.<br/>
HEY!<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
<br/>
She got a little bit of beauty, little bit of class,<br/>
Little bit of lips, Little bit of ass<br/>
Little bit of style, dressed to kill, little bit of freak, with a sex appeal<br/>
Um, I'm so down for whatever baby, always dressed fresh and wavy,<br/>
Wanna make love, ah yea, that's gravy. late night sex get extra crazy<br/>
Ain't gonna leave em stayin, sick of all the games you playin'<br/>
Eye gazin', sex amazin, got you squintin, eyes look asian<br/>
I know I'm just a kid, ever tell me what this is<br/>
I see you shake, I see you moan, everytime I touch ya lips<br/>
You grab my hand, run your fingers through my hair<br/>
Everywhere we go there's sendin sex all through the air<br/>
Ya, I know you think I'm playin right?<br/>
How bout you take just take a chance, stay the night<br/>
You my baby right? love it when I call you that<br/>
But I follow cash, I'm a have to call you back<br/>
Just know that, you be in my mind<br/>
I say the same thing every single time.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day.<br/>
HEY!<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
<br/>
Ya, I'm amazed, actin like there ain't no time to waste<br/>
She a freak, lemme get her right behind the stage<br/>
My true shorty though, I've had all sorts of hoes,<br/>
Take my time when I'm with her, drink my 40s slow<br/>
And give us a second, you'll find us on the bed<br/>
Wild sex, with her legs behind her head.<br/>
Turn her over on her stomach, get her from the back<br/>
She always leave a scratch, but I like that<br/>
She the type that, you wanna wife that<br/>
And she like me, cause all I do is pipe that<br/>
Buzzin' like a bumble bee, that's chillin by the hive<br/>
Love her with no limits, cause my ceiling in the sky<br/>
Feelin up ya thighs, tongue ticklein ya twine<br/>
When I get it from behind, ya say it's twistin up your spine<br/>
Baby, I'm one of a kind, that finds that spot that have ya climax<br/>
I'm that boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day.<br/>
HEY!<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock<br/>
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
