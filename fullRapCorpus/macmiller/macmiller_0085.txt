I think I see where you’re goin’ with this one E<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that<br/>
Still kick raps in cars and packs, so where’s my kids at?<br/>
These motherfuckers hatin’ sounded funnier than Sinbad<br/>
I’m ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse<br/>
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?<br/>
We the assholes that she warned you about<br/>
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud<br/>
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it’s wild<br/>
6:30 in the mornin’ and there still ain’t signs of slowin’ down<br/>
Twin sisters gettin’ wasted so they both are down<br/>
It’s goin’ down, I thought I told you man<br/>
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
There’s a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)<br/>
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)<br/>
I can be there in like 20<br/>
I’mma hump it and come runnin’, cause we gotta hit the road<br/>
Make you sure you gotta<br/>
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes<br/>
We’re just about there you choose<br/>
We’re at the party on 5th ave tonight<br/>
And that’s what I’m tryna do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey, what’s the difference between me and you?<br/>
When no one believe in you, I’m flyer than beetle juice<br/>
Don't count on the sheep to snooze,<br/>
I'm fucked up off weed and booze<br/>
I party and sleep til noon, what every day people do<br/>
Give me a week or two<br/>
See when you read the news my bitches don't sleep till noon<br/>
My rhyme time is why, my album is fly<br/>
Your favorite record, you gonna put it aside<br/>
This that old school shit soundin’ good in the ride<br/>
And fuck ten I’m only countin’ to nine<br/>
Said this that old school shit, soundin’ good in the ride<br/>
Said let’s head out to the party I’ll drive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
What’s goin’ on? There’s a party<br/>
Hope the neighbors don’t mind us gettin’ loud<br/>
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right<br/>
We came to get down, we gonna do that now<br/>
<br/>
My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on<br/>
My light up shoes on<br/>
They love the way my kicks flash<br/>
This ain’t a time to just sit back<br/>
Cause, there’s a party on 5th ave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
