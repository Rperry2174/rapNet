<i>[Intro: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Might as well introduce<br/>
This is madness!<br/>
This is an outrage<br/>
As a matter of fact, this is outrageous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Yeah, young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer<br/>
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina<br/>
Like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted<br/>
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious, baby go on<br/>
Take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesus<br/>
Batting practice with the motherfucking ghost of Babe Ruth<br/>
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful<br/>
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail<br/>
<i>[Coughing]</i> Right there<br/>
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target<br/>
Then I don't know why I even started<br/>
I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light<br/>
Told myself, "Fuck the world kid, just do what you like"<br/>
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life<br/>
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity<br/>
But all those big words ain't gonna get you paid<br/>
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid<br/>
You got it made in that mad house<br/>
What the fuck you got to be sad about? Go ahead and rap now<br/>
Do what you do best, I mean<br/>
That's what you do best, matter fact motherfucker<br/>
You suit vest, you need to buy a new dress<br/>
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex<br/>
I'ma put her ass in a Suplex, the sun east, the moon west<br/>
You got a clue, what does a clue get?<br/>
Nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]</i><br/>
My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore<br/>
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway<br/>
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow<br/>
And the lion through the forest<br/>
To the wicked witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay<br/>
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard<br/>
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard<br/>
Now the whole world's in color, still,<br/>
How Auntie Em was next of kin and not her mother<br/>
Real, her face was care-worn<br/>
I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn<br/>
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginning of Year One<br/>
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic<br/>
The poetry's like the poems and songs of Ecclesiastes<br/>
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet<br/>
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet<br/>
And yell "Hear, hear", finally some order to this rap shit<br/>
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips<br/>
I keep my shit crispy and elegant,<br/>
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent<br/>
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford<br/>
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal<br/>
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca<br/>
Shout out to Tony Toca, we livin' how we supposed to...
