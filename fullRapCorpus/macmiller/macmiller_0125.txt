<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods<br/>
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads<br/>
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice<br/>
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket<br/>
Woah, think it's time for a revolution<br/>
Me and my dawgs 'bout to start a riot<br/>
You still there sleeping, bet I'm eating<br/>
You and your people are on a diet<br/>
Tim Allen off Home Improvement<br/>
Intelligent but we going stupid<br/>
This some new shit<br/>
Hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with<br/>
Out in London like Lennox Lewis<br/>
Bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett<br/>
I'm just tryna make better music<br/>
Get this money, share the profits<br/>
Now this class getting led by students<br/>
Smoke some weed, get head while I do it<br/>
Started out under the ground<br/>
They didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around<br/>
Money I'm hunting it down<br/>
Planting the seeds<br/>
Working and watching it grow<br/>
I got so many ways I can make money, I'll always be straight<br/>
I just thought you should know<br/>
Been on my grind, taking what's mine<br/>
I got my eyes on the throne<br/>
I'ma be fine, no matter the time<br/>
We all go along with the show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
That girl beautiful, somebody introduce me<br/>
She ain't your girl tonight, nah, that bitch a groupie<br/>
That's money in my building better give it to me<br/>
I see you starin' at me like you in the movies<br/>
Now you watching movies<br/>
Y'all are looking at my life it's like you watching movies<br/>
Looking at my life is like you watching movies<br/>
Y'all are looking at my life is like you watching movies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with gods<br/>
Hoes is on my disciples, you get mind-fucked by these broads<br/>
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice<br/>
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket<br/>
Woah, fuck a day job, fuck a day job<br/>
Gotcha bitch here in just a tank top<br/>
Gettin' paid, blow my face off<br/>
Bitch you're bank fraud, Bernie Madoff<br/>
Educate y'all<br/>
Then erase y'all<br/>
LL Cool J without the Kangol<br/>
I don't see the need to stunt<br/>
Wish you the best, I'ma just light up this blunt<br/>
This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't<br/>
Say my D could win the Heisman, yeah I'm Charles Woodson<br/>
Couple million off a tour, that's a lot of bookings<br/>
My bitches gorgeous looking imported from the shore of Brooklyn<br/>
Coming from out of the 'Burgh<br/>
Bitch, I'm absurd<br/>
Fuck you, I hope you insured<br/>
Hatin'? I'll give you just what you deserve, that's my word<br/>
Put it on all that I'm worth<br/>
Been on my grind, taking what's mine<br/>
I got my eyes on the throne<br/>
I'ma be fine, no matter the time<br/>
We all go along with the show<br/>
<br/>

Now you watching movies<br/>
Y'all are looking at my life it's like you watching movies<br/>
Looking at my life is like you watching movies<br/>
Y'all are looking at my life is like you watching movies
