<br/>
You hide your skin like you're shy or there's something wrong<br/>
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah<br/>
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs<br/>
So finally I made a fuckin' song<br/>
And now she comin' closer<br/>
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones<br/>
You want it don't ya?<br/>
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over<br/>
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break<br/>
You need to smell your sweet aroma<br/>
See I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips<br/>
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix<br/>
My dick on business trips<br/>
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit<br/>
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river<br/>
In the Caribbean<br/>
<br/>
It's okay that you like it babe (I like it baby)<br/>
And it's alright that you misbehave<br/>
It's okay to be this way (this way)<br/>
To live this way baby baby (ooh baby)<br/>
Chillin' with the AC<br/>
<br/>
That's just the way that we are<br/>
You and me, super freaks here we are<br/>
I'm takin' care of each and every part<br/>
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart<br/>
<br/>
Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine yeah, too divine<br/>
Who am I? Well, I'm Mr. Superfly<br/>
I'm Mr. Blew your, blew your mind, hot as June, July<br/>
I wanna make you waterfall<br/>
Girl you my painting, you my art installation<br/>
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall<br/>
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on<br/>
Why would I ever blow you off?<br/>
Right now, let's go get lost<br/>
Just I've been way too hot for way too long<br/>
I'm so exhausted<br/>
Whether that's your mind or line we still get crossed<br/>
First your name is gone<br/>
Never understand until you have to stand alone<br/>
Can I have a hand to hold?<br/>
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold<br/>
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand you so<br/>
They didn't want a man when it was; man I'm broke<br/>
But now they know me and what I don't need<br/>
No Six, no Beamers, no Benz<br/>
<br/>
That's just the way that we are<br/>
You and me, super freaks here we are<br/>
I'm takin' care of each and every part<br/>
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart<br/>
<br/>
These hoes<br/>
These hoes<br/>
Taste this, taste, taste this<br/>
These hoes<br/>
Taste this, taste, taste this<br/>
These hoes
