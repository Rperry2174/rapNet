<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Uh, lemme get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination<br/>
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station<br/>
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back<br/>
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna to relax<br/>
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon<br/>
I got an army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan<br/>
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on<br/>
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long<br/>
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?<br/>
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen<br/>
Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me<br/>
Well, I made it big and, everybody phony<br/>
Haha, so could you pour me, I need a cup<br/>
No, none of that liquor, mixin' purple stuff<br/>
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much<br/>
Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality<br/>
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony<br/>
Looking at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine<br/>
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?<br/>
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality<br/>
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony<br/>
Looking at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine<br/>
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?<br/>
What the, what the fuck is time?<br/>
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (I don't know)<br/>
What the fuck is time?<br/>
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
What do you do when you think you could be a icon?<br/>
Because all these people get to screamin' with the lights on<br/>
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat<br/>
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone<br/>
And now these writers taking shots without a Nikon<br/>
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo<br/>
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though<br/>
Potion in my sprite, then my night slows down, down<br/>
See, that's exactly what I need<br/>
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat<br/>
Like it was "Donald Trump", a fuckin hit but I just call it luck<br/>
They throw it on when I'm walking in the club<br/>
Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this<br/>
Well, I don't think you lookin' for me on the surface<br/>
Learn quick, now I'm big time<br/>
Fill your cup up, and I'm a sip mine<br/>
<br/>
