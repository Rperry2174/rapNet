Yeah, yeah<br/>
Let me get a little bit more beat<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Ask god if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity<br/>
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free<br/>
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave<br/>
I took a nap, I need a tree in the shade<br/>
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass<br/>
Picturing the images that make you laugh<br/>
I left you out to die but will you take me back<br/>
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious<br/>
She's naked underneath them shadows, let the sunlight undress her slow<br/>
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doing impressions though<br/>
I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go<br/>
I wake up, pop a couple Benadrylls, go back to sleep<br/>
So I made up, everything they said was real, it has to be<br/>
Cause actually the master fast asleep<br/>
And the castles back back in his private quarters<br/>
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order<br/>
All this torture, thought I had to warn you<br/>
Leave it all behind and go to California<br/>
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzing this feeling<br/>
You can't fathom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Little Dragon:]</i><br/>
My hands are ahead the clouds<br/>
From the clap-clap thunder looking down<br/>
While you're running around<br/>
I lift you up when you drown<br/>
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation<br/>
Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead<br/>
You're always running ahead<br/>
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances<br/>
And you paddle like a duckling, why<br/>
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival<br/>
You got angels, we can see them dripping from the sky<br/>
You watch 'em with your third eye<br/>
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival<br/>
To the festival<br/>
<br/>
Hola, Malcolm. Hey man, it's Lois man. I'm calling, man, to tell you about the album.<br/>
I listened, it's good. I need to tell you, man. I tell everyone to listen to the music and it sound like they like it, man.<br/>
It sound like it good. I tell my wife "I'm so proud of him." I tell my girlfriend "I'm so proud of him."<br/>
And the album is good. It's so good. I cannot believe it. No one can beat you
