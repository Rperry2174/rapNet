Can you turn the beat up? A little louder... There ya go.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Some people (oh whoa-oh-oh)<br/>
Whoa-oh-oh (uhn-nuh-unh-nuh)<br/>
Yea, people say, people-oh-oh (people-oh-oh)<br/>
Say...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
People love you when they on your mind<br/>
A thought is love's currency<br/>
And I been thinking about her all the time<br/>
I never seen somebody put together perfectly<br/>
What would I have to do to call you mine?<br/>
Someone like you is so hard to find<br/>
You can open up your eyes or you can walk in blind<br/>
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry<br/>
Listen to me, I'ma set you free<br/>
He ain't gonna break your heart again<br/>
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy<br/>
When your imagination's on pretend<br/>
I never thought that it would feel this way<br/>
You never taught me how to heal the pain<br/>
I wish you caught me on a different day<br/>
When it was easier to be happy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So just a little taste and you know she got you<br/>
Can you hide away, can you hide away?<br/>
The sound of silence as they all just watch you<br/>
I kinda find it strange<br/>
How the times have changed<br/>
But I wish, we could go and be free, once<br/>
Baby, you and me<br/>
We could change the world forever<br/>
And never come back again<br/>
Let's leave it all in the rear-view<br/>
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl<br/>
You don't have to cry<br/>
You don't have to cry<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to cry no more<br/>
You don't have to cry no more<br/>
You don't have to cry no more, little girl<br/>
You don't have to cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Mend a broken heart girl if you can<br/>
I don't expect you to be capable<br/>
You got the world right in your hands<br/>
And that responsibility is inescapable<br/>
I promise that I'll be a different man<br/>
Please give me the chance to go and live again<br/>
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?<br/>
It seems perfection really is so unobtainable<br/>
Don't even say you about to end it all<br/>
Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself<br/>
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all<br/>
I wish the truth would just reveal itself<br/>
Who do you call to make it to the top?<br/>
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?<br/>
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?<br/>
After everything I did I think I'm still myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So just a little taste and you know she got you<br/>
Can you hide away, can you hide away?<br/>
The sound of silence as they all just watch you<br/>
I kinda find it strange<br/>
How the times have changed<br/>
But I wish, we could go and be free, once<br/>
Baby, you and me<br/>
We could change the world forever<br/>
And never come back again<br/>
Let's leave it all in the rear-view<br/>
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl<br/>
Oh-oh-oh<br/>
Let's leave it all in the rear-view<br/>
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh<br/>
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl<br/>
You don't have to cry<br/>
You don't have to cry<br/>
Whoa-oh-oh (yeah)<br/>
Let's leave it all in the rear-view<br/>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh<br/>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
