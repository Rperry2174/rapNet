DJ Capcom is about to fuck up hip-hop with this joint,<br/>
So all you haters out there,<br/>
Get back.<br/>
<br/>
This is a DJ Haze exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2)]</i><br/>
Aye yo Mac, what it is?<br/>
We wanna know what you sound like kid.<br/>
So whatchu sound like?<br/>
Who you sound like?<br/>
How you sound like?<br/>
Why you sound like that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I sound like old, (what?)<br/>
I sound like new, (uh-huh)<br/>
I sound like me,<br/>
And I sound like you.<br/>
I sound like yes,<br/>
I sound like fresh, (fresh)<br/>
I sound like a bird first flyin' out the nest. (ah-hah!)<br/>
I sound like rap,<br/>
I sound like rock,<br/>
I sound like every single type of hip-hop.<br/>
I sound like pain,<br/>
&amp; I sound like fame,<br/>
I sound like water,<br/>
&amp; I sound like flames.<br/>
I sound like cash,<br/>
You sound like change, (cha-ching!)<br/>
I sound like style, <br/>
&amp; I sound like bang.<br/>
Sound like trash,<br/>
Sound like ecstasy,<br/>
Sound like a harmony on a melody.<br/>
To determine what I sound like,<br/>
Please come listen. <br/>
This ain't no ordinary white boy spittin'. (boy spittin'!)<br/>
Mac Miller, <br/>
He'd a give you sound bytes, (what?)<br/>
So why do people wanna know what I sound like?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I sound like death,<br/>
I sound like life,<br/>
Cause good things don't come around twice. (uh-huh)<br/>
I sound like feathers,<br/>
And I sound like steel. (Yup)<br/>
Yeah, I sound like real,<br/>
I sound like the next dude up to get a deal, (Thas' me!)<br/>
Sound like I'm hungry; never had a meal.<br/>
I sound like heaven,<br/>
I sound like hell,<br/>
And it sound a lot better than it smell. (ah-hah!)<br/>
And it taste a lot better than it look like,<br/>
So, I'ma make sure it cook right.<br/>
It sound like Diddy vs. Suge Knight,<br/>
Sound like <i>[?]</i>.<br/>
Sound like the suburbs,<br/>
Sound like the streets. (Yup)<br/>
Sound like a bomb,<br/>
Sound like boom!<br/>
Sound like a kid writing raps in his room.<br/>
Don't sound like your everyday rap cat spittin'<br/>
You wanna know what I sound like? Listen.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
These motherfuckers know how I sound.<br/>
I sound like fresh.<br/>
I sound like the new.<br/>
I sound like the motherfucking future.<br/>
So if you ain't listenin',<br/>
Don't ask what I sound like.<br/>
But if you know, <br/>
Then you closer to the future.<br/>
Mac Miller.<br/>
Eastern Empire.<br/>
