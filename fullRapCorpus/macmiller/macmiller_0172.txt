<i>[Lil B:]</i><br/>
Time flies, time flies. As we keep living and as we keep being positive, all we can do is hold onto these memories.<br/>
Mac Miller, I love you<br/>
<br/>
All of my homies used to get on my case like "when you gonna kill 'em?"<br/>
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children<br/>
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims<br/>
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons<br/>
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though<br/>
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these Nymphos?<br/>
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?<br/>
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest<br/>
I'm an honest man, my mama told me never put it on the lotto and<br/>
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam<br/>
So when I die, these bitches can still can fuck my hologram, god... damn...<br/>
<br/>
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high<br/>
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride<br/>
I got 'em worried that my mind fried<br/>
I'm goin' up before I skydive<br/>
<br/>
You can see the way that time flies<br/>
Time files, try to catch it<br/>
Time flies, time flies<br/>
Try to catch it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil B:]</i><br/>
Watch as time go, time moves, time flows. How do we handle these things?<br/>
I am time, we are time and we have control. One thing we need to remember is that we are all in this together<br/>
<br/>
You can expect the unexpected<br/>
These dreams are manifested from my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive, but...<br/>
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings<br/>
All the times that I've been reckless, with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' "I'm the man"<br/>
I never let these hoes into the plan<br/>
My room for bullshit in the clear as small as a child's hands<br/>
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand<br/>
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah<br/>
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road<br/>
Even thought I know they need my at home<br/>
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold<br/>
East to that own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone<br/>
<br/>
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high<br/>
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride<br/>
I got 'em worried that my mind fried<br/>
I'm goin' up before I skydive<br/>
<br/>
You can see the way that time flies<br/>
Time files, try to catch it<br/>
Time flies, time flies<br/>
Try to catch it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil B:]</i><br/>
One day we will, we will find, we will concur, concur with love, while time is one our side.<br/>
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories. They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on, Lil B
