<i>[October London:]</i><br/>
As we go on... (We go on)<br/>
Like we do... (Like we do)<br/>
When it's hot outside... (Hot outside)<br/>
I just wanna chill with you... (Chill with you)<br/>
What you need? (What you need?)<br/>
Is put ya mind at ease... (Mind at ease)<br/>
Here's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze<br/>
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do<br/>
Let's smoke and ride...<br/>
Baby if you feel the same, let me know<br/>
(If you feel the same, then let me know)<br/>
I wanna rock ya, girl... (Oh!)<br/>
Yes I do!<br/>
What you got to lose?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
You done made it to see a whole 'nother summer and it feel good<br/>
Stop, now, top down through the neighborhood<br/>
Let the wind blow, open up the window<br/>
That girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe<br/>
We have a barbeque to do at four<br/>
Swimming pool party in the back on the low<br/>
BYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free<br/>
Little kids get down, I'll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown<br/>
Now do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work<br/>
And do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt<br/>
Playing mama dear, calm and clear<br/>
This that time of the year<br/>
For everybody to be boisterous<br/>
Rock with Snoop Dogg and rejoice to this<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Shined up my white walls, night falls<br/>
I'm feeling hella good<br/>
I'm doin thangs that you never would<br/>
Like surfin with the sharks, or shootin in the dark<br/>
Riding on a bike with my grandson at the park<br/>
Evolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate<br/>
Breakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter<br/>
Finna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion<br/>
I'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars<br/>
Neighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard<br/>
We go, till we can't go no more<br/>
It's me and mines, it's summertime<br/>
You go off and we go on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[October London:]</i><br/>
As we go on... (We go on)<br/>
Like we do... (Like we do)<br/>
When it's hot outside... (Hot outside)<br/>
I just wanna chill with you... (Chill with you)<br/>
What you need? (What you need?)<br/>
Is put ya mind at ease... (Mind at ease)<br/>
Here's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze<br/>
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do<br/>
Let's smoke and ride...<br/>
Baby if you feel the same, let me know<br/>
(If you feel the same, then let me know)<br/>
I wanna rock ya, girl... (Oh!)<br/>
Yes I do!<br/>
What you got to lose?
