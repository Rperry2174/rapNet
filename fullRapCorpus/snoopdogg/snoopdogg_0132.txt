<i>[50 talkin:]</i> It's 50 Cent &amp; S-N-double O-P<br/>
You don't want no snoop &amp; you don't want it wit me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (50 cent):]</i><br/>
Everytime I come around they like "Oh No"<br/>
I get to trippin; slap the clip up in my 44<br/>
Shit I been thru in my hood made my heart cold<br/>
I get to poppin off that thang like I'm loco<br/>
No sense in coppin pleas when you see my knife out (knife out)<br/>
Motherfuckers light out (lights out)<br/>
<br/>
Here comes Snoop, uh (oh shit) (Oh No)<br/>
Sup Nigga, sup now, huh? (Oh No)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop:]</i><br/>
Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol<br/>
Courdoroy khakis, stacies &amp; brimmed up<br/>
Straight razors just to keep you trimmed up<br/>
1-8-7, oh yeah, now you remember<br/>
He's electrifyin &amp; original<br/>
So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal<br/>
The one you hate to love, in the club, in the cut<br/>
Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit<br/>
You betta check dat ho, that's what wreckin G<br/>
Now step your game down, cause ain't no checkin me<br/>
You'll be respectin me until you leave this room<br/>
Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom<br/>
Now your names on a tomb<br/>
They pourin out liqour wit no room to consume, you silly bafoon<br/>
I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin em<br/>
Walkin in my big blue chucks cause I'm killin em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talkin:]</i> Hey whaddup cuz, it's 50 cent;<br/>
What's happnin nigga?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent:]</i><br/>
Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin (Yea)<br/>
Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye... an<br/>
He who fears fate lives like a coward<br/>
You go against me, you'll be devoured<br/>
Then you get to poppin you'll have a change of heart<br/>
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart<br/>
Have doc usin donors, dead niggas with spare parts<br/>
You come back wit lungs of a snitch, an the heart of a dead nark<br/>
Niggas never see the light till it spark<br/>
Then they bleed, it get cold, then shit get dark<br/>
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets<br/>
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me<br/>
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits<br/>
Push Me - a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin<br/>
Your services are no longer needed; Rock-a-bye baby<br/>
My bitch'll do it to you with a lil 380 (Yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I'm bailin thru the door again<br/>
Let the Momo pour again<br/>
Me &amp; my ho again<br/>
Yea she got the four up in this motherfucker<br/>
And Imma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka duck us<br/>
It'll crack off, Now back off - real slow<br/>
An if you don't know, I never hesitate to shoot a ho<br/>
Yea that's my reputation - you test my patience &amp;<br/>
You &amp; your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam<br/>
Goddammit I'm at it again<br/>
They done let that bitch nigga up outta the pen<br/>
And now he lookin for me - what the heck - my game is built on respect<br/>
Now I'm breathin down your mortherfuckin neck<br/>
I dumps till my clips is empty<br/>
I'm headin down Willshire to San Vicente<br/>
And when I get there don't ask who sent me<br/>
Just take dem shots an drop it like it's hot<br/>
Bitch Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talkin:]</i><br/>
Ha-ha-ha<br/>
Yea Nigga<br/>
Just when you thought I was gone<br/>
Slide back up on you like the wind nigga<br/>
Hurricane D-O-Double G<br/>
With the G,G,G,G,G, G-unit
