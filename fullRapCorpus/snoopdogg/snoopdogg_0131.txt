<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Boy Boy Boy<br/>
You know that you got me Snoop<br/>

Now hang up your coat<br/>

You ever seen a stretch Li Jet two seater (No)<br/>
It aint what you want it's what you need<br/>
A real ass nigga to help you kick your feet up (Yea)<br/>
Now flip your channel to Lifetime<br/>
You stay on my mind even when I'm writing rhymes<br/>
We can chill all day until the nightime<br/>
I'll let you know when to go at the right time<br/>
