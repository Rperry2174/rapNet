Yea wassup baby girl<br/>
I'm just looking over this homework<br/>
I really need some help<br/>
You wanna study with me?<br/>
That'd be nice, yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?<br/>
and help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with<br/>
honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with<br/>
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street<br/>
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Honeydew, money do<br/>
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh<br/>
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed<br/>
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet<br/>
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind<br/>
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it<br/>
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?<br/>
and help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with<br/>
honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with<br/>
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street<br/>
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, put me on the game<br/>
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame<br/>
Usually kinda square, I'm trying to use it for a change<br/>
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gon need a lot of brains<br/>
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?<br/>
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall<br/>
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on<br/>
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?<br/>
and help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with<br/>
honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with<br/>
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street<br/>
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Devin there you are, look at my repertoire<br/>
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard<br/>
Change that perspective, that's my objective<br/>
Cool and oh so collective, connected<br/>
Check this, I need you more that you could know<br/>
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow<br/>
Let it go, let me know where to meet at<br/>
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?<br/>
and help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with<br/>
honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with<br/>
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street<br/>
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that<br/>
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at<br/>
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that<br/>
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?<br/>
and help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with<br/>
honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with<br/>
5 days out the week, my stay's out the street<br/>
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet
