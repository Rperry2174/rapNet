Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit<br/>
Check this out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Nigga 20 dollars to my name<br/>
Deep in this dice game<br/>
I dust off my knees<br/>
I fucked off two g's<br/>
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock<br/>
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot<br/>
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind<br/>
Shit I'm  tyring to get mine<br/>
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline<br/>
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes<br/>
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo<br/>
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out<br/>
And get you gun out<br/>
And shoot'em up till they come out<br/>
I'm blowing in the wind<br/>
It feels good my friend<br/>
Silkk brought the Gin &amp; Juice and my nigga chipped in<br/>
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc<br/>
A drug dealer at the same time i love to smoke<br/>
But if I wasn't in this rap game<br/>
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus  Fiend]</i><br/>
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs<br/>
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs<br/>
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed<br/>
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed  repeat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fiend]</i><br/>
I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?<br/>
With this automatic rocket<br/>
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage<br/>
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch<br/>
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips<br/>
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this<br/>
Cold blooded killing for ??? this<br/>
Soda couldn't rock this<br/>
chop a shelf when i drop this<br/>
My ??? can't chop this<br/>
The hunger that I hold<br/>
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul<br/>
See this here with a hole<br/>
Allowed that silencer to blow<br/>
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soulja Slim]</i><br/>
Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja<br/>
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober<br/>
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back<br/>
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac<br/>
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin<br/>
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin<br/>
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time<br/>
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???<br/>
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got<br/>
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being <br/>
shot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Silkk the Shocker]</i><br/>
Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside<br/>
I had 120 dollars, but i spent a 100 on my ride<br/>
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name<br/>
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine<br/>
I told him weed charge it 2 the game<br/>
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit<br/>
Some slum shit<br/>
Some out the projects dumb shit<br/>
some weed and blunt shit<br/>
Some I don't give a fuck shit, where it from shit<br/>
Some penitentiary solitary confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun <br/>
shit<br/>
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more<br/>
So I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick <br/>
door<br/>
Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting<br/>
Y'all call me down??? do get scared I ain't flipped till my guns smoking<br/>
It be a hustle just to eat  <br/>
And it be hard on these streets<br/>
Gotta get my hustle on<br/>
Got 20 dollars y'all now that shit don't last long  picture this
