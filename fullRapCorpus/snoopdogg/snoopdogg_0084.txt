<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Man, you got me goin crazy baby<br/>
Feel like I'm losin my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Soopafly]</i><br/>
Feels like I'm losin control, and I don't even know<br/>
Girl you hurt me oh so bad cause I love you so, hey<br/>
But it don't matter now, I'm doin better now<br/>
Whatever you do, bitch, will come back to you, bitch<br/>
Heeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey<br/>
Heeeeeeeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly * overlapping chorus]</i><br/>
I was in love at times<br/>
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes<br/>
I was in love at times<br/>
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes<br/>
Now who would ever think that I wanted a home<br/>
Three kids and a wife, never be alone<br/>
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence<br/>
Havin somethin on the side?  It didn't make sense<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Butch]</i> I'm a family man sportin a weddin band<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn<br/>
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you<br/>
The other twenty was cool, cause we gon' make it through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Butch]</i> The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker, <br/>
"Don't worry about what the FUCK I be doin'"<br/>
We was makin chemistry, but who is he?<br/>
And how dis nigga know the deal about you and me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Butch]</i> I fell to my knees and asked the girl "Why?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
She looked at my eyes with no reply<br/>
So I cried, I was in love at times<br/>
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg * overlapping chorus]</i><br/>
I was in love at times<br/>
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes<br/>
I was in love at times<br/>
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes<br/>
I was in love at times<br/>
They say "Game Don't Wait" huh Warren G?<br/>
Well the game better wait for me<br/>
I'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes<br/>
In the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime<br/>
Got me losin my mind<br/>
Well if lovin you is a crime<br/>
I'm down to do my time<br/>
Lock me up and throw away the key<br/>
I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be"<br/>
I see you with me forever<br/>
We can do things that you never, thought you coulda<br/>
Up out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you<br/>
I can't believe that you shook to another spot<br/>
And left me cold, now I'm hot<br/>
I'm tryin to find you, what am I to do?<br/>
I gave you everything that you needed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop * over chorus]</i><br/>
Took it for granted, shit, I'm cool now<br/>
What goes around, comes around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> I was in love at times<br/>
<i>[Soopa]</i> I was in love at times<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> I was in love at times<br/>
<i>[Soopa]</i> I was in love at times<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You know what girl I mean..<br/>
I was in love with you and you did me like that<br/>
But you know what they say?<br/>
What goes around comes around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Butch Cassidy]</i><br/>
How could, how could, you do me wrong?<br/>
You be messin up my songs (my songs)<br/>
Now a nigga must move on (I gave you)<br/>
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me (on me)<br/>
Had a nigga sick for weeks (for weeks)<br/>
Now I must begin my streak (I was in love at times..)<br/>
<br/>
