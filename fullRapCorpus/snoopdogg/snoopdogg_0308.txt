<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Let me be the man and get the money<br/>
Baby how that sound?<br/>
When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin<br/>
When I'm feelin' low I'm on some brown<br/>
Won't you come straight to California<br/>
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down<br/>
Know around the world get nasty<br/>
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be<br/>
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
That's where the cash be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Mula, fetty, you not ready<br/>
I'm a get the cheese but the bread was spaghetti<br/>
Letti said he can play with them broads<br/>
Opportunistic I stay on them hoes<br/>
I ain't got time to be handing with y'all<br/>
'Specially when there is no money involved<br/>
<br/>
Joint seem mighty long<br/>
Red beam on his dome<br/>
Point seen money gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Let me be the man and get the money<br/>
Baby how that sound?<br/>
When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin<br/>
When I'm feelin' low I'm on some brown<br/>
Won't you come straight to California<br/>
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down<br/>
Know around the world get nasty<br/>
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be<br/>
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Robert De Niro, fly as a sparrow<br/>
Profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh<br/>
El Bueno, hustle like Maino<br/>
All money in, no draino<br/>
Cato, body, get it like I get mines<br/>
Smoke papers, Jamaica, I make it, bake it, shake it, or make it<br/>
Never had to fake it to make it<br/>
Just put the pedal to the metal rock it up to get flakey<br/>
I'm living the fast life<br/>
Jet after jet and try to keep my cash right<br/>
I know you understand the meaning<br/>
Hand full of green and while the fans keep feigning<br/>
Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at<br/>
Or even in the hood where the crips at<br/>
<br/>
Joint seem mighty long<br/>
Red beam on his dome<br/>
Point seen money gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>

Won't you come straight to California<br/>
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down<br/>
Know around the world get nasty<br/>
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be<br/>
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
That's where the cash be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
All right now I need passion to the stage<br/>
Destiny, Melia, Passion<br/>
I need y'all to the stage let's go<br/>
I need y'all on the stage let's go<br/>
Work, work, work<br/>
<br/>
In a white ghost sipping holy water<br/>
Always been the type to get it close to porters<br/>
After play, Barry Bonds, out the park, I got hits<br/>
What you mean? I through the tarp<br/>
At the wall, off the wall<br/>
I feel like Mike, I don't miss<br/>
Niggas talkin' shit<br/>
Saying I didn't fuck that pussy into one-nighty<br/>
HItting that pussy quit was just aight, uhh<br/>
Not at all I ain't get to see the wall<br/>
I cocked 'em off, fuck them all<br/>
Fuck the law, fuck you thought<br/>
I ain't change, seen my chain looks like the car<br/>
Flashy man, flashy this and dancing on me<br/>
Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup<br/>
Lemonade to niggas that be acting tough<br/>
See you got money I just double up<br/>
Multiply, fuck addition, fuck your position<br/>
Macauley Culkin, rich and riches<br/>
This the life, then walk away it's so delicious<br/>
Up in Dubai, Sushi hella bitches<br/>
Aw man wrote a check, 2 commas, lean lean<br/>
Tell em' I need two shots, or two o' clock<br/>
Plus that adds about 2000, teardrops<br/>
Pull up with my crew in silent nights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
I need a girl who will do whatever I want<br/>
I need a girl who will do whatever I want
