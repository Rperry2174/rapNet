<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yo, this next record right here, is a dedication<br/>
This dedicated to those, who've come to an end<br/>
Quit like Gladys Knight... <br/>
You know neither one of us wants<br/>
to be the first one to say goodbye<br/>
So, hopefully this record will help you<br/>
Get to the conclusion, ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
I love this girl but I don't know about her<br/>
.As a matter of fact, I could go without her<br/>
But she got my daughter, I don't know why I bother<br/>
to try to make it work when she make it so harder<br/>
Wake up and break up and do the same thing tomorrow<br/>
I get tired of fightin', I feel no sorrow<br/>
for you, to keep it movin' in that Monte Carlo<br/>
That's what I get for fuckin' with a video model<br/>

<i>[Raphael Saadiq]</i><br/>
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You don't love me, you just love my Doggystyle<br/>
I used to put it on yo' ass, you ain't had it in a while<br/>
Instead of crackin' smiles, you'd rather cramp a nigga style<br/>
You act too wild, I won't walk you down the aisle<br/>
What you thought? Yeah, we could chill, we could talk<br/>
When I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks<br/>
So it's, best we go our seperate ways and stay apart<br/>
No more me and you boo, I done had a change of heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raphael Saadiq]</i><br/>
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you<br/>
But I'm not in love with you<br/>
(I'm just not in love with you baby)<br/>
I'm not sayin' I don't got love for you<br/>
But I'm not in love with you<br/>
And feels like such a... <br/>
<br/>
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
Waste of time, waste of time, waste of time<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright<br/>
Go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Sorry it had to end this way<br/>
But uh, it is what it is<br/>
I'm alright, don't worry about me<br/>
I'm cool, ha ha, yeah<br/>
You go your way and I'll go mine<br/>
Real talk, I'm cool, I ain't even trippin'<br/>
I'ma roll out with Raphael<br/>
Yeah, fo sho, I'ma roll with him<br/>
I'm cool, you go your way, I go mine<br/>

See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
