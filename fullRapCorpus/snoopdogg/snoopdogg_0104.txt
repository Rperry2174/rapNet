<i>[Latoiya Williams]</i><br/>
I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you<br/>
This love's exactly how I picture... (how I picture)<br/>
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you<br/>
We're flowing smooth just like a river... (like a river)<br/>
Express my true<br/>
When, I make love to you... (to you)<br/>
Just like that day back in September<br/>
If we might run in some problems<br/>
I know you'll see me through<br/>
There's nothing for you I wont do<br/>
Cause I believe in you... (you)<br/>
Oh I believe in you... (you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
And I believe in you too<br/>
See can't nobody make me do what you do<br/>
I mean I'm so in love with you... (boo)<br/>
I never thought a girl could make me<br/>
Take me<br/>
To a whole new world<br/>
Re-shape me, love me, hate me<br/>
Lately<br/>
We ain't been fussing or fighting<br/>
You play all day and I be working at night and<br/>
The only one who understands my life and<br/>
The cake and the icing<br/>
These other girls<br/>
In the world<br/>
Live their life so trifling<br/>
I couldn't do it no more<br/>
I had to sit you down<br/>
And make you my wife and... (yaa)<br/>
Cold thing<br/>
But you know<br/>
It's a cold gain... (goal gain)<br/>
It's so real<br/>
I had to bless you with my last name... (last name)<br/>
Slowed me down<br/>
Straight took me out the fast lane... (fast lane)<br/>
Hold me down<br/>
Come on baby<br/>
Watch me do this thing... (do it)<br/>
I been crowned king<br/>
So I guess that means you're my queen<br/>
You have my seeds<br/>
Lets go ahead and raise this team<br/>
It's so special<br/>
You're all I ever need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Latoiya Williams]</i><br/>
I'm feeling good and my baby's home<br/>
You're spending time<br/>
Holding hands<br/>
To this beat<br/>
The fellow that can satisfy my every need<br/>
Is he the one?<br/>
We've been around and we're both grown... (grown)<br/>
Look at me... (me)<br/>
I'm like a baby<br/>
I took that chance<br/>
And I feel secure about this love romance<br/>
Let's have some fun<br/>
And I believe when you say<br/>
Ain't that special... (oh)<br/>
Touch my soul... (soul)<br/>
Feel the same<br/>
When you whisper softly<br/>
And call my name<br/>
Here I come<br/>
It's more than words that I ever could sing<br/>
You're that chill bring<br/>
Maybe your walk or just the way you do me<br/>
I really think we are the two<br/>
Cause I believe in you<br/>
Take a second realize we can make it if you<br/>
Don't stop<br/>
Come on boy we about to take it<br/>
To the top<br/>
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see<br/>
Do you believe in me?<br/>
We can make it all nite long<br/>
Baby if we<br/>
Don't stop<br/>
Come on boy you know you got me<br/>
So hot<br/>
I know I'm gonna love what you're about to do<br/>
Cause I believe in you<br/>
I believe in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
And I believe in you too<br/>
Cause its the right thing to do<br/>
And I believe in you too<br/>
Cause its the only thing to do<br/>
I couldn't give you away<br/>
No matter what my friends sizzay<br/>
See when I'm gone<br/>
Away from home<br/>
I'm alone every dizzay<br/>
I left a gang of messages for you<br/>
On your two way<br/>
But you ain't hollered back<br/>
But you know how, you play<br/>
You say, ok<br/>
I say, no way<br/>
We got to be together forever<br/>
And a dizzay<br/>
Cause I believe in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Latoiya Williams]</i><br/>
