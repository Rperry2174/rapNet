Say baby girl<br/>
Why don't you light some candles and put somethin' on for a nigga though? Forreal<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
<br/>
Yes I'm the most high<br/>
Baby want it, Mimosa<br/>
I tried to reverse her, a mentirosa<br/>
Gov me livin' the vida loca in Acapulco<br/>
With my pictures on the wall on a poster, a roller coaster<br/>
So I try to dance my life away to get it over<br/>
I'm sippin' Jamison with famous friends until I'm sober<br/>
Don't wanna go home, I know I'm gonna get into a fight<br/>
I called my sidepiece and tell her I'mma spend the night<br/>
And if she out of town, baby we' gon' book a flight<br/>
She got it laid out with incense and candlelights<br/>
Your shit's on hit, officially lit<br/>
You're tryna get a nigga sprung, your pussy wet, you lil bit<br/>
You have no idea, what? You want me right here?<br/>
Are you sure that we can do this shit right here?<br/>
Cause if it's on like that, I'll spend the night here<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
<br/>
Good love, good sex and good weed<br/>
Baby oil to rub down my sleeves, relax and breathe<br/>
Red wine, crackers and cheese, baby shootin' the breeze<br/>
While aiming to please<br/>
Oh please, don't stop with the antics<br/>
High heels, t-shirts, no panties<br/>
Me knockin', she's rockin' the boat<br/>
While baking me a cake with a root beer float<br/>
Then put the TV on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports<br/>
Every room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke<br/>
Got keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary<br/>
Mary, Mary, Quite Crip Contrary<br/>
Apartment contemporary<br/>
Jo Malone candles, very airy<br/>
Ain't that right Siri? (That's right Siri)<br/>
So keep sendin' that right<br/>
The way it's lookin', I'll be spendin' the night<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
You don't have to leave<br/>
You can stay at my house, I aims to please<br/>
Just relax and breathe<br/>
You deserve attention, I'm what you need<br/>
<br/>
I'm on my way, yeah<br/>
Just leave the backdoor open<br/>
I'm pullin' up right now<br/>
And I'mma spend the night<br/>
Fo' sho'
