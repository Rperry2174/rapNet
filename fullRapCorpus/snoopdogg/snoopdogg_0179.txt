<i>[Chorus (Charlie Wilson):]</i><br/>
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family<br/>
Fighting these precious in my life<br/>
I know my mind should be on shining and getting Grammies<br/>
But these streets won't say a goodbye<br/>
<br/>
I can't say goodbye<br/>
To the blocks<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the hood<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the streets (to my problems)<br/>
I can't say goodbye<br/>
To the hood<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the blocks<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the streets<br/>
I can't say goodbye goodbye<br/>
To the blocks<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the streets<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the hood<br/>
I can't say goodbye<br/>
To the hood<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the blocks<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
To the homies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE - SNOOP DOGG]</i><br/>
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy<br/>
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy<br/>
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy<br/>
They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy,<br/>
Let them do them take care of your own boy"<br/>
But I said back brake a bound, before I was drome boy<br/>
You had dreams of being a dope boy<br/>
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po<br/>
Banging for the truth, late night huntin'<br/>
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,<br/>
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first<br/>
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church<br/>
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st<br/>
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse<br/>
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE - SNOOP DOGG]</i><br/>
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made<br/>
Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would moul me<br/>
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,<br/>
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,<br/>
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted<br/>
To the life, you just don't OD, I owe the streets before they owe me<br/>
Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and cops<br/>
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man<br/>
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams ??<br/>
The reason I'm so nice with my hands ?? shit, you think I forgot, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE - SNOOP DOGG]</i><br/>
Thank good every day that the boy could spit<br/>
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit<br/>
I know I got plenty more awards to get<br/>
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids<br/>
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit<br/>
They made me how I am, the music in the man<br/>
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn<br/>
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan<br/>
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand<br/>
Probably be doin' a dub and the pin with my man<br/>
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand<br/>
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans<br/>
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins<br/>
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids<br/>
If it all come down and my carrier was to end, I'm sure my name<br/>
Would live.. in the streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I just can't say goodbye<br/>
<br/>
I can't say goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
I can't say goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
I can't say goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
I can't say goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
Goodbye<br/>
<br/>
You can take the man out the streets,<br/>
But you can't take the streets out the man
