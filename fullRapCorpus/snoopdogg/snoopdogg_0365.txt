Wannabe’s, Wannabe’s,<br/>
Gangsters, Hustlers, Killers, Riders, Rappers, Singers, Real G’s<br/>
Wannabe’s! <br/>
<br/>
Wanna dress like, wanna talk like us<br/>
Wanna be like, wanna walk like us<br/>
Nigga used to be soft, now you wanna be tough<br/>
Used to be in your video, shaking like Ugh?!<br/>
You motherfuckers be doing too much<br/>
Wanna be hating now you wanna be us<br/>
I ought a really be clapping at ya’ll but instead I’m straight laughing at ya’ll<br/>
Then a nigga had the nerve to say fuck snoop dogg<br/>
Cuz got a perm and he just brought a coupe ya’ll<br/>
Tattooed L.B.C. on him and every little G in the streets want in<br/>
They talking about Cuz ain’t from the set, <br/>
And when they catch him in the hood, he gon get checked<br/>
Young G you better be where you say you’re from, <br/>
Where you from Cuz?? Wannabe’s!<br/>
Niggaz gon hit you up, what it do Crip?<br/>
Niggaz want everything, even your bitch!<br/>
Used to be jewelry, and just your whip<br/>
Nowadays everybody is in it for the chips<br/>
My Grandmamma living in the south, understand me she even had to tell me what it’s about<br/>
Say the white kids on the block wanna get a flex, say they love me like Elvis, ain’t that a bitch?<br/>
<br/>
Wannabe’s, Wannabe’s,<br/>
Gangsters, Hustlers, Killers, Riders, Rappers, Singers, Real G’s<br/>
Wannabe’s! <br/>
<br/>
You Niggaz wannabe’s I was raised by these streets<br/>
Ex D-boy I did my thang in these streets<br/>
Went out of towns on so many licks<br/>
On Everything I love, wrapped so many bricks<br/>
Catch me in the coupe with my hat sitting low<br/>
In a rental car wit the mac and the snow (haha)<br/>
Or In a prizewinner wit the mac and the blow<br/>
A half a mil a trip and I put that on Crip<br/>
Inglewood homies and they so Piru<br/>
And So a nigga love every time I come through<br/>
The big homie told me Go on get em Nephew<br/>
Make it do what it do, these niggaz ain’t you<br/>
No wordplay, ad-libbed yo, yeaaaah!<br/>
Outta line, pull a half clip yo<br/>
Send em back to the lab, a lot of braggin’ going on<br/>
Try and sound like ya boy, a lotta bank going ***<br/>
Just one problem, that ain’t your life<br/>
Nigga just two problems, that ain’t your ice<br/>
Told ya’ll Niggaz and I showed ya’ll niggaz<br/>
Fuck around and make me expose ya’ll niggaz<br/>
Who me? I went rock for rock, then I stacked it all up and went block to block<br/>
They got that Yayo money, lay low money, cold blooded killer better pay yo money<br/>
<br/>
You say you are, yet you not what you say you are<br/>
You don’t know who you are, you gon do it, I did it in crisis<br/>
Barry wanted to be white, Marvin was gay, Gladys chose a pimp<br/>
Nigga you fell in love with a tramp, Not the baddest bitch,<br/>
Half of a gangster started this sucker’s dream, <br/>
You spoke up when you should shut up<br/>
With them eleven dollar words coming out of your two dollar mouth<br/>
About a multimillion dollar Crip, that’ll smack the protein and the gingivitis out your lips<br/>
Little boy you don’t retrospect nothing, you better respect the 5 star guerilla crip<br/>
With bars and stars and more stripes than a zebra and a Siberian tiger<br/>
While you kiss that man who never fucked your mama, call him Pa!<br/>
This is the sickest shit I ever saw, what part of the game is that<br/>
You can’t make a tramp a champ, even if you put on a stamp<br/>
She still wouldn’t be worth a crying dime, or a blue nickel or a screaming quarter<br/>
When it comes to this game, lil nigga you totally out of order<br/>
I said, It don’t matter what you say or what you doing?<br/>
Whatever your G file may be? If it comes out that you’s a homosexual<br/>
That your snitching, you can ride the army, jack the navy, handcuff the marines<br/>
Your G File is a sponge
