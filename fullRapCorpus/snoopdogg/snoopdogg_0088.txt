<i>[fades in]</i> .. {y'all gone miss me}<br/>
Yeah y'all gone miss me<br/>
<i>[harmonizing]</i> Never miss what you had 'til it's gone<br/>
Yeah, y'all gone miss me<br/>
(y'all gone miss me) Yeah, y'all gone miss me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Hmm, who that nigga that brought you that gangsta shit<br/>
befo' you motherfuckers was even ready for it?<br/>
Showed you how to tie a flag on your head<br/>
and represent your motherfuckin set 'til you're dead<br/>
Bust on the cops while I cuss the Feds<br/>
Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin head<br/>
Put the G in the P, flipped the G to a ki<br/>
Put the West coast back on the map bay-bee<br/>
Check my styles, check my files<br/>
I've been gangbangin since I was a juvenile<br/>
They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth<br/>
Keep it gangbang 100 proof<br/>
E'rybody say, "Ay Snoop" - did Death Row pay me?<br/>
Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy<br/>
I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast<br/>
Tupac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: KoKane]</i><br/>
Rain-drops, falling on my head<br/>
Fuckin with them haters, messin with my bread<br/>
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head<br/>
Fuckin with them haters, sleepin in my bed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Ain't No Limit to this shit, ain't no gimmick<br/>
Master P good lookin out homeboy, salute my Lieutenant (at ease)<br/>
I'm in it knee deep and can't creep no more<br/>
I had to move down South on the low-low, fo' sho' doe<br/>
Dippin through the woods with Fiend, Magic, Pokey<br/>
Mystikal, V-90, C, Boz and P (ya heard me?)<br/>
Windows on tint, ridin like the President<br/>
It's evident, shit I'm doin good (yeah)<br/>
I moved out the hood like I should (say what?)<br/>
And then they had the nerve to call me Hollywood (nigga what?)<br/>
But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood<br/>
20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good<br/>
Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?<br/>
Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you<br/>
Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it<br/>
And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ variations]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on<br/>
Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home<br/>
with a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers<br/>
Bonafied killers<br/>
The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet<br/>
Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal<br/>
I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal<br/>
I'm drivin DoggHouse to the next level (woof)<br/>
and buckin two shots at the devil<br/>
Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel<br/>
Turn up the treble cause I hit you with the bass<br/>
Remember my name and remember my face<br/>
Remember these words, and remember the taste<br/>
And remember, we all gotta leave this place<br/>
I'm tryin to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game<br/>
The Rap Prime Minister, "Mr. G Thang"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two: KoKane]</i><br/>
Rain-drops, fallin on my head<br/>
Fuckin with the wrong folks, messin with my spread<br/>
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head<br/>
Messin with my ba-by, who's sleepin in my bed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[harmonizing to fade with interjections of "y'all gone miss me"]</i>
