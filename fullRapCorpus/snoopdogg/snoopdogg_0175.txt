<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light (at the light)<br/>
I got kush in my blood, sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut,<br/>
And all the people when they see me like "Snoop turn it up!"<br/>
<br/>
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light (at the light)<br/>
I got kush in my blood, sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut,<br/>
And all the people when they see me like "Snoop turn it up!"<br/>
<br/>
Im in my zone MO'FUCKER, get stuck in the ribs by a old BONE CRUSHER,<br/>
Two tone leather with the soul of a HUSTLER,<br/>
Tryin' to stack mayos steal the clothes from my BROTHER, <br/>
People wanna know am I close to my MOTHER,<br/>
Im a premature baby I'm ahead of the OTHERS.<br/>
Yes I'm aware of the GUTTER, ahead of my time, the games gettin' SMOTHERED<br/>
I stay on the grind but its only gettin ROUGHER<br/>
Niggas think I'm playin 'till they smokin' like a MUFFLER,<br/>
'bout to take like a lane open on you BUSTA'S.<br/>
Catch me if you can, in a world full of SUCKA'S<br/>
Niggas keep synthin', they wanna be USHER,<br/>
Until they get their eyes and coffin closed by the USHER,<br/>
Their punches wont work, you need more MUSTARD,<br/>
Lord lay 'em down, he need no sufferin', nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hmm, on my road to RICHES, I done seen a lotta roaches 'n' BITCHES<br/>
Thats why the dogg keep low in the DISTANCE,<br/>
But niggas don't know when to LISTEN, thats why I load AMMUNITION,<br/>
And stay in touch with my COMPETITION, I'm in touch with my COMPOSITION,<br/>
Roll a blunt, it's the coosh, yea we got PRESCRIPTIONS, just to defy,<br/>
No ENCRIPTIONS, pick a side, yea you know we CRIPPIN',<br/>
And through my eyes I see the world DIFFERENT, a hundred g's to record WITH 'EM,<br/>
Hit the gas, give me more ENGINE, this is somethin' that was born IN 'EM,<br/>
No game for a bitch just for a FIDDLE, I'm in tune give me more RHYTHM,<br/>
I let the bullets and the swords HIT 'EM, all p's like a Porsche EMBLEM,<br/>
Now make dead with the MORTICIAN, nigga, this big Snoop Dogg you best to listen,<br/>
You heard me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
