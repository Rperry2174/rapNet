Say man that nigga Snoop Dogg promised me a record deal man<br/>
That nigga promised me he was gon' come over man and do some things with me man<br/>
That nigga Snoop Dogg promised me, man the nigga promised a whole lotta stuff man<br/>
But he didn't come through man<br/>
Look nigga, I'ma promise you this<br/>
<br/>
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this<br/>
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch<br/>
I'ma promise you this<br/>
<br/>
Nigga had to walk 'bout four days<br/>
These niggas actin' like hoes nowadays<br/>
When I was young I used to hustle for my own shit<br/>
A 20 nigga slanging with them insane crips<br/>
I made my way out they call me Snoop Eastwood<br/>
Didn't forget where I came from, went back to the hood<br/>
Signed niggas, gave jobs and I made bail<br/>
And kept a lot of motherfuckers from goin' back to jail<br/>
Retail, hoe sale, OG's won't tell<br/>
Oh yeah they will, oh yeah they will<br/>
But I paid no mind I get back on my grind<br/>
I had a football dream to have a football league and I did that<br/>
<br/>
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this<br/>
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch<br/>
I'ma promise you this<br/>
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this<br/>
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch<br/>
I'ma promise you this<br/>
<br/>
Niggas said something outta place, dawg<br/>
I'ma let it go, I can't catch a case dawg<br/>
These motherfuckers prayin' on my downfall<br/>
I run the paint when it comes to this roundball<br/>
See I'm a legendary nigga doin' legendary shit<br/>
Smoking on the blunt with your temporary bitch<br/>
One thing's for certain, two thangs for sho<br/>
I'm a Long Beach nigga everywhere that I go<br/>
If I do, if I don't, if I will, if I won't<br/>
See time is money and it's the first of the month<br/>
Quit actin' funny my nigga<br/>
And go get your money my nigga<br/>
He do, 3, 2<br/>
<br/>
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this<br/>
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch<br/>
I'ma promise you this<br/>
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this<br/>
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch<br/>
I'ma promise you this<br/>
<br/>
Say man (I'ma promise you this)<br/>
Look I don't even promise my wife or my kids nothin'<br/>
So what I look like promising you something nigga (I'ma promise you this)<br/>
Look here you need to get a get something<br/>
<br/>
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this<br/>
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch<br/>
I'ma promise you this
