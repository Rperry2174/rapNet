They don't sleep, well freak off brand knock em out<br/>
Stay deep, bring heat make streets emorge<br/>
Young Gs, Lil Gs, casualties and war<br/>
So we push the turf steady pushin work<br/>
Niggas love seein thugs so we look for dirt<br/>
Where the shit don't stop and them six fours hop<br/>
If ya just get socked, don't trip gettin dropped<br/>

<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
All black wit a little bit of gold<br/>

Footin to the metal, every hand on stiletto<br/>
Extra clip when we book out, peace we long ghetto<br/>

From the LB city, where them shells leave many<br/>
Wannabes on they knees, tryna beef wit a gizze<br/>

Fuck them paramedics and them crooked ass cops<br/>

Gettin mad stuck, catch you comin out the cut<br/>
Hoo ridin, G ridin fuck the law<br/>
Better hope you on my side once I clutch and draw<br/>
My reactions, attractions, fast and all actions<br/>
Till I die east the side, I stay smashin<br/>
