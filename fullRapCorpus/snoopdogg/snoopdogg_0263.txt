Oh, it can't be right...<br/>
"How come?" meets the end...<br/>
Before you leave me, say a word...<br/>
And it's a waste of time<br/>
I know that I change<br/>
The way your heart picks the ones you love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
What's the difference when you say all the words?<br/>
You'll still be with her, and I'll be fighting for more<br/>
What's the difference when you explain she's the one?<br/>
No, I don't think straight - cause I'm a woman who's madly in love<br/>
<br/>
You should say goodbye<br/>
But baby, it wouldn't even matter<br/>
...the way I'm losing love<br/>
They say it'll pass...<br/>
But lately I don't even bother to leave the light on...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
