Yeah, gimme some gangsta shit curr<br/>
Some of that hood shit<br/>
Coming up<br/>
How that sound <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
I've been doing this shit since day one<br/>
Yeah nigga, day one, day one yeah<br/>
<br/>
Let me, let me tell you what your worth is<br/>
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose<br/>
Only you can make me happy, surface<br/>
East side long beach baby, the turf shit<br/>
The place where I lurked at<br/>
13 on the scene getting bent back<br/>
With a whole lotta snake venom<br/>
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center<br/>
Up early getting shit started<br/>
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', crippin' cold hearted<br/>
Way before I got high man<br/>
Both double up 15s from the pie man<br/>
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan<br/>
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan<br/>
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man<br/>
Let me show you how fly I am<br/>
Play in the school, lay in the pool<br/>
And I stay in the cool<br/>
Young loc I ain't playin with fools<br/>
Reset, repeat<br/>
Unlock and recock<br/>
The heat and it gets so fast<br/>
Spend yo cash<br/>
It will get in yo ass<br/>
Now the question is this for now<br/>
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?<br/>
Another man's trash is another man's treasure<br/>
What's your pleasure?<br/>
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye<br/>
On my balcony, asking how can I?<br/>
<br/>
How can I love somebody else<br/>
When I can't love myself enough to know<br/>
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'<br/>
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches<br/>
Bad 4 me<br/>
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me<br/>
<br/>
Curr I used to run with struck out gon' away<br/>
Cold things is he called me on the phone today<br/>
Told me he was up for release<br/>
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets<br/>
Yeah loc, shit don' change<br/>
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange<br/>
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now<br/>
I drove there the other day<br/>
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray<br/>
Its sort of hard for me to run away<br/>
Step out my car no gun today, underlay<br/>
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up<br/>
<br/>
How can I love somebody else<br/>
When I can't love myself enough to know<br/>
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'<br/>
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches<br/>
Bad 4 me<br/>
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me<br/>
<br/>
The true definition of that mixtape<br/>
<br/>
How can I love somebody else<br/>
When I can't love myself enough to know<br/>
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'<br/>
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches<br/>
Bad 4 me<br/>
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me<br/>
<br/>
Somebody pass that piff, grow it up<br/>
Thats My Work, 2<br/>
