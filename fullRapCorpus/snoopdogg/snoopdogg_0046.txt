<i>[C-Murder]</i><br/>
For all them young niggas that didn't quite make it to another year<br/>
<br/>
To all my thugs in the grave<br/>
This one is for my homies and my thug niggas<br/>
A bunch of used to be paranoid drug dealers<br/>
A bout 'it motherfucker standing on the block<br/>
Ain't no limit to his heart, cause his veins is non-stop<br/>
And constantly a nigga catching them cases<br/>
With them death situations<br/>
A nigga blast with no hesitation<br/>
Mama I wanna now where my daddy at<br/>
My only memory is a picture with a chrome gat<br/>
I wanna do, like them gangsters do<br/>
I wanna gangster walk<br/>
I caught a bullet now I'm in some chalk<br/>
Just another young nigga in a song<br/>
Mama always told me gangster's don't live long<br/>
After I'm dead can you still see me<br/>
Do you really want to be me<br/>
I'm just another bossaline<br/>
I represent all them niggas trying to get paid<br/>
But couldn't be saved<br/>
Huh, y'all now what I'm talking about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: C-Murder and Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
To all my thugs in the grave<br/>
See ya when I get there<br/>
See ya when I get there    <i>[ repeat 4X ]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mystikal]</i><br/>
Ride nigga till I deduct<br/>
Them things die nigga for fuck<br/>
Fly. fly nigga<br/>
Since you absent I'ma tilt the bottle<br/>
hit the weed and get high for my nigga<br/>
My partner my nigga<br/>
My round in my trigger<br/>
From the little shit I remember you was a down ass nigga<br/>
I'm mad i missed shit you could have showed me  (fuck)<br/>
Shit still ain't the same even though my mama told me<br/>
I keep your memories in my endeavors    (nigga)<br/>
Thank you for being my daddy, thank you for what you left us<br/>
I swear to protect, and the only way to carry on, is carry on<br/>
My nigga little Mike, my nigga G-Slim, and my cousin Larry gone<br/>
I ain't trying to question God, but why so young<br/>
That's why from daylight to night time I got my gun<br/>
This fucking thing we call life ain't nothing but a phase<br/>
That's why you better keep your faith,or you're that thug in the grave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Rest in peace khaki's creased<br/>
From the east side of Long Beach<br/>
Pouring out liquor, thinking about my homie<br/>
Cause I can't understand how it went down<br/>
We used to clown from town to town<br/>
Claiming dogg pound<br/>
Took you on lollapalooza with a nigga<br/>
L0Dog you my nigga<br/>
If you don't get no bigger<br/>
Spanky Loco from the the dub, and Little Man from the I<br/>
Dear God why them good niggas have to die<br/>
I can't reminisce too long<br/>
Cause I'm in a war zone<br/>
If I sleep, slip, trip I might get blasted on<br/>
So I'm gone mash on home<br/>
but on the way I see some of my enemies<br/>
And they tripping on me<br/>
Cause I fuck with Master P<br/>
But I;m heated, so beat it<br/>
And another 87 case, I really don't need it<br/>
Proceeded, I ain't gone cry for the homie<br/>
Shit we gone celebrate<br/>
Cause we now the homeboy is in a safer and better place<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 3X]</i>
