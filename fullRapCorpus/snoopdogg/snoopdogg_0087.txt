Yo Snoop, it's your country uncle Master P man<br/>

Thank you for ery'thing you did for No Limit<br/>
We won the fuckin war together<br/>

It ain't No Limit Snoop, you been good to me<br/>
Now it's time for me to be good to you<br/>
I'm bout to give you your own blocks wodie<br/>
You do what you wanna do<br/>
Bring 'em in, we get the kilos from the South to the West<br/>
We ship 'em, give it to the world<br/>
Sell it to the fuckin record stores!<br/>
Tell the fuckin haters to shut up!<br/>
Cause it still ain't No Limit<br/>
I know they thought this was "Tha Last Meal"<br/>
