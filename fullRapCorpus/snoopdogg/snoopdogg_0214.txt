I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good<br/>
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could<br/>
Jealousy envy please don't feel bad<br/>
This weed is mine get your own bag<br/>
A sack full of O.G. under lock and key<br/>
None for the homies this is all for me<br/>
Got a blunt looking like a Cali palm tree<br/>
Police roll by I got nothing on me<br/>
Cause the smokes already in the air<br/>
I'm locc'd up with two braids in my hair<br/>
All star star with the khaki suit<br/>
I'm a fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop<br/>
On the east side standing on the V.I.P.<br/>
Back then the only red was E-Y-E<br/>
You's a P.Y.T. and you looking so fine<br/>
I'm sorry baby girl but tonight<br/>
<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
This weed is mine you can't have it<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
This weed is mine you can't have it<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
<br/>
Back to the episode sacks full of chronic<br/>
Out of this world could relax on a comet<br/>
This is church music listen to the choir<br/>
To burn my kush you must use fire<br/>
D-O double G like never heard before<br/>
Smoking that bomb like T-H-C 4<br/>
West coast worldwide seashore to seashore<br/>
When's the last time you seen a G in a G4<br/>
Don't worry I'll wait<br/>
Times ticking I'm tripping I'm slipping away<br/>
Into a zone where these hoes on my dog bone<br/>
A dog whistle and they download my ringtone<br/>
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem<br/>
What I got here is mine gone get your own<br/>
I put beats to rhymes get peace of mind<br/>
O-Z's to dimes and this weed is mine<br/>
<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
This weed is mine you can't have it<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
This weed is mine you can't have it<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I hear niggas talking bout what they rolling up<br/>
Smell what I smoke fore the bag open up<br/>
Good chance if you see me then I'm smoking one<br/>
Licensed to get it from the men who grow the shit<br/>
Real nigga blowing weed before I was old enough<br/>
If I'm in the building it's hard not to notice it<br/>
Hit up Willie said dog I got some hoes to fuck<br/>
I'm a fall through with an ounce of that potent shit<br/>
Don't trip nigga we gonna all sip blow the whole zip<br/>
Let you hit mine plus you supplying your own lil bit<br/>
My nigga get high and let the hoes twist<br/>
Say you don't fuck with twists look how you rolled it<br/>
They ain't smoking like ours I'm rolling up paper they be burning for hours<br/>
And if it's fire I'm smoking the whole thing entire<br/>
<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
This weed is mine you can't have it<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
This weed is mine you can't have it<br/>
This weed is mine<br/>
<br/>
I got a roll for you do you wanna smoke with me<br/>
I wanna smoke with you do you wanna smoke with me<br/>
I got a roll for you do you wanna smoke with me<br/>
I wanna smoke with you do you do you<br/>
<i>[Repeat out]</i>
