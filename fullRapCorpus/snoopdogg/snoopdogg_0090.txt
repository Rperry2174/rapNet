<i>[Bigg Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You'z a fool fo' dis, yeah<br/>
My dogg Hi-Tek, representin' Cincinnati, Ohio!<br/>
Eastside shit, y'all know how we get down<br/>
7 dizzles a wizzle, Bigg Bow Wiggle's, up in the hizzle<br/>
Fo' shizzle bizzle, here we go again<br/>
<br/>
Freshly dressed, I jump up in the mo'nin' tryna find some Zest<br/>
Psyche, we like the Bom, somebody betta ring the alarm<br/>
And hit the folks at the forum<br/>
Let my homies off the yard<br/>
I shall see the head nigga in charge<br/>
Push... Bush outta office, dump 'til they get off us<br/>
Make them offers, that leave niggas in coffins<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Can you feel it my nigga, I'm 'bout to kill it my niggas<br/>
Sound like guerillas, fo' real'a off gangsta government millas<br/>
Coke killas, when it comes to off mic'n wit me<br/>
I was branded in a gang, fuck havin' techniques<br/>
Just ride, not a damn lettin' these fools breathe<br/>
Pop peas, push keys, find a stash fo' yo cheese<br/>
Is it possible that laws might get jealous<br/>
Hell yeah they be hatin' on the 3 Good Fellas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Over-dosage of ferocious, WestCoast in effect<br/>
Bang straight gangsta shit, so you know it's on deck<br/>
Hold and respect, cold as it get, don't wanna test<br/>
Kidnap ya wife and ya kids, you get the message<br/>
Insanity, commanded me to savagely spit<br/>
Suffer casualties, challenge me, I handle it quick<br/>
No talkin', C-Walkin', we chokin' the block off<br/>
Lettin' the glock off<br/>
And throwin' up DoggHouse <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
WestCoast niggas and we all in yo house<br/>
Gang bang niggas we gon' turn this bitch out<br/>
Eastside ridaz and we all in yo mouth<br/>
Dogg Pound Gang we let the mothafuckin' doggs out<br/>
Nate Dogg, Goldie, Snoopy, Tray Deee<br/>
Never loved a ho and run the "G-A"  in me<br/>
Always got a bitch, but never in the front seat<br/>
Still the same let the mothafuckin' doggs out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Yeah! it's about to get Crip'd out crazy<br/>
Blast on all you suckas with the throw away to daily<br/>
Don't you shoot that little mothafucka no mo'<br/>
That ain't what he said when he hit the chest went through his heart, came out his elbow<br/>
You shouldn't have been talkin' that shit bitch boy<br/>
Sayin' the wrong thing against the real McCoy<br/>
Didn't know I was a cold-blooded gangsta<br/>
If you ain't ridin' wit us fool, we'll catch ya lata<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
We exploded, reloaded and sewed it up<br/>
Sprayed shots to the crowed, like a loaded pump<br/>
Keep this mothafucka jumpin' 'til they close it up<br/>
Then we dippin' wit a sip and some hoes to fuck<br/>
Pour late, the hard way, ain't no bustas here<br/>
So explict you can only get it once a year<br/>
Eastsidaz, the ridaz, they change the game<br/>
And let you know from here go, we straight came to bang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bigg Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Put me on a leash if you dare and I doubt you<br/>
Ever see someone here, who gave a fuck about you?<br/>
Niggas on the streets gon' keep talkin' shit about you<br/>
As long as you clap fool, it's bigger than 'bout too<br/>
Fuck wit fools, that ain't never paid us<br/>
And try to turn the homies into traitaz<br/>
Blue rags with blue balls, fo' all you hataz<br/>
I shoot a shout out to the killas<br/>
Yeah them stealas and Raiders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>

Ain't nobody really fuckin' wit deez<br/>

And all the women wit extensions in well fed conditions, you bitch! (You Bitch!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bigg Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Hey! who let the mothafuckin' gate open? <br/>

Post up, make about a million a month<br/>
Hittin' Bloods!, switchin' guns!<br/>

<i>[Hook: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>

Gang bang niggas we gon' turn this bitch out<br/>
Eastside ridaz and we all in yo mouth<br/>
Dogg Pound Gang we let the mothafuckin' doggs out<br/>
Nate Dogg, Goldie, Snoopy, Tray Deee<br/>
Never loved a ho and run the "G-A"  in me<br/>
Always got a bitch, but never in the front seat<br/>
