<i>[Verse 1 – Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em<br/>
Be about your paper nigger take it<br/>
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck<br/>
Suckers tryna get a check<br/>
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call what it wasn’t<br/>
Tryna kiss a nigger all in public, bitch, is you crazy?<br/>
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before<br/>
I ain’t no motherfucking rookie<br/>
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s<br/>
I ain’t tripping off these walls<br/>
You know these rats is after cheese<br/>
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind<br/>
They be focus on his dick and keep your focus off my time<br/>
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill<br/>
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business<br/>
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere<br/>
Cause bitch I’m on that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me<br/>
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying<br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me<br/>
Bitch don’t even try it<br/>
I’m out here grinding, that's why<br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Devin the Dude]</i><br/>
We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop<br/>
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch<br/>
Cause it’s over and through<br/>
But why do I need a bitch when I got you<br/>
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team<br/>
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together<br/>
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside<br/>
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen<br/>
F-ck one that once sucked my dick and find another (bitches)<br/>
I don’t need ‘em, don’t buy ‘em nothing to drink, I don’t feed them (bitches)<br/>
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them<br/>
No, I don’t wine and dine them (bitches)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me<br/>
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying<br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me<br/>
Bitch don’t even try it<br/>
I’m out here grinding, that's why<br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 – Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Hell no, I don’t need one<br/>
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me<br/>
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed<br/>
Before I let a bitch get the best of me<br/>
I don’t need no bitch bitch bitch<br/>
The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger<br/>
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya<br/>
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch<br/>
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker<br/>
Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker<br/>
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place<br/>
Never understood when it was work day<br/>
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way<br/>
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre<br/>
Cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere<br/>
Cause bitch I’m on that, bitch I’m on that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me<br/>
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying<br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me<br/>
Bitch don’t even try it<br/>
I’m out here grinding, that's why<br/>
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….<br/>
<br/>
You need to quit talking crazy<br/>
I don’t need no bitch<br/>
You need to quit talking crazy
