<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
YEAH! Aight Bigg Dogg<br/>
It's 'bout that time<br/>
You got a cup or bottle or blunt in your hand<br/>
Follow directions please<br/>
Let's, GO!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Problem]</i><br/>
Put 'em on up - and turn them thangs upside down<br/>
Said put 'em on up - and turn them thangs upside down<br/>
Put 'em on up - and turn them thangs upside down<br/>
(What?) Upside down (what?) Upside down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Mm... the Boss in the buildin<br/>
Try to turn it on you get offed in this buildin<br/>
Higher than a muh, gettin lost in the feelin<br/>
Motherfuck the law, I got a ball for the chil'ren<br/>
Nigga - drunk than a bitch though<br/>
'Fore I hit the spot I had a bottle full of Cisco<br/>
Ate the kush and a model in a trenchcoat<br/>
A Crip with a lot of cash, check on how the wrist roll<br/>
Baby saw it in my eyes and she knew that I was lookin at her<br/>
Ain't a chance to get her, I can M-I crooked letter<br/>
If she with a nigga I'ma steal her, yeah a crook'll have her<br/>
throwin up the E once the D get to cookin in her (Eastside!)<br/>
Yeah - so what's it gon' be?<br/>
Golden black Joe Clark, H.N.I.C.<br/>
Regulatin on any hatin I see<br/>
Some'n good in your hands then repeat after me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Problem]</i><br/>
Put 'em on up - and turn them thangs upside down<br/>
Said put 'em on up - and turn them thangs upside down<br/>
Put 'em on up - and turn them thangs upside down<br/>
(What?) Upside down (what?) Upside down<br/>
Put 'em on up - and turn them thangs upside down<br/>
FUCK IT UP! And turn them thangs upside down<br/>
FUCK IT UP! And turn them thangs upside down<br/>
FUCK IT UP! Upside down - FUCK IT UP! Upside down<br/>
FUCK IT UP!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Problem]</i><br/>
Yea, yea<br/>
Damn fool, you could see it in my face though<br/>
I'm shittin, I'm shittin what I ate hoe<br/>
Fuck that, I'm drinkin 'til I throw up<br/>
Turn like a mug, c'mon whole hood showed up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Bang to the boogie, keep a thang in my Dungarees<br/>
Bailin through the Eastside, feelin like a younger G<br/>
Eatin like a muh, but I'm so so hun-g-ry<br/>
I dare one of these young dumb fucks to try and fuck with me<br/>
Fucka - I'm back to the party<br/>
Marley, Bacardi, shawty, gnarly<br/>
Becky, and Vicky, beggin me to give me hickeys<br/>
Through my Dickies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Lil' mama tryin to show the Dogg her G-string<br/>
while she sang ain't "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"<br/>
A nigga throwin signs tryin to let me know that he bang<br/>
Like I give a motherfuck what he claim<br/>
Ay - your nigga better chill doggy<br/>
'Fore I treat him like a old bitch and menopause him<br/>
I'll stop your ass right there<br/>
I swear had homies on your head like hair<br/>
Homie I ain't thinkin, I'm too busy drinkin<br/>
Plumber of the month, mami show me where your sink is<br/>
So I can get to uncloggin<br/>
I hope that lil' cat ready for this Bigg Dogg and WOOF!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Problem]</i><br/>
Pause... pause... pause...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nipsey Hussle]</i><br/>
Look, I'm just a young nigga in the biz with mo' enemies than friends<br/>
Get no money goin out, but I got it comin in<br/>
And nah, I ain't a G but every day that's what I spend<br/>
I get paid to drop a verse, for 16 I need ten<br/>
End.. all the speculation<br/>
Them pre-conceived notions got me over-compensatin<br/>
And for you slow niggaz that mean not been concentratin<br/>
I'm shittin on these records while you rappers constipated<br/>
Uhh, it's get money, fuck haters<br/>
Me and hip-hop is like Chucks and blue laces<br/>
Me and Snoop Dogg is Sir Charles and King David<br/>
With Problem we all ballin like the '09 Lakers<br/>
Yeah, it's Terrance Martin on the track<br/>
And I'm that young nigga droppin crack back-to-back<br/>
My album on the way and I ain't worried 'bout the stats<br/>
But I could tell you how the streets gon' react<br/>
They gon' say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
