<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas<br/>
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz<br/>
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas<br/>
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Freeze, at ease, now let me drop some more of them keys<br/>
It's 19-9-tre so let me just play<br/>
it's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic, I'm back with Dr. Dre<br/>
But this time I'ma hit yo' ass with a touch<br/>
To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up<br/>
So sit back relax new jacks get smacked<br/>
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg I'm at the top of the stack<br/>
I don't lack for a second, and I'm still checkin<br/>
The dopest motherfucker that ya hearin on the record<br/>
it's me, ya see, S-N-double-O-P<br/>
D-O-double-G-Y, the D-O-double-G<br/>
I'm fly as a falcon, soarin through the sky<br/>
And I'm high till I dizzie, rizzide<br/>
So check it, I get busy, I make your head dizzy<br/>
I blow up your mouth like I was Dizzy Gillespie<br/>
I'm crazy, you can't phase me<br/>
I'm the S oh yes, I'm fresh, I don't fuck with the stress<br/>
I'm all about the chronic, bionic ya see<br/>
Every single day, chillin with the D-O-double-G's<br/>
P-O-U-N-D that's my clique, my crew<br/>
Ya fuck with us, we gots to fuck you up <br/>
I thought ya knew, but yet and still<br/>
Ya wanna get real, now it's time to peel, ya say chill<br/>
and feel, the motherfuckin realism<br/>
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the mic i'm hittin hard as steel nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
How many hoes in your motherfuckin group<br/>
Wanna take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille<br/>
Chill, as i take you on a trip<br/>
where them niggaz ride, and slide, you know about the East Side<br/>
Niggaz like myself, here to show you where it's at<br/>
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back<br/>
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me<br/>
but you know how that goes<br/>
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row<br/>
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it<br/>
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip<br/>
Still clockin grip, and really don't give a sheeit<br/>
about nuttin at all, just my Doggs, steppin through the fog<br/>
and i'm still gonna fade em all<br/>
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin<br/>
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin?<br/>
Every single one, to get the job done<br/>
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one<br/>
Where the sun be shinin and i be ryhmin<br/>
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I come creepin through the fog with my saggin Dukes<br/>
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeBille<br/>
I'm rollin with the G Funk, bumpin in my shit and it don't quit<br/>
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set<br/>
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit<br/>
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin dick<br/>
And the Compton niggaz all about to set trip<br/>
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this<br/>
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff<br/>
And keep the motherfuckin blunt in your pocket loc<br/>
Cuz Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke<br/>
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from<br/>
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some<br/>
But watch the gun by my side<br/>
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin East Side<br/>
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow<br/>
yippie yo, you can't see my flow<br/>
My shit is dope, original, now you know<br/>
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow<br/>
<br/>
