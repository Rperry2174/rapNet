<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
G Mix!!!! I was a fiend, before I became a teen<br/>
I melted cabbage sacks instead of cones of ice cream<br/>
Crime orientated that's how the west was originated<br/>
Fitted like pieces of puzzle, complicated<br/>
I droppped the sack and tried to rap hits y'all<br/>
They tried to bang on me, and say that I'm too small<br/>
Cool!!! Cause I don't get upset<br/>
I call the king of the east catch a flight then I jet<br/>
Right back to the west, where my niggas is at<br/>
Scoop the gilly put it back on the map<br/>
Like this like that while you rollin a bag<br/>
Loadin ya gat, pop pop, I'm holdin ya back<br/>
I'm like the Whopper FUCK THE BIG MAC!!!<br/>
Run up on the dog my gat go click clack<br/>
And that's fo' sho!!! <br/>
The reason why, man I don't know so let's go cuz<br/>

Tonight I'm on some other shit, and baby lovin it<br/>
Hella fast, grip dey ass like the oven mitt<br/>
I'm gooned up, boy! Rich as fuck, boy!<br/>
Black and gold brakes, that's my truck, boy<br/>

My niggas all long, we rollin out deck<br/>
Hoes gettin in, you betta pick a bitch<br/>
'Cause when I shut it down, the party's over wit<br/>
She call me Superman, I'm on my (Soulja) shit (YOOOOOOOU!)<br/>
Boss Dogg, get 'em, I sick 'em and take 'em home<br/>
