Yeah yeah yeah I'm fin up in the corner in my<br/>
lowrider dogg. Ya heard me?<br/>
<br/>
Top dollar with the gold flea collar<br/>
dippin' in my blue Impala (DPG)<br/>
<i>[Repeats throughout intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Yeah it's still a G thang)<br/>
It's time for all the lowriders out there<br/>
yeah all the dippers you like to get ya dip on<br/>
hit a switch or two, bang a corna' sittin' on threes<br/>
yeah right trip...<br/>
<br/>
It's like 4 &amp; to the 5 &amp; to the 6 &amp; to the 7<br/>
I once was told that all doggs go to Heaven<br/>
Well how ya been where ya been &amp; what it look like?<br/>
My game trump tight especially when it bump like<br/>
four DPG's gettin' crazy<br/>
&amp; No Limit is the label that pays me!<br/>
Ridin' 'round town layin' game down like Goldie<br/>
&amp; I remember what my momma showed me<br/>
told me game recognize game<br/>
&amp; stay true to what ya do &amp; don't be ashamed<br/>
I got all my game from her sometimes I have to wonder<br/>
how I keep from goin' under I'm a cold muthafucka<br/>
I fall to my knees &amp; thank God before I do my thang<br/>
I don't know why, I love to gangbang<br/>
See life ain't nuthin' but a twist anyway bitch anyway<br/>
you can say what you wanna say<br/>
Just don't get in my way 'cause I'm a mean old<br/>
Fiend know C know &amp; P know see loc<br/>
We make music for the thugs and the bangers<br/>
and the bitches. Fuck you R&amp;B singers<br/>
She want a nigga with his khackies hangin' real low<br/>
in a black rag Sixty-four hmm<br/>
Rollin' down the street lookin' way clean<br/>
bangin' that real shit nigga like Al Green<br/>
I'm headed straight to the LB<br/>

Sell me everythang except some bullshit<br/>
and when it's time for the gunfight nigga pull quick<br/>
Cause ain't nothin' butter but us<br/>
and nigga you'll get wet up for fuckin' with my cheddar<br/>
It's cold outside nigga grab ya sweater<br/>
and that bad bitch you fuckin' with<br/>
nigga she get ya set up<br/>
Boy you done put all ya trust in that hoe<br/>
didn't ya see what happened to the President niggaro<br/>

You fucked around &amp; stuck ya dick<br/>
in that white bitch mouth<br/>
What you talkin' 'bout? Fool I'm dirty like the South<br/>
and to be real I feel that's how I'm comin' out<br/>
Back on the hoe stroll highway pimp patrol<br/>

Coldest entertainer gangbanger since Alphonz Capone<br/>
Count money like Basie police try to chase me<br/>
Niggas try to replace me but you can't<br/>
I'm ridin' in a tank I'm blowin' hella dank<br/>
So whether ridin' in ya lo-lo or smokin' on some doe doe<br/>
spread the word and take the fo' door<br/>
The Last Don done hooked up with the muthafuckin'<br/>
King of the coast with the most here's a toast<br/>
and Snoop Dogg is the representer<br/>
through the niggas &amp; G's through the LBC's<br/>
and the Calio projects Brooklyn to Queens<br/>
Chi-town woe now the Dogg Pound in the house<br/>
everytime we touch down right next to my hometown<br/>

and got the bitches posted up in the parkin' lot<br/>
