<i>[Intro: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
What it do? Comin at you live<br/>
It's your boy Bigg Snoop Dogg<br/>
Got my nephew Soulja Boy in this motherfucker<br/>
And we need you to move like... pronto, like expeditiously<br/>
Matter of fact, Soulja Boy, holla at 'em nephew<br/>
Ya diiiiiig?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Soulja Boy]</i><br/>
Pronto; you know that's how we ball<br/>
She dancin on my drawers with my back against the wall<br/>
S.O.D. boys got our money sittin tall<br/>
While yo' money sittin small, then we make a phone kiz-zall<br/>
Kiz-zall, I'm callin all my boys<br/>
They gonna bring the noise when we hit the dance floor<br/>
My team hardcore, all the girls do adore<br/>
I'm 'bout to do the game right til my feet get siz-zore, siz-zore<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soulja Boy]</i><br/>
Stepped on the scene, make the haters say damn it<br/>
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, hottest rapper on the planet<br/>
Your girl love me, and I know you cain't stand it<br/>
Gotham City girls got your boy Bat-Mannered<br/>
Your girl go hard like Dikembe Mutombo<br/>
Soulja number one but I ain't talkin 'bout the combo<br/>
S.O.D. boss yeah, I'm the head honcho<br/>
Walk inside the club I need V.I.P. pronto<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Get it in, get it out, turn it up, turn it out<br/>
Bigg Snoop Dogg and Soulja Boy, told ya boy, in ya mouth<br/>
Make it bang, make it bounce, break it up, take it out<br/>
Nigga what you talkin 'bout? Snoop Dogg, walk it out<br/>
Go to work, do the jerk, do it 'til yo' head hurt<br/>
We the west, kiss the turf, known throughout the universe<br/>
Superman and kryptonite, all on the same mic<br/>
Send us some bad bitches like... (pronto)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B]</i><br/>
Church on the move, L7's yellin mayday<br/>
Rap-A-Lot and "II Trill" lookin fo' a payday<br/>
Rollin to "The Chronic," it's feelin like it's +Dre Day+<br/>
I'm cooler than an +Ice Cube+ and you can ask Day Day<br/>
Bun B, an O.G. from out the dirty<br/>
I'm comin down candy and I'm sittin on them 30's<br/>
Your girlie's kinda purty, she actin kinda flirty<br/>
I'ma have to take her to the crib and flip her like a birdie<br/>
Put on for my city (city) rep it for my block (block)<br/>
Like Hook from outta Brooklyn, or Cap from outta Watts (Watts)<br/>
Them knots up in my Levis, them Jordans on my toes (toes)<br/>
That Coogi's on my back and I'm just tryin to get chose (chose)<br/>
S.O.D. Money Gang, sittin on them stacks (stacks)<br/>
That LBC O.G. with boppers on the track (track)<br/>
And last but never least the Underground King is back<br/>
And we tryin to make it crack, that's a fact, pronto (pronto)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
All black hooded up, nigga we can get it up<br/>
Yeah you can set it up, cause we will never let it up<br/>
And I'll do it 'til you get enough<br/>
And I'll leave you dead and red and stuff<br/>
What it do, what it is<br/>
I see you haven't read enough<br/>
This is the life I chose for me, and this is the way I chose to be<br/>
A lot of fools is cold to me, but that's just the way it's 'sposed to be<br/>
Never went against the grain, always bang 20 Gang<br/>
Stand for something dog or you gon' fall for anything but<br/>
Later for that, yeah I got my swag back<br/>
I'm with the Soulja Boy, now nigga back back<br/>
For them G.C.'s and T.C.'s we in the V.I.P.<br/>
Blowin on some Laker purple trees, jerkin these<br/>
Workin these cute bad bitches, I think they Vietnamese<br/>
We gon' get them for they cheese<br/>
Break it down, spread it 'round, buy a pound<br/>
Put it in the air right now~! Like pronto (pronto)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
