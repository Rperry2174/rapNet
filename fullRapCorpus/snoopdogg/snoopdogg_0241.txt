<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So long we’ve been on this journey<br/>
And I know we can make it<br/>
Stay strong our hearts been yearning<br/>
And no one can break it<br/>
Round and round our road keeps turning<br/>
No one can stop the time<br/>
It’s just another bridge we’re crossing<br/>
Keep this message in your souls and minds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
They try to break a bond<br/>
But what they didn’t know<br/>
That we were built so strong<br/>
Ye they didn’t know<br/>
But in their hearts and minds<br/>
We were gone<br/>
Said we were an old show<br/>
Baby don’t you cry<br/>
For as long as I’m alive, you live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So long we’ve been on this journey<br/>
And I know we can make it<br/>
Stay strong our hearts been yearning<br/>
And no one can break it<br/>
Round and round our road keeps turning<br/>
No one can stop the time<br/>
It’s just another bridge we’re crossing<br/>
Keep this message in your souls and minds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
If I should die tonight<br/>
I’d be happy that I knew you<br/>
If I should lose my sight<br/>
It’s still know all with all my mind<br/>
If all the words and fights<br/>
Still can’t get it right<br/>
Baby don’t you cry<br/>
For as long as I’m alive, you live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2):]</i><br/>
So long we’ve been on this journey<br/>
And I know we can make it<br/>
Stay strong our hearts been yearning<br/>
And no one can break it<br/>
Round and round our road keeps turning<br/>
No one can stop the time<br/>
It’s just another bridge we’re crossing<br/>
Keep this message in your souls and minds
