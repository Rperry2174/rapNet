I wanna see you working baby, you’re my dirty dancer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You’re my dirty dancer<br/>
You’re my dirty dancer<br/>
You’re my dirty dancer<br/>
You’re my, you’re my dirty dancer<br/>
You’re my dirty dancer<br/>
you’re my dirty dancer<br/>
you’re my dirty dancer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
That’s my dirty girl, she do her dirty dance<br/>
She get dirty money, for her dirty man<br/>
She give me everything, she take her dirty chance<br/>
She say I’m something new, not like her other man<br/>
Well let me do the thinking, this what I recommend<br/>
My nigger money talk that’s what she comprehend<br/>
Say that sad story, you hear them violins?<br/>
And for a tall glass of Landy, here it is<br/>
She living in my lap, just like a two for one<br/>
See that’s the fact, couple of stacks, she gonna leave with one<br/>
Shoot that weak gang, like a bb gun<br/>
And watch her do her thang, oh she gonna get it done<br/>
This girl body out the game, she a home run<br/>
She my dirty dancer, I owe her one<br/>
System overload, brain overdone, it’s Big Snoop Dogg,<br/>
Go on sing it Trey Songz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz - Chorus:]</i><br/>
You know money aint a thang, I love the way you working it<br/>
Drinks on me cause I love the way you twerkin’ it<br/>
Tell me is you ready? What’s your answer shorty?<br/>
You’re my dirty dancer<br/>
You’re my dirty dancer<br/>
The cash on deck, what you working with<br/>
Face down, ass up<br/>
From the club to the crib, you know what it is<br/>
You’re my, you’re my dirty, you’re my dirty dancer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2:]</i><br/>
She my dirty dancer, this her favorite song<br/>
And when she at the house, when she all alone<br/>
She in the mirror dancing nasty with no panties on<br/>
I see you girl, fantasizing about to set the tone<br/>
Can’t wait to put your heels, and stilettos on<br/>
I know you’re ready show the world what you really on<br/>
Dancing like that, you might need a license<br/>
So enticing, dancing while she setting prices<br/>
Damn, thats dangerous but lucrative<br/>
Do it right, go big and you get super rich<br/>
With that fat ass and them super hips<br/>
Slow motion mami, we know you the shit<br/>
It’s a dirty world so be a dirty chick<br/>
And I’ll do them other girls this about chips<br/>
Let it take control and make it make sense<br/>
Money ain’t a thang, you’re my dirty chick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Girl you know I want it, don’t you want it too<br/>
I can do whatever, he was never ever gonna do<br/>
Girl your body’s so sick, I just wanna touch you<br/>
Take your clothes off and your toes curl up<br/>
Do ya body body like nobody never do<br/>
Get it like ohhh, do it,<br/>
Once we’ve done it, you’ll be feeling like ooooooh<br/>
Had a lot of women but nobody like yooou<br/>
Girl the way you move<br/>
Baby puyt ya tricks on me<br/>
And she do it real quick, 6 feet<br/>
Get ya red lipstick please<br/>
Do ya dirty dance on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
