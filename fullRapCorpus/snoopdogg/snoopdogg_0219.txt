<i>[John Legend - Hook]</i><br/>
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now<br/>
Feeling like my life froze<br/>
I’m about to hit the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state<br/>
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate<br/>
Never going down, stay rising like Andre<br/>
Cause my corner back every thing the Don say<br/>
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song<br/>
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home<br/>
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city<br/>
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net<br/>
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game<br/>
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?<br/>
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between<br/>
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame<br/>
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at<br/>
pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that<br/>
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back<br/>
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend - Hook]</i><br/>
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now<br/>
Feeling like my life froze<br/>
I’m about to hit the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2]</i><br/>
I do it cause I feel it<br/>
Live it like I’m talkin’<br/>
Flow so straight but wont a nigga try and ?<br/>
I’m so high, yeah the weed, I’m still sparking it<br/>
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling<br/>
Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons<br/>
Breads in the bag, call it good marketing<br/>
Life’s a bitch but I don’t cartigan?<br/>
That's what a word to the third letter<br/>
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar<br/>
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather<br/>
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever<br/>
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever<br/>
Cause I don came from a long path<br/>
Only God knows how long the Dogg has<br/>
Cause like time we all pass<br/>
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend - Hook]</i><br/>
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now<br/>
Feeling like my life froze<br/>
I’m about to hit the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West - Verse 3]</i><br/>
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal<br/>
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal<br/>
This game you could never win<br/>
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again<br/>
Get away from me misery<br/>
Get away from me loneliness<br/>
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness<br/>
Get away from me wack tracks<br/>
I can only make only hits<br/>
I’m an only child lost in the World<br/>
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring<br/>
Its Feeling like hell rings<br/>
Bringing me back down<br/>
Checking my background<br/>
Its ironic whats happening<br/>
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends<br/>
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends<br/>
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk<br/>
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk<br/>
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more<br/>
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore<br/>
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him<br/>
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again<br/>
till then I’ll be pouring out my soul<br/>
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now<br/>
feeling like my life froze<br/>
I’m about to hit the ground
