<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Lets make a move for this paper, where we rollin dog?(uh-huh)<br/>
We gots to get paid, make ya money all yall (what)<br/>
When I step to the stage in my g-boy stance (what)<br/>
And say a few rhymes that make your girl wanna dance<br/>
I'm so fly like a dove, I come from up above<br/>
You're trippin on your girl cause she showed me love<br/>
Nigga dont beat her, cause if you beat em, ya dont need em<br/>
Yeah they gon have your baby<br/>
Watch how fast they take your freedom (what, uh-huh)<br/>
I believe em, and dont mistreat em, I stay up on em (what)<br/>
But thats one to grow on nigga, let me flow on (cuzz)<br/>
Cause uh, you could rock to the rhythm you see (what)<br/>
But you could rock to the rhythm on me..(uh-huh) me.. (uh-huh) me..<br/>
But when you do your thang make sure you do your thang<br/>
On the hang, and everythang is everythang<br/>
Man, I'm on this paper chase<br/>
Like them whiteboy D.A.'s was on the case (uh-huh)<br/>
But you know I ain't tryin to floss but<br/>
Murder was the murder was the case that they lost<br/>
(murda murda murda murda)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Now do anybody in the house remember<br/>
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (yeah)<br/>
There was no rappers hollerin LBC<br/>
Am I trippin yall? (hell naw)<br/>
Now, when I grow up I wanna be like Snoop, mad pussy and women<br/>
As we do from the beginnin (uh-huh)<br/>
In and out of the Boz Hotel, they say your family dont know me<br/>
Hold on homie, thats phony, informal<br/>
Say, tell, L's in jail, vest before test<br/>
No one in my click fell (what)<br/>
The females with the almighty fatherly<br/>
Cuz we thinkin bout peeps, what they need<br/>
And it ain't no party like this kind (say what)<br/>
Cause you feelin where we make it hizzot<br/>
But I'ma get back to the grizzats<br/>
Snoop D O double G comin back for a remizzax<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?<br/>
