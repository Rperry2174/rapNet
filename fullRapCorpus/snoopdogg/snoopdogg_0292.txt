<i>[Pharrell &amp; (Stevie Wonder):]</i><br/>
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)<br/>
Get yourself a medical card, yeah (in Los Angeles)<br/>
Cause that's how California rolls<br/>
They do the fingers like Redd Foxx, hey (in Los Angeles)<br/>
You can make it on a light blue box, yeah (in Los Angeles)<br/>
Cause that's how California rolls, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Say when I pass you that weed and I ask you can you roll?<br/>
You say roll, don't you know that I'm from round here?<br/>
Well girl I like the way you roll<br/>
Even though you from the ghetto you belong in a home in the mountains<br/>
Not talking 'bout the view<br/>
I'm talking 'bout me and you<br/>
So if you wanna go to Melrose<br/>
Let's hit Adidas, girl we got our own shell toes<br/>
And then we'll go to Venice<br/>
You roll so good you might as well let me hit it<br/>
For like 15 minutes<br/>
Girl, you never gon' forget it<br/>
And if you wanna go around town<br/>
I could show you where all the real get it<br/>
And if you wanna go downtown<br/>
You might as well roll with a real nigga<br/>
I'm not talking 'bout them fools<br/>
I'm talking 'bout me and you<br/>
<br/>

Ain't got nothing to lose<br/>

And girl I got a home in that valley, in a rolls in that valley<br/>
Just tell 'em what my name is<br/>
You heard about me, you heard all about me<br/>
Mean you heard all the hittas that I'm with gangbanging<br/>
But I ain't talking 'bout the news<br/>
Girl you know that I'm talking 'bout you<br/>
