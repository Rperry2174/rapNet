<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Pop Pop Bang<br/>
Do my Diddy<br/>
Claim my gang<br/>
Rep my city<br/>
<br/>
One, two, three it's me<br/>
Baby bopper, I'm hot as lava, I gotta be<br/>
Eight bottles, a lot of models, a pot of bean<i>[?]</i><br/>
Top dollar, the blue impala, know what I mean?<br/>
Drifting away, you, you can't keep running away<br/>
I wanted to say, we play the original way<br/>
Either you stay, lay the pistol or pay<br/>
We official, okay?<br/>
I got cooked up dope sent down from the bay<br/>
From my cousin Ricky, with the sticky icky<br/>
West coast baby girl, come and fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
People come from everywhere to get a dose of the Cali life<br/>
Like palm trees and bomb weed<br/>
Riding on that sunset night<br/>
Home of the crips, yeah cuz that's us<br/>
Relative, gotta live, what it do blood?<br/>
Only grind one time, yeah that's the digs<i>[?]</i><br/>
Better get some heat, when you're creeping through the beach<br/>
To each his own, the leash is long<br/>
Turn it up and get your T.C on<br/>
And tell em' Snoop Dogg sent him to the block<br/>
Let it rock while it not<br/>
Motherfucker, show you how to west coast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz:]</i><br/>
Homie keep it gangster, tell me how do these feel<br/>
Pop pop bang, swing it on three wheels<br/>
House party g<i>[?]</i>, we raised off of g-shit<br/>
When it's time to get at it, you know we get sea-sick<br/>
We with the business by any means necessary<br/>
You can't fuck with us homie, we'll <i>[?]</i> and make it scary<br/>
I popped her cherry, and she gave it up in a flash<br/>
We wanna bang with Snoop, we wanna bang with Daz<br/>
Hop inside a g-ride and glide, take a voyage<br/>
Back to the east side, east side's where we're going<br/>
Where the hustlers <i>[?]</i> us raw with no worries at all<br/>
When you learn to see <i>[?]</i> before you learn to crawl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
