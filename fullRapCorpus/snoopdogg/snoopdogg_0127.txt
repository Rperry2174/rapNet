<i>[Chorus - Pharrell Williams &amp; Vanessa Marquez]</i><br/>
<i>[V]</i> Can I get more thrills?<br/>

<i>[V]</i> Can I get more thrills?<br/>
<i>[P]</i> You know you want some more girl, so come on<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Looking at the ladies, all of them fly<br/>
I don't know which one I want dawg<br/>
I can't make up my mind, girl<br/>
So won't you make it easy on me?<br/>
Take this drink, then hit this weed<br/>
Two step wit me, let's slip to the dance floor<br/>
On and on and on and on we go<br/>
I'll dip you if you want me to<br/>
You see I really wanna get a little front wit you, bigidy bump wit you<br/>
A nigga wanna hump you and then just comfort you<br/>
And then I'll pop the top and lay you on the cot, and get you nice and hot<br/>
Yeah yeah, it's all to the real<br/>
We could do it like Guy, c'mon girl "Let's Chill"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now you can fly the friendly skies<br/>
With the S-N double O-P D-O double G-Y<br/>
Now don't ask why, just keep looking good in the hood<br/>
Damn girl, you so fly! We could do what you want to<br/>
You say you drink Alize or was is Malibu? It don't really matter though<br/>
You remind me of the time when I had a ho<br/>
She kept telling me Doggy Dogg I gotta go<br/>
So I let her get in the wind and co-macked her friend<br/>
2 plus 2, it equals 4, this is some shit that could last forever more<br/>
I'm trying to put my bid in, naw I'm just kidding<br/>
Come on ma get in, and don't ask where we going<br/>
Pimping and hoeing, drink pouring and weed blowing, you know it c'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I've been looking at you, from the corner of my eyes<br/>
Checking out your hips, lips, tits and your theighs<br/>
I've been wanting to do you, for a mighty long time<br/>
You make a pimp wanna sing I - I - I<br/>
We'll head to the hills, your dreams I'll fulfill<br/>
We could do it how you want, cause I'm oh so real<br/>
Tell me you, naw I won't squeal<br/>
You wit Da Big Bo$$ Dogg so seal the deal<br/>
Pharrell got the Babyface and Snoop got the Whip Appeal, so name the place<br/>
This love I bring to you, on the real baby girl<br/>
Won't you do me a favor and sing for Snoop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Pharrell &amp; Vanessa]</i><br/>
You know you want it!! (if I got it I'm a give it to you)<br/>
So come and get it!! (if I got it I'm a give it to you)<br/>
If I got it (if I got it I'm a give it to you)<br/>
(Then you can get it) Ya know! Hey!!! Oh!!<br/>
Can I get more thrills? .. Can I get more thrills?
