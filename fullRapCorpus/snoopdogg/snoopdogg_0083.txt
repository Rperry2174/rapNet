<i>[Eve]</i><br/>
Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking<br/>
Cause the Ryders got me bringin home the bacon<br/>
Show me love, and it wasn't no mistakin<br/>
that I would dedicate this melody - fuck the hatin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit<br/>
cause she slipped and dipped inside<br/>
I need a girl that's ready to ride<br/>
to keep the heater right by her side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eve]</i><br/>
Aiyyo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg<br/>
Niggaz seem (?) to the brain, how you feel Dogg?<br/>
Nigga I'ma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg<br/>
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Baby girl you so so-phisticated<br/>
Finance related, you graduated<br/>
to the next level in the game, wearin my name<br/>
Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eve]</i><br/>
Yo - niggaz surprised when they open they eyes<br/>
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan<br/>
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man<br/>
Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly<br/>
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me<br/>
Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy<br/>
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin crabby<br/>
That's why he bagged me<br/>
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy<br/>
No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
We gangbang on these niggaz like we 'posed to do<br/>
and I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you<br/>
We posted Boo - you, my, one and only<br/>
Quick to dump before the homies<br/>
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?<br/>
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love<br/>
All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin<br/>
Thuggin, dig it, dug-in<br/>
I'm lovin every minute of it Boo<br/>
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool<br/>
You kept the heater right by your thigh<br/>
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride<br/>
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out<br/>
That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt<br/>
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know<br/>
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eve]</i><br/>
Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need<br/>
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees<br/>
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes<br/>
And if I heard you was frontin I hope on the case<br/>
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby<br/>
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy<br/>
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my (?) strong<br/>
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah.. hahah, E-V-E! D-O-double-Gizze! Y'know!<br/>
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin! Foe life, ahh! Yeah..<br/>
And you thought it'd never happen<br/>
Fuck the haters, bow wow!<br/>
Woof.. woof.. woof.. woof..<br/>
<i>[Dogg panting]</i> BEOTCH!<br/>
It's official now, yeah<br/>
We gon' Ruff Ryde up on out of here on this one<br/>
Eastside up Eastsidaz<br/>

Give it to 'em Dogg<br/>
