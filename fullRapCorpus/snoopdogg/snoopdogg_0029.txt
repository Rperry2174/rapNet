<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I think it's bout' time that we hit these n***as upside<br/>
the head with some of that west coast<br/>
gangsta' sh.........  Ooh.....Wee!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Verse:]</i><br/>
It's a whole 'nother day<br/>
I'm back up in ya'<br/>
Snoop D-O-Double G<br/>
I representa'<br/>
Been away for a while but you all know<br/>
I'm still doggystylin' on Death Row<br/>
Got shit locked down<br/>
Sewed up<br/>
So If you plan on comin' out nigga hold up.<br/>
This a stick up<br/>
dick up<br/>
They got yo' shit on the shelf, oh mine is too<br/>
and guess who they gon' pick up?<br/>
Some niggas think they know they shit<br/>
But they don't<br/>
Some M-A's escape <br/>
Some won't<br/>
Bumpin' heads with niggas<br/>
Where you from?<br/>
East Side Long Beach, nigga, 2-1<br/>
The homie just got paroled<br/>
And he got more stories than the highway patrol<br/>
Tellin' me about the money Suge Knight stole<br/>
But I'll make that shit late<br/>
Cause nigga I get swole<br/>
Niggas tryin' to get in, to get out.<br/>
Put me up on game tellin' me who gon' jack me<br/>
But ever since <br/>
I was a puppy<br/>
till I was paroled<br/>
I never had no other dog pullin' on my chrome.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Say Snoop's upside yo' head, <br/>
say Snoop's upside yo' head. <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse:]</i><br/>
Niggas in the game be doin' way too much<br/>
Akin' tough with this east-west coast stuff.<br/>
See Me<br/>
I'm all about my money mane<br/>
I stay fly and dry<br/>
I don't get caught up in the rain<br/>
Cuz game recognize game<br/>
No matter where you from<br/>
We all can get dumb, insane and<br/>
turn the party out<br/>
without a doubt<br/>
Unless <br/>
you them niggas who ain't got no clout<br/>
LBC and B what?<br/>
Uh, my crew<br/>
Cuz uh, we out there smokin' on the krazy glue<br/>
Upside yo' head like oops<br/>
Snoop's  <br/>
The shit, that you hear them bumpin' in the hoops.<br/>
Can't afford it<br/>
homeboy<br/>
This is finished<br/>
I represented<br/>
From V-A to Venice<br/>
So when it's timid<br/>
And cold outside<br/>
Rely on the Doggy Dogg<br/>
To put the heat in yo' life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse:]</i><br/>
It takes a whole lot<br/>
to be number one<br/>
I can't walk down the street<br/>
without my gun<br/>
I can't trust these niggas fool<br/>
It ain't no fun<br/>
I'm sittin' up in court<br/>
Cuz somebody got dumped<br/>
What really counts is how the crowd bounce<br/>
Go home and say<br/>
Snoop rocked the parte`<br/>
Nobody got kilt<br/>
It's what got annouced<br/>
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay<br/>
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold<br/>
Warm you up with the sheet<br/>
Zip you up and roll<br/>
Now Doggystyle records is now official<br/>
Gettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials<br/>
Shippin' weapons overseas<br/>
I'm makin' G's<br/>
What who you make call enemies<br/>
But I<br/>
See nothing funny about<br/>
makin' money<br/>
Cuz uh<br/>
We all know it don't grow on trees<br/>
So I<br/>
Gotta' get what I gotta' get when I can<br/>
Up homie in the mo'ning wit' the gat van<br/>
Burning rubber down to get a new car<br/>
So don't get jealous when you see me in the<br/>
double R.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (3x)]</i>
