<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block<br/>
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop<br/>
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't<br/>
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life<br/>
So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay<br/>
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay<br/>
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't<br/>
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life<br/>
Now this is for the Bs and the Cs, and the Ds and the Hs<br/>
And the Gs putting work in overseas<br/>
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed<br/>
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me<br/>
Baby this is presidential really<br/>
A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living<br/>
Show them hoes how you winning<br/>
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given<br/>
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon<br/>
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men<br/>
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends<br/>
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs<br/>
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go<br/>
You know how the Dogg roll. Don't get it twisted<br/>
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit<br/>
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with something pimpish<br/>
And it's coming from the beach where them niggaz is a beast<br/>
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past<br/>
I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last<br/>
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise<br/>
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus â€“ Akon or Nate Dogg:]</i><br/>
See me man, I'm nothing like you<br/>
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to<br/>
I'm leaning in my ride, fo' fifth, cock banging<br/>
Me, I'm riding by ya on the corner, block slangin<br/>
I'm living that boss' life (life)<br/>
The hoes come running when they see me coming<br/>
I'm living that boss' life (life)<br/>
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South<br/>
Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths<br/>
Thinking that they blessed by the actions that be coming out<br/>
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout<br/>
But tricking ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it<br/>
There's a method to you holding it when they can't do without it<br/>
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it<br/>
You can have her and her partner, fucking with it for a dollar<br/>
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller<br/>
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala<br/>
And if she follow then she gon' swallow<br/>
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow<br/>
But I would never bother breaking out (Tha Doggfather)<br/>
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, having diamonds on his collar<br/>
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners<br/>
Walking on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
