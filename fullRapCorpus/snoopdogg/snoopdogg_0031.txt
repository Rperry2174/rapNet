<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!<br/>
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)<br/>
To a place that be, call it LBC<br/>
(I'm ridin' wit'cha baby)<br/>
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!<br/>
To a place that be, call it LBC<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Verse:]</i><br/>
Now if you tired of the hard work<br/>
tears and sweat<br/>
and you breakin' your neck<br/>
and you still up in debt.<br/>
Walkin' round town all strapped in,<br/>
niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.<br/>
Two strikes none left, out of breath<br/>
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.<br/>
All this deception on top of stress,<br/>
you havin' more problems than a algebra test.<br/>
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,<br/>
and now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.<br/>
It's a thin line, between yours and mine<br/>
the difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.<br/>
Now I know a place where<br/>
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there <br/>
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind<br/>
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse:]</i><br/>
Oh your homies think you're funny?<br/>
Doin' stick ups for moneys <br/>
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)<br/>
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,<br/>
you got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.<br/>
You all about yo' money and got something to sell<br/>
but if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.<br/>
You chillin' wit yo' feet up<br/>
Someone hated but baby without the homies and<br/>
that's when you got beat up.<br/>
Because you can't be out there doin' low<br/>
and then right gather up yo' crew and roll.<br/>
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,<br/>
somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.<br/>
But see, I know a place where<br/>
you might wanna be <br/>
and I can take you there<br/>
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind<br/>
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge One:]</i><br/>
Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all.<br/>
To a place that be, call it LBC. <br/>
(I'm ridin' wit' ya' baby)<br/>
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,<br/>
know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Cuz he travelin' in the fast lane.<br/>
<br/>
Stop the life it seem that we are on,<br/>
Time to slow your roll,<br/>
Let Doggyland be your new home,<br/>
Stop the life it seem that we are on,<br/>
time to slow your roll,<br/>
Let Doggyland be your new home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse three:]</i><br/>
Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne<br/>
(It's goin' down)<br/>
Everything is free,<br/>
and ain't no HIV. (What?)<br/>
And niggas don't kill one another <br/>
(Oh really why is that?)<br/>
Because a brother is a brother.<br/>
(And what about the mothers?)<br/>
They queens,<br/>
righteous, <br/>
man,<br/>
heaven must be like this,<br/>
green aroma like the grass in the summertime.<br/>
Ain't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time.<br/>
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,<br/>
I'm smarter than the senator,<br/>
Bigger than the mayor.<br/>
Heaven on Earth <br/>
it's like a prayer.<br/>
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got<br/>
to be a player.<br/>
Now you know a place where<br/>
You gots to be and I took you there,<br/>
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind<br/>
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.<br/>
<br/>
