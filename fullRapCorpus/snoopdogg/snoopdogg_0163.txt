<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
1992, "Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop<br/>
"Doggystyle" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb<br/>
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time<br/>
I was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free<br/>
Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me<br/>
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G<br/>
Niggaz knew it was Eastside L.B.C.<br/>
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get<br/>
The one up above didn't like my pace<br/>
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case<br/>
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case<br/>
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I done made some mistakes along the way<br/>
To become the G I am today<br/>
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?<br/>
Out the hood to be a big star<br/>
And I ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
Homie I ain't never comin' down<br/>
I'm too high in the clouds<br/>
To ever have to worry 'bout that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm finally out<br/>
And the critics hated on me 'cause I went to the South<br/>
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead<br/>
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead<br/>
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak<br/>
"No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast<br/>
So from that point on I know what to do<br/>
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do<br/>
"Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash<br/>
That's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me<br/>
Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold<br/>
I'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I done made some mistakes along the way<br/>
To become the G I am today<br/>
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?<br/>
Out the hood to be a big star<br/>
And I ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
Homie I ain't never comin' down<br/>
I'm too high in the clouds<br/>
To ever have to worry 'bout that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Bo$$ of the City, Bo$$ of the Coast<br/>
Some other niggaz tried but none of 'em come close<br/>
They stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc<br/>
The Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke<br/>
(Wow!) That's what it's about<br/>
They tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth<br/>
Motherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man<br/>
Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban<br/>
So they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk<br/>
to some women as hoes, like it's my fault<br/>
Damn they lost, man they just don't know<br/>
That a bitch is a bitch, and a hoe is a hoe<br/>
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk<br/>
I'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss<br/>
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk<br/>
I'ma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I done made some mistakes along the way<br/>
To become the G I am today<br/>
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?<br/>
Out the hood to be a big star<br/>
And I ain't goin' nowhere<br/>
Homie I ain't never comin' down<br/>
I'm too high in the clouds<br/>
To ever have to worry 'bout that
