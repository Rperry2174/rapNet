You brainwashed not to know you grew up wanting to be a pimp, you wanted to be a player (Right) You know, you grew up wanting to be these different things that are role models to you in your neighborhood, until you figure out that...hold on...I'm finna be the first role model that ain't that (Right)<br/>

<i>[Angela Yee The Breakfast Club:]</i><br/>
Well I had a chance to listen to the album, <br/>
it's very chill, it definitely makes you wanna smoke some weed<br/>
(Oh it do?)<br/>
Yeah, and I don't even really smoke<br/>
(You wanna hit some right now?)<br/>
I don't know if we're allowed to do that in here<br/>
(We need curtains, we need curtains in here)<br/>
No, Snoop can do what he wanna do<br/>
(I don't think so...)<br/>
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness<br/>
<br/>
And there ain't no doubt about it<br/>
Regarded as the freshest, by the way that I live<br/>
All the songs that I did, and givin' back to the kids<br/>
I mean I done been everywhere that you wanna go<br/>
And poppin' on a stick like a pogo<br/>
My logo, is similar to the bat sign<br/>
Way up in the sky, When you wanna get high<br/>
Now look up, Now look up, I shook up the game<br/>
With the versatility, verbability, toungetwistagility<br/>
Hell yeah, they love the dog<br/>
Grandmomma's worldwide wanna hug the dog<br/>
<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
<br/>
Look I'm back at it, melodramatic<br/>
A little more dope for you Snoop Dogg addicts<br/>
Addicted to the things I do, magic<br/>
Go go go but no gadget, I'm magic<br/>
If I wasn't invented<br/>
Then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it<br/>
I'm in it like I spread it, if I said it, All gas unleaded<br/>
For really though, I get that real hood love everywhere I go<br/>
From mommas, babies, grannies<br/>
You gotta love him even if you can't stand him<br/>
<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop<br/>
The way I feel about Snoop
