<i>[Intro/Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie<br/>
while you're bangin on ya baby OG's<br/>
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang homey<br/>
If I'm hangin it's with DPG<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Some do the things that they do cos they dumb<br/>
and some do the things that they do for crumbs<br/>
I do mine for me ya see?<br/>
Not the big homey double O-G<br/>
Scared to do your own work, man that's fast<br/>
and that's the reason why I had to shoot you down<br/>
because you never should've tried to work my Dogg<br/>
and the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump<br/>
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'<br/>
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!<br/>
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er<br/>
few many times too many and became a teller<br/>
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em<br/>
but they won't sell you the game to get up on em<br/>
Ya tryin ta find em cos you want em, they shook out<br/>
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out<br/>
it ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga<br/>
but it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us<br/>
But it's steel, you put it in their head<br/>
that at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kurupt]</i><br/>
<br/>
Aiyo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket<br/>
and make a loot, niggas want trip<br/>
Spittin like "you spoke beef from the hood<br/>
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit"<br/>
Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs<br/>
Made a non-believin man into a believer<br/>
Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say<br/>
"it's the way to get paid", DP's and pay<br/>
I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (why?)<br/>
Trippin cos you know the bomb's at where I'm at<br/>
Well if that's the case you shoulda roll<br/>
wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)<br/>
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue<br/>
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop<br/>
Niggas from Seth be tryin to set you cos you settin your ways<br/>
so ask DJ Pooh what pays<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Just what we need, bangin on wax another trip<br/>
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?<br/>
You're like a actor wit another script<br/>
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip<br/>
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?<br/>
You need to sit down and learn to get down first<br/>
cos, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers<br/>
not part-time FBI singers<br/>
Niggas havin bad intentions, sendin BG's on a mission<br/>
One move too many, nigga you missin<br/>
Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no<br/>
loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D<br/>
Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossin<br/>
but guess what it cost em, they crossin me<br/>
But before I give a nigga a 9<br/>
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x1 1/2]</i>
