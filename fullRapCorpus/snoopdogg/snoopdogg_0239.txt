<i>[Intro: Angela Hunte]</i><br/>
Show no fear, we made it clear<br/>
That the warriors are comming and we no play<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Angela Hunte]</i><br/>
We at war with the army of haters<br/>
And when we kill em we just smoke 'em like papers<br/>
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now<br/>
You might be a lord; but here comes the king <i>[X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
Here I come a steppin inna the dance<br/>
Here I come a steppin inna the dance<br/>
Posted up the wall here inna mi stance<br/>
Posted up the wall here inna mi stance<br/>
We never fail, we only shine with brilliance<br/>
One king one faith one religion<br/>
And if you hear me come and join the revolution<br/>
One king one faith one religion<br/>
And if you hear me come and join the revolution<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Angela Hunte]</i><br/>
We at war with the army of haters<br/>
And when we kill em we just smoke em like papers<br/>
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now<br/>
You might be a lord; but here comes the king<br/>
You might be a lord; but here comes the king<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
They gonna love me<br/>
Call me black chutney<br/>
All gold chrome with the diamonds in the back<br/>
Lil homies in the front don't know how to act<br/>
We comin deep and you never see us smiling<br/>
10 million strong and it will rumble when we are riding<br/>
Two shots up for my africans<br/>
Been around the world and back again<br/>
Feel so good gotta let me in<br/>
Power to the people let em kiss the ring<br/>
Bow - here comes the king<br/>
<br/>

Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now<br/>
You might be a lord; but here comes the king<br/>
You might be a lord; but here comes the king<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
They know me in japan and pakistan<br/>
Ganja makes me lord of all the land<br/>
I'm royalty no need for me to wear a crowm<br/>
Born a rebel then I became a man<br/>
I heard a voice, he said that I would understand<br/>
One king one faith one religion<br/>
And if you love me come and join the revolution<br/>
One king one faith one religion<br/>
And if you love me come and join the revolution<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Angela Hunte]</i><br/>
We at war with the army of haters<br/>
And when we kill em we just smoke em like papers<br/>
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now<br/>
You might be a lord; but here comes the king<br/>
You might be a lord; but here comes the king
