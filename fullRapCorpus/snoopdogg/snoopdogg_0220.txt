(I was raised in the hood)<br/>
Eastside Long Beach to be exact<br/>
(I was raised in the hood)<br/>
Where the grass is greener and the crips are much meaner<br/>
(We got ya, back, I was raised in the hood)<br/>
I'll never turn my back on the hood<br/>
(I was raised in the hood)<br/>
Yeah you can take me out the hood<br/>
But you can't take the hood up outta me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins<br/>
Yeah I'm stealing niggas, please what you know bout that<br/>
I do it everytime, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh weee)<br/>
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin in the beach when I lit my first doobie<br/>
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie<br/>
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi<br/>
Bitch, choose me, cause I'm going to the top<br/>
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I'm on bitch<br/>
Whenever will it stop<br/>
I was poppin' like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block<br/>
East up, what it do though<br/>
Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean<br/>
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a niggas still elope<br/>
Only cause I was raised in the hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)<br/>
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)<br/>
We got ya back<br/>
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)<br/>
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)<br/>
We got ya back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Raised by the monsters the criminals<br/>
The G's, it was ? the niggas on the east<br/>
What you know bout that?<br/>
Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss<br/>
I catch a nigga slippin' like moss<br/>
Ride with the realest , I've been on it since a young'n<br/>
It's 200 bitches in the function<br/>
Looking cool, you know it bitchy I'm rollin'<br/>
And I aint worried bout them niggas we patrolling the hood and the city<br/>
Rollin on that dilly<br/>
2 milly, 2 Bugatti's, call em Rozay and Diddy<br/>
Heart of the set, Homie I'm a vet<br/>
Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around,<br/>
I'm a rep, East up, what it do though<br/>
Hoes spillin' Nuvo, Doggy on his tip<br/>
I threw up the two O<br/>
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a niggas still elope<br/>
Only cause I was raised in the hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block<br/>
It was plenty of them niggas on the spot<br/>
What you know bout that?<br/>
Turned up fully<br/>
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig<br/>
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it's turned out<br/>
The people talking the rumours<br/>
Now what you heard about?<br/>
How I spend 100 thou gettin' purped out<br/>
I'm strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up<br/>
They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets cuz<br/>
Like I don't come from the W, I'm a beast bru<br/>
What it do though, dickies for the dulo<br/>
Homie, you know skinny niggas sumo<br/>
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a niggas still elope<br/>
Only cause I was raised in the hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
