<i>[Marty James]</i><br/>
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway<br/>
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali<br/>
Don't go 'less you go hard<br/>
Go 'less you go hard<br/>
<br/>
Hollywood, downtime and back<br/>
Life is always good<br/>
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood<br/>
You knew that it never would<br/>
Knew that it never would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Lakers, Dodgers, Ducks, Kings, Angels, Clippers<br/>
Real set trippers<br/>
Clarify ride, we bonafide dippers<br/>
ESPN, you know Sports Centre<br/>
Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet<br/>
Home of the NBA championship<br/>
Purple and Gold, homie let the story be told<br/>
It's the city where you shoot your favourite television episode<br/>
And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard<br/>
But you gotta have a Low-rider car<br/>
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'<br/>
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon<br/>
That's how we represent it though<br/>
Birthplace of Chevrolet '64<br/>
Yeah I love showing it out<br/>
First things first my nig', you better know where you at<br/>
You in...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway<br/>
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali<br/>
Don't go 'less you go hard<br/>
Go 'less you go hard<br/>
<br/>
Hollywood, downtime and back<br/>
Life is always good<br/>
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood<br/>
You knew that it never would<br/>
Knew that it never would<br/>
<br/>
Riding on the 405<br/>
On my way to pick up baby<br/>
85 in the winter time<br/>
Man, this place is crazy<br/>
I love it, love it, love it, love it<br/>
Southern surfer Cali<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doog - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Rollin' down Fairfax<br/>
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico<br/>
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes<br/>
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues<br/>
About 9 o clock stop by the record shop<br/>
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball<br/>
Life is a mystery, my life is like history<br/>
Stop by my dispensary<br/>
Give me some kush and pusha<br/>
Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk<br/>
But it's all legal in LA<br/>
Everybody taking a hit from the politicians<br/>
Athletes and even the teachers<br/>
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher<br/>
He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya"<br/>
Yeah, I love showing you now<br/>
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at<br/>
You in...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway<br/>
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali<br/>
Don't go 'less you go hard<br/>
Go 'less you go hard<br/>
<br/>
Hollywood, downtime and back<br/>
Life is always good<br/>
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood<br/>
You knew that it never would<br/>
Knew that it never would
