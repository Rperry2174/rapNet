<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Cadillacs, croker sacks<br/>
501's, policies<i>[?]</i> and golf hats<br/>
I go see, the homies is deep<br/>
Banging out, hanging out onto our street<br/>
Rules of the game, if you choose to bang<br/>
You can't be a snitch, don't be a bitch, nigga, make your name<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was young, I had a whole lot of fun<br/>
My mama bought me everything, even a toy gun<br/>
Coming when it's dezark, I'm up with the pizark<br/>
Playing quarterback and it's a must that I stezart<br/>
And I'm a fool on point like a dezart<br/>
And with the little mamas yea I'm breaking the hezeart<br/>
You know, time won't tell<br/>
Half of my homies is dead or in jail<br/>
So I'mma stick to the script like OG go-carts<br/>
Bitches scrap on, stole me out, you got no heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Footwear shit, yeah nigga, I'm in it<br/>
Authentic, business, I represent it<br/>
To the tippy, keep it so crippy<br/>
Smoke a whole zippy, put bread to the Skippy<br/>
Bow Wow yippie, long stocking like Pippy<br/>
Real G's fuck with me<br/>
Rare breed, different cut<br/>
West coast motherfuckers get up<br/>
Zip, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
