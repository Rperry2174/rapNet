<i>[INTRO:(mobster Corleone talking)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE ONE:(DAT NIGGA DAZ)]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face<br/>
The street value of that is what you dream to make<br/>
Run an illegal business,racketeerin<br/>
Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin<br/>
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit<br/>
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick<br/>
Different locations,spots where it takes place<br/>
If you show them my money,your ass is gettin f-laid<br/>
There's four major games that run the city of G's<br/>
The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me<br/>
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown<br/>
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown<br/>
Murder's an everyday thang in the city<br/>
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its<br/>
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons<br/>
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected<br/>
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot<br/>
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block<br/>
Let em have it as soon as they come out<br/>
Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[INTERLUDE:(DAZ talking)]</i><br/>
Throughout the streets of Long Beach<br/>
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts<br/>
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young<br/>
youth behaviour is outrageous with crime<br/>
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements<br/>
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs<br/>
from coming into our country, but they can't<br/>
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount<br/>
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars<br/>
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE TWO:(TRAY DEE)]</i><br/>
I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down<br/>
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town<br/>
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop<br/>
Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot<br/>
Had to be a standout not to get ran out<br/>
Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout<br/>
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos<br/>
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes<br/>
Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse<br/>
Cos the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first<br/>
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling<br/>
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin<br/>
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life<br/>
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes<br/>
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin<br/>
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin<br/>
Real niggas still get a mob like respect<br/>
If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck<br/>
Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file<br/>
Under G you will see not to sweat my style<br/>
I'm takin em out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[INTERLUDE:(Corleone talking some more)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE THREE:(SNOOP DOGG)]</i><br/>
I come through blastin,me as a Downtown Assassin<br/>
Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets<br/>
Shoot em down in front of Hassans<br/>
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?<br/>
In my zone,Don Corleone wanted<br/>
For the murder of forty men<br/>
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again<br/>
From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides<br/>
Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months<br/>
Big business and big dollars is all that I want<br/>
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make<br/>
Toast till we all die,till we burst and break<br/>
From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums   <br/>
We ran outta dope,I don't think so son<br/>
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park<br/>
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark<br/>
From when I pick em off like darts<br/>
Stab em in they hearts<br/>
Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead<br/>
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs<br/>
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die<br/>
All I ever want is to be left alone<br/>
Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome<br/>
Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz<br/>
I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs<br/>
<br/>
