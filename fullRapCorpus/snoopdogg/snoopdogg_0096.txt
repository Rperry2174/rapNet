<i>[Verse 1 - Prodigy, Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Out the muthafuckin depths in New York, its P<br/>
You couldn't get close enough to even touch the kid<br/>
If you did,you wouldn't get far enough to bag<br/>
I put my guns to work on your bitch ass<br/>
Hold up, niggas fuckin up the game<br/>
Put my name in statements, cooperating wit these and talkin<br/>
Fuck it, I'll still buck em and gamble wit my freedom<br/>
These niggas gon learn to respect the P-Dub<br/>
I don't take no shit off of nobody<br/>
No nigga, no bitch, lets get rich and party<br/>
Lets not test my gangsta, thats how you get bodied<br/>
Thats how hearts get took, pride get damaged<br/>
Lives is shedded, fuckin wit these east side niggas<br/>
We teach y'all niggas bout this murder shit<br/>
We got Tray Deee, Goldie Loc, Hav and P<br/>
Kokane, wit my nigga Snoop D-O-G-G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Big hitters, wig splitters, give niggas the blues<br/>
Fools loud mouth we all about spittin them tools<br/>
From the coast of the locs were the Gs was born<br/>
And we raise up B.G.s to keep it goin<br/>
In the alleys, not the valleys, killa Cali the zone<br/>
Long Beach bringin heat takin off when its on<br/>
Fuck pretty, come gritty when we bring the noise<br/>
Big boys play wit keeps when we bring the toys<br/>
Wet T-shirts, we search to put in work, cuz<br/>
Come back for ya homies as you gettin ya dirt dug<br/>
Congregatin, operatin Gs and hustlas<br/>
You other muthafuckas can't concieve our structures<br/>
The DPGC, the M-O-B-B, stricly east side and we ride on G.P.<br/>
Bandanas, hoodies, timbos and chucks<br/>
Stay mashin on bustas not givin a fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Snoop Dogg, Kokane]</i><br/>
Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep<br/>
We connected<br/>
From the West to the East<br/>
Connected<br/>
Oh what you got beef?<br/>
Connected<br/>
Run up on ya while ya sleep<br/>
Stay connected<br/>
My nephews play wit keeps<br/>
We connected<br/>
From the West to the East<br/>
Connected<br/>
Blast ya ass in the streets<br/>

<i>[Kokane]</i> Yeah <i>[repeat 30X]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Havoc, Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Havoc]</i><br/>
Connect wit my dogs be that serious shit<br/>
Serious things when M-O-B and sidaz bang<br/>
Ice and chains, be best that you hide those thangs<br/>
And pressure to that ass we apply those thangs<br/>
Told you fucks before, when it rains it pours<br/>
Its a cold ,cold, cold world nigga its Doggy Dogg<br/>
Better walk or crawl(for real), cause on the real homeboy<br/>
Fuck around and you'll be up in the morgue<br/>
Moms praisin the lords, rev paintin the picture<br/>
Of a wise young man who didn't get the picture<br/>
We keep it gangsta nigga, don't get it twisted nigga<br/>
Cross me nigga, you'll wind up a missin nigga<br/>
QB and we trully, rep for ours<br/>
Wars and scars, bitches in a gang of whips<br/>
When it came to this game though we changed the shit<br/>
And fuck who you wit, its what you up in the club but yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Uzis, AKs, Glock 40s and Tech 9s<br/>
Tryna take mines, you'll be a dead muthafucka<br/>
Come up short, wit yo life on support<br/>
Burnin rubber down the street in a black super spoke<br/>
Fo' pokes to the neck, five sticks to the dome<br/>
Gun powder on my clothes when I smacked him in his nose<br/>
Real talk, show you how to walk the walk<br/>
All black all times when I scheme and stalk<br/>
Its somethin about bein a cold blooded killa<br/>
I'm bananas my nigga, like a black ass guerilla<br/>
I'm G'd up, smokin all the muthafuckin weed up<br/>
Drinkin on a full cup nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah, defintely connected<br/>
How you love that?<br/>
Uh, like I said you can't spell the West wit out the ES<br/>
East side up eastsidaz<br/>
From QB to the LB<br/>
You see what I see and G how I G<br/>
Feel me?<br/>
Eastsidaz, duces and trayz the old fashioned way<br/>
Alchemist...<br/>
Uh, yeah-yay
