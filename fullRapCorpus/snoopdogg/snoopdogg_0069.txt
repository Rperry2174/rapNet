Hey yo Goldie Loc<br/>

No disrespect to them other hoods<br/>
But this is where I'm from <br/>
3-2-1 I can't cum<br/>
No other way <br/>
No way, no how<br/>
You know the bowwow do it Long Beach style<br/>
To the fullest young nigga row<br/>
With my steal I cap home feeling like a O<br/>
No he didn't, yes he did<br/>
Bank your chin in her crib<br/>
This ain't no fed<br/>
But now he did<br/>
On the other side where the cowboys at<br/>
Where the brown blast black <br/>
And the black blast right back<br/>
That's a fact in the city where I'm from<br/>
You betta get ready<br/>
Caus here they kitty come cum<br/>
Nigga we can dumb on your bitchass<br/>
I ain't trippin caus I'm from the oldschool<br/>
And I never hesita to blast<br/>

You gotta beginnin to win<br/>
Holla back nigga in 20 minutes<br/>

<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Gimme your mic and watch me brake these niggas<br/>
How they figga<br/>
Bustas get shot tryin to plot<br/>
Blew the dice hit them twice hit a seven<br/>
Now Snoop watch me trip when I back your eleven<br/>
Mix for licks to double my chips <br/>
Some bangers so much I got cheers even go to there<br/>
Now back up and watch me stack up my dirt<br/>
I steal like G'z when you woke up and it hurt<br/>
Watch me try matches no need for no practice<br/>
Fuck around and get straight stoned with the package<br/>
Dogg get the weed bangin <br/>
How the homies feel <br/>
If me and you left here for hangin<br/>
I feel like givin it up<br/>
Caus I'm a young nigga livin it up<br/>
Me and Snoop ain't give a fuck<br/>

You know I respresent the eastside Long Beach with the crip nigga<br/>
