<i>[Akon:]</i> Convict...Music...and you know we a front.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Akon):]</i><br/>
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole,<br/>
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know<br/>
I wanna fuck you, you already know<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Money in the air as more feel grab you by your coat tail take you to the motel, hoe sale,<br/>
don't tell, won't tell, baby said I don't talk Dogg but she told on me, oh well,<br/>
take a picture with me, what the flick gonna do, baby stick to me &amp; I'mma stick on you,<br/>
if you pick me then I'mma pick on you, d-o-double g and I'm here to put this dick on you,<br/>
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right, wrip riding them poles and them doors is tight<br/>
and I'mma get me a shot for the end of the night 'cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Akon)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
Shorty I can see you ain't lonely handful of niggas and they all got cheese,<br/>
so you looking at me now what's it gonna be just another tease far as I can see,<br/>
trying get you up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs,<br/>
throwing bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cause I'm far from a scrub,<br/>
you know my pedigree, ex-dealer use to move phetamines,<br/>
girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Akon)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Mobbin' through club in low pressing I'm sitting in the back in the smokers section (just smoking),<br/>
birds eye, I got a clear view, you cant see me but I can see you (baby I see you),<br/>
it's cool we jet the mood is set,<br/>
your pussy is wet you rubbing your back and touching your neck,<br/>
your body is movin' you humpin' and jumpin' your titties is bouncin' you smilin' and grinin' and looking at me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
Girl and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy,<br/>
baby you got a phatty the type I like to marry wanting to just give you everything and that's kinda scary,<br/>
cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass, bouncin', got me tippin' my glass,<br/>
Normally don't get caught up too fast but I got a thing for you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Akon) x2]</i>
