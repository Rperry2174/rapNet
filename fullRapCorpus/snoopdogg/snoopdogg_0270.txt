<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
6-5-4-3-2-1<br/>
7 Days of Funk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’ll be there for you<br/>
When you need some company<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
Baby, baby, come to me<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
If you need that fire weed<br/>
Let me light that for you<br/>
Can’t you see I’m all you need?<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
<br/>
No talk, it’s all real<br/>
I gotta let you know how I really feel<br/>
Do or die, it’s you and I<br/>
Now have a seat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
Let me get you to the funk baby<br/>
Let me get you to the funk girl<br/>
Let me get you to the funk baby<br/>
Let me get you to the funk girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’ll be there for you<br/>
When you need some company<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
Baby, baby, come to me<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
If you need that fire weed<br/>
Let me light that for you<br/>
Can’t you see I’m all you need?<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Think I’ve had enough<br/>
But it’s a must I find my way back to the funk<br/>
High and low which way she go<br/>
Can someone please let a G know?<br/>
Boosy Collins, George Dew<br/>
James Brown and uncle Jam’s troops<br/>
George Clinton, the atomic dog<br/>
24 track mixed in analog<br/>
Can’t a dog just be on a tree<br/>
I’m a blind man so I see, I see<br/>
6 lines with strings to attach<br/>
2-12 homies to match the hippie uh<br/>
Sell a quick load<br/>
And now I’m walking on a yellow brick road, funk mode<br/>
Do or die, it’s you and I<br/>
Now have a seat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
Let me get you to the funk baby<br/>
Let me get you to the funk girl<br/>
Let me get you to the funk baby<br/>
Let me get you to the funk girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’ll be there for you<br/>
When you need some company<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
Baby, baby, come to me<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
If you need that fire weed<br/>
Let me light that for you<br/>
Can’t you see I’m all you need?<br/>
Right there for you<br/>
<br/>
I’ll be there for you
