Aw yeah, coming to you live and direct from the LBC<br/>
We have the one and only, Snoop D-O double G<br/>
Yeah, yeah, drop it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[scratching]</i><br/>
It's the one and only D-O double G<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg, it's the one and only<br/>
The one and only, D-O double-double-double G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Big Snoop Dogg<br/>
You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star<br/>
I push up laid back in a black car<br/>
Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that<br/>
I came up hard as hell, check it out<br/>
I stayed sharp and played my part<br/>
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart<br/>
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time<br/>
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding<br/>
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail<br/>
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit<br/>
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening<br/>
That's about the time I put down the rocks<br/>
And got to working in the studio around the clock<br/>
For a small profit, but a whole lot of game<br/>
Man I'm famous, now it ain't the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's the one and only D-O double G<br/>
Do you want some of this<br/>
Top Dogg bite em all, yeah I'm burning it up<br/>
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg<br/>
You tuned in to the number one<br/>
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four<br/>
So get real fool, fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Local boy made good over night shit<br/>
Not only am I getting righteous but wise see<br/>
I paid the price, with consecutive platinum hits<br/>
I up my status, aint no more Calvin Broadus<br/>
World on my shoulder, but I can handle it<br/>
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder<br/>
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover<br/>
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother<br/>
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up<br/>
Best kept secret so I'm want up<br/>
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7<br/>
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven<br/>
Now all I need is a push in the right direction<br/>
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks<br/>
And now the game ain't stopping<br/>
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping<br/>
Started off young as a little-bitty buck<br/>
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire<br/>
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit<br/>
I worked hard as a motherfucker<br/>
Fuck Cuzz, and him too cause all y'all suckas<br/>
Now with the savvy of a business man<br/>
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying<br/>
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock<br/>
Big Dizzel knocking down your block<br/>
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process<br/>
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed<br/>
It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man<br/>
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again<br/>
And these here are the files of a classic<br/>
It's my throne till I choose to pass it<br/>
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright<br/>
That's why I wear my yellow C's at night nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
