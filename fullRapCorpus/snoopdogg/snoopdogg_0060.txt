<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You got yo' thang, and I got mine<br/>
You see, I can give it to you like all the time<br/>
If you, gimme them digits let me holla at you baby<br/>
Stop playin games, let's do this damn thang<br/>
Cause you the whole thang, with the candles and the ice<br/>
and then the champagne, whoot wham bing bing bang bang!<br/>
Now, what's love got to do with this?<br/>
Cause if you cool with this I'm through with this<br/>
Baby is we doin this?<br/>

Somethin about yo' business, I really don't understand<br/>
But if you keep on teasin me girl, I'm gon' change your plan<br/>
<br/>
I know when you'll change your mind;<br/>
that's when your rent is due (when your rent is due)<br/>
and you're many months behind<br/>
How's that to treat your friend<br/>
with that attitude.. you can leave it all behind<br/>
<br/>
Somethin about yo' business, I really don't understand<br/>
But if you keep on teasin me girl, I'm gon' be your man<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You say that you don't, you say that you won't<br/>
I think that you will, cause girl I'm way too real<br/>
And every girl need a G, and we see G<br/>
I saw you lookin at me, when I was with Warren G<br/>
You peepin not speakin and that's freakin me out<br/>
It's somethin bout yo bidness baby and it's flippin me out<br/>
I really can't understand why it's so easy, for you to tease me<br/>
'Fore it's over, you'll be Miss Snoop Deezy<br/>
