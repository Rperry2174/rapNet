<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Those girls, those girls)<br/>
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me<br/>
I was just playin' the game<br/>
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I got a call from this hoe the other day<br/>
She say she just moved down from The Bay<br/>
to L.A. - well that's great<br/>
We should sit down and talk face to face<br/>
You bring the barbeque, I got the paper plates<br/>
I can't lie girl, I like the way you shake<br/>
And when you dance the way you make your booty shake<br/>
Give or take, I rate you 'bout an eight<br/>
Or a nine - okay, fine, you a dime<br/>
And them other bitches they gon' wait in line<br/>
They hatin' on you how you take away they shine<br/>
Rewind, pay attention to the signs<br/>
I see money when I look you in the eyes<br/>
No lie, I love how you stay fly<br/>
So fly, send a text and I'll reply<br/>
And when you need that good sex, I'm the guy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)<br/>
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me<br/>
I was just playin' the game<br/>
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
It was Kim, Dalesa, Vanessa, Rene<br/>
I don't love hoes or respect what they say<br/>
Hey... yeah that's life<br/>
The Pound comin' through, get the F out the way<br/>
I know it's been a minute but your boy been away<br/>
It feels so good, take me back in the day<br/>
I hit the studio, then back to the stage<br/>
The lights come on and the people start to wave<br/>
Then I seen this girl, she looked me right in the face<br/>
Like "I know you remember me and my homegirl Tanay"<br/>
We stay downtown in a loft on Santa Fe<br/>
And we your number one biggest fans to this day<br/>
Wait... baby girl I'm the great<br/>
Bigg Snoop Dogg, you got to bring me up to date<br/>
I know a lot of girls rock shows in many states<br/>
Room 220, bring your friend and some drank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)<br/>
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me<br/>
I was just playin' the game<br/>
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now where you gonna find a nigga fresh like me bitch?<br/>
Somebody pass the lighter so I can get this weed lit<br/>
She lookin' at my stones like "Damn, is he rich?"<br/>
I'm lookin' at her pose like damn is she thick<br/>
Fuck them other dudes, I'm the man to be with<br/>
Fifty million sold, who's bigger than me bitch?<br/>
Nobody, let me put you on to some G shit<br/>
Hop in the Benz, I'll get you higher than ski lifts<br/>
And then I'm bout to beat the cat up like Heathcliff<br/>
Yeah, 'cause all bitches need dick<br/>
And if they say they don't they just lyin', they wanna sit<br/>
shotgun in the 500 like she the shit<br/>
Uh-uh, hold on baby, we the shit<br/>
Clear blue skies, dip 'til you're seasick<br/>
You're with the one and only<br/>
S, yes, N, double, O, P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Those girls, those girls, those girls, those girls)<br/>
Those girls, they don't mean a thing to me<br/>
I was just playin' the game<br/>
It was all a fantasy (Those girls)
