<i>[Hook: Bruno Mars]</i><br/>
So what we get drunk?<br/>
So what we smoke weed?<br/>
We’re just having fun<br/>
We don’t care who sees<br/>
So what we go out?<br/>
That’s how its supposed to be<br/>
Living young and wild and free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?<br/>
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show<br/>
Keep it real with my niggas<br/>
Keep it player for these hoes<br/>
And look clean don't it?<br/>
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it<br/>
Give me some 501 jeans on it<br/>
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers<br/>
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers<br/>
You a class clown and if I skip for the day<br/>
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You know what?<br/>
It’s like I’m 17 again<br/>
Peach fuzz on my face<br/>
Lookin’, on the case<br/>
Tryna find a hella taste<br/>
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy<br/>
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it<br/>
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away<br/>
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay<br/>
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint<br/>
Up front, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
And I don't even care<br/>
Cause if me and my team in there<br/>
There's gonna be some weed in the air<br/>
Tell 'em Mac<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'<br/>
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
That's how it should be done<br/>
Soon as you thinkin' you're down<br/>
Find how to turn things around<br/>
Now things are lookin' up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang<br/>
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'<br/>
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building<br/>
Got my own car, no job, no children<br/>
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me<br/>
This is us, we gon' fuss<br/>
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll<br/>
And live off life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yea, roll one, smoke one<br/>
When you live like this you’re supposed to party<br/>
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun<br/>
So we just, roll one, smoke one<br/>
When you live like this you’re supposed to party<br/>
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
