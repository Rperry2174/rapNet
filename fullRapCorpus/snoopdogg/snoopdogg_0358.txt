<i>[Chorus - Snoop Dogg (Craig Robinson):]</i><br/>
Girl you know you get me off<br/>
Girl, it's nothing to a boss<br/>
Give it to ya nice and soft<br/>
Take your panties off...<br/>
(You are beautiful, you are wonderful)<br/>
(I adore you, I appreciate you)<br/>
Girl I'm off this alcohol, leaning up against the wall<br/>
Put your hands up on my balls<br/>
And take your panties off...<br/>
(You are beautiful, you are wonderful)<br/>
Slip 'em to the side, girl (I adore you)<br/>
Let me slip inside, girl (I appreciate you)<br/>
(She is your queen, she is my diva)<br/>
Take your panties off (she is my queen)<br/>
Slip 'em to the side, girl (she is my diva)<br/>
Let me slip inside, girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Craig Robinson:]</i><br/>
The problem that I seem to have<br/>
Each and every time I try<br/>
To break down what I'm thinking<br/>
Girl, you know you got my eye<br/>
I gotta see what's under there<br/>
I gotta take my time too<br/>
So come on, baby, come tonight<br/>
And please take off your panties too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Craig Robinson:]</i><br/>
Somebody told me one time, ask<br/>
Ask and you shall receive<br/>
So this is me being very polite<br/>
Take your panties off, please<br/>
First you say yes, and then you say no<br/>
And we ain't goin' tit for tat<br/>
You might think that, you being cute<br/>
But baby, ain't nobody got time for that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Pancakes and that NESQUIK<br/>
Mouth full of that lipstick<br/>
Play your cards right<br/>
And you just might get yourself that dipstick<br/>
Lick me, lick me, lick me up<br/>
And you can lick me down<br/>
And let me slip it in, and let me take you down<br/>
Damn, girl, understand, girl<br/>
Your panties look better on the floor<br/>
So me a favour, misbehaviour<br/>
Let 'em go, let 'em go<br/>
Leave your panties on the dresser<br/>
Muchacha...<br/>
Bad girl, now lift your dress up<br/>
Sexy-ass girl, and I'm your professor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Craig Robinson:]</i><br/>
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...<br/>
Take 'em off...<br/>
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...<br/>
Take 'em off...<br/>
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...<br/>
Take 'em off...<br/>
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off...<br/>
Take 'em off...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
What is a king without a queen?<br/>
What is the ding, without the ding-a-ling?<br/>
It all matters, it's one thing<br/>
With you pulling those panties down<br/>
So, no time to waste - this is the place<br/>
You're forced to so something you've always wanted to<br/>
So take 'em off...
