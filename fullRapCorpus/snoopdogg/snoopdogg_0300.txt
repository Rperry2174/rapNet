<i>[Snoop Dogg &amp; Gwen Stefani:]</i><br/>
Let's forget where we are and what's goin' on<br/>
Let's forget who we are and who we know<br/>
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?<br/>
Come on baby we can escape, run away with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus - Snoop Dogg (Gwen Stefani):]</i><br/>
You like the way that I dress (you love the way that I see)<br/>
You love the things that I do (yes but I love that you are free)<br/>
You love the way I think (for people everywhere)<br/>
We're approaching the brink but who cares<br/>
The world is getting ablaze, yea (x2)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Snoop Dogg &amp; Gwen Stefani:]</i><br/>
Run away, run away with me<br/>
Come and play, come and play with me<br/>
Run away, yes do the day with me<br/>
Let's escape, yes do the day with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg &amp; Gwen Stefani:]</i><br/>
Let's forget who we were and wanted to be<br/>
Let's forget who was there, trust me please<br/>
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?<br/>
They won't put their guns away, run away with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg &amp; Gwen Stefani:]</i><br/>
I don't understand why do they live so violently<br/>
Let's get closer to the sun, where we're meant to be<br/>
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?<br/>
Come on baby no time to waste, run away with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
