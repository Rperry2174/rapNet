<i>[Intro skit]</i><br/>
<i>[Wiz]</i> I been trying to develop an alternative fuel<br/>
from a mix of all natural substances.<br/>
But the mix was highly volatile until we find a catalyst<br/>
to help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel.<br/>
(I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?)<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Marijuana motherfucker!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes<br/>
Teachers, staff and students<br/>
I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show<br/>
Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa Premium Rolling Papers<br/>
And the qualified rollers of Snoop Dogg Master Kush<br/>
So without further adieux, let's get this show on the road<br/>
First contestant, bring your talent to the foreground<br/>
and let your smoke be yo' background<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Every time I go out, I'm blowin the smoke out<br/>
I buy it don't even know the price<br/>
I smoke cause I live it, don't pay me to visit<br/>
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky<br/>
My nigga it's 'bout to go dowwwwwn<br/>
Ohh we fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die<br/>
I'ma get up in this hoe's houuuuuse<br/>
Roll one up, clean the ride case them hoes wan' jump inside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uhh, got a joint filled with quality shit<br/>
My bottom bitch smokin with me, niggaz talk shit<br/>
All of 'em shrimp (hehe) I'm a big fish<br/>
Roll a joint, lick it once, tell you hit this, groupies on my dick<br/>
Several kush is on my hitlist, in and out these niggaz bitches<br/>
Smokin tree and not to mention hustlin, tryin to mind my business<br/>
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skippin<br/>
Yeah I hear what they sayin, just be too high to listen<br/>
'Bout my money trippin, if I even fold it wrong<br/>
Ya ain't smokin this good, if it's foul tell you I sold it all<br/>
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all<br/>
Or say fuck it and cuff it 'til I go smoke with Dogg<br/>
I show off, I show off, I show off<br/>
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off<br/>
Keep the money comin in and the papers rolled up<br/>
And ain't worried 'bout a hatin nigga, they get no love (ohh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I go green like I was Archbishop Don Juan<br/>
And blow circles 'round you suckas like a marathon<br/>
My gym teacher told me, but I didn't listen<br/>
My bitch did my homework and now I'm in detention<br/>
It sho' beats suspension, this is my audition<br/>
So play yo' position, get the picture I envision<br/>
Did she mention, Snoop Dogg was made for kissin<br/>
A barricuda fishin, she on a mission for me<br/>
Pleasure, pain and glory, and my inventory<br/>
My SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me<br/>
And now we prancin on stage at the talent show<br/>
We floss in my clothes, my chain and my knapsack<br/>
Full of that, hand me that, can you see my telescope<br/>
Principle, said she wanna see me cause she smell my smoke<br/>
'Bout my money trippin even if I fold it wrong<br/>
Blowin zones with Wiz cause this is the protocol<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Archbishop Don "Magic" Juan]</i><br/>
Yeah, it's the Archbishop Don "Magic" Juan<br/>
It's a talent show, and everybody got to know<br/>
You got to be ready so you don't have to get ready<br/>
So when I stepped in, for the talent show<br/>
I had stole the show, because I was already ready<br/>
Everybody shoulda know they part<br/>
because the whole world is the stage, and everybody play a part<br/>
So when you at the talent show, you got to know yo' part<br/>
And you got to know when to move, and when not to move<br/>
And by me being a famous player, and know my game<br/>
I took the talent show, because I had style<br/>
I had flash, I had originality!<br/>
I had me, and that's what it's all about!<br/>
When you doin a talent show, you got to be you!<br/>
Green for the money, gold for the honey<br/>
I'm the original... <i>[fades out]</i>
