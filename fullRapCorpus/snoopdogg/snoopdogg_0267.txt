<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Faden away<br/>
And I can't go another day<br/>
You make it hard to stay away<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
And ain't no other words to say<br/>
You make it hard for me to stay<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
Faden Away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
In my mind, it's all about you<br/>
I don't know what to do<br/>
Cuz you have got me confused<br/>
We talking on the phone<br/>
We fussing fight you ‘bout that lightening<br/>
I just wanna love you right, love you right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Faden away<br/>
And I can't go another day<br/>
You make it hard to stay away<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
And ain't no other words to say<br/>
You make it hard for me to stay<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
Faden Away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Make time, make love, that’s what we make<br/>
Looking nowadays, looking like it’s gonna fade<br/>
See me, will you see here G soul<br/>
If he lose baby he gonna gain another dough<br/>
What a brother know, keep it on the low<br/>
That’s what my grandma said it suppose to go<br/>
Feel the same, we toast and post it<br/>
And if it all work soft then we casper the ghost<br/>
Me and damn phone we capture the phone<br/>
Collusion, illusion, set it all foe<br/>
Plan with me, for your best, let it all go<br/>
The beach and the wind you blow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
Faden away<br/>
And I can't go another day<br/>
You make it hard to stay away<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
And ain't no other words to say<br/>
You make it hard for me to stay<br/>
Girl you've got me faden away<br/>
Faden Away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
It’s so hard to stay with you girl<br/>
It’s even harder to play with you girl<br/>
It’s so hard to stay with you girl<br/>
And even harder to play with you girl<br/>
Faden away<br/>
Faden away<br/>
Faden away<br/>
Faden away<br/>
Faden away<br/>
Faden away<br/>
Faden away
