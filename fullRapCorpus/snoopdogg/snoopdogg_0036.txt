<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
I get up early in the mourning and begin my mission<br/>
Brush my teeth then I creeps to the kitchen<br/>
Cook some bacon and eggs and put some braids in my head<br/>
Stash this pound, put the shit down then I head<br/>
To the spot thats hot, fuck a fed<br/>

Im taking penitentiary  chances, dancin with the devil<br/>
Im in it to win it for No Limit nigga next level<br/>
A whole lot of y'all niggas out there walk around dead here take this <br/>

<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
They say money is the key to end all your woes<br/>
Thats probably why I love it and cant stand them hoes<br/>

And pack a nine all the time and thats for all my enimies<br/>

I'm way down south in a house and I'm bangin this shit<br/>
I got gold around my neck that will never ever fade<br/>
Rolex watch on my wrist nigga getting paid<br/>
