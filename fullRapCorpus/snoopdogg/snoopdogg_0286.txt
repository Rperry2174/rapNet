Lose flash at eleven, eighty six box from the one they seven<br/>
New in Denver they beat the bust for ever<br/>
One call and make all your relatives forever<br/>
Plus your clowns sound funny, it's the deep out honey<br/>
Smash with a crash makwe you dash sound funny<br/>
So how the motherfucke you gonna pick your lips<br/>
To disrespect truth when I run with crips<br/>
And that move I know so un cut with it<br/>
If you ain't from the lane you never really did it<br/>
Pull it, five might make you call<br/>
And he burn your sould like stop dropping roll<br/>
And I've be there, I've done that, play it loud<br/>
Fall back motherfuckers get it off my could<br/>
Poof cush what a cuff that's the truth<br/>
When you smelling all the wide<br/>
Make it sure you crufed<br/>
Smach down we play no crack now<br/>
Off the blunt, sort of like crack down<br/>
Anywhere I please to fill, hop back into the way never see to drift<br/>
Capital weex stay screaming and use the mess<br/>
I scream no doubt, I spell the rest out<br/>
Into the O-O p that's way<br/>
Johnny low on my bumper like see your side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
If you came here to bunty let me know it<br/>
But that don't mean this time just start to show it baby<br/>
<br/>
Suddly you use the purpose, still will shut this down<br/>
Better move fast and catch it the nerve there<br/>
All guessed up from the kimped team blast<br/>
Black white fast, then leave you in the trash<br/>
Brain lay like truck please believ where you bump<br/>
West side it's the truck all we do is jump<br/>
At they point where you from don't matter<br/>
And all that gatters, gatters are gun doubetr<br/>
I sold you no limite boy grow on stable<br/>
Walk down but now remove now he rush the lable<br/>
You run your mouth that means you ain't able<br/>
Slaim diamonds then brak you brake your whole table<br/>
So ugly means muggy<br/>
But that 22 shoos on a brand new buggy<br/>
And that costy but money get main<br/>
Long be, sit with like leats to make it fame<br/>
So patch it if you want it, I suggest you post on it<br/>
Cuz when it's tured up fall back don't do me<br/>
We make it back ok drop it like it's hot<br/>
And bangel dummy, just cuz I might stop it if you not<br/>
Blue blazes, new faces, aliens from other space<br/>
Get bean from the laces<br/>
Terradectacal move doww, get you done<br/>
So again I'mma show you how to wrestle with one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hold on from scatter, that's be AC<br/>
Pull my stuned, shape on, better I see they stress<br/>
Cacth me back at AP-s zipping OI, so OG holly moly<br/>
Uncut that's how we ment it<br/>
Simply rollie in the text and send it<br/>
Check your imbox just now it's been block<br/>
Unorder wax tell her that gonna rocks<br/>
Let's move down like we're the fool<br/>
Let's patch the fool and chase the moon<br/>
All over the floor like round over lower<br/>
When he walk over here, simply meens it's over<br/>
Ooh just so you know put a sing on your door cuz he close the store<br/>
Plus he stay on, I'm like there he go<br/>
It I known it matter<br/>
Still here for ever, that mean you still splat<br/>
She refuse me he might explode<br/>
Then all over the roof cuz still we get to<br/>
We both fliping to flow smooth<br/>
Damn ball skippin to cost room<br/>
Not much to say after cuz when you go then not coming back
