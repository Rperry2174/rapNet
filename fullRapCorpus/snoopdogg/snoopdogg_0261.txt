<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Is it because I'm black?<br/>
Somebody tell me, what can I do?<br/>
(Cause their ain't enough bars<br/>
To hold the the drama that we've been through)<br/>
<br/>
Right here, right now, I do declare<br/>
That I'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player<br/>
I swear I ain't never told on nobody<br/>
It started in '82 at a 'hood house party<br/>
Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D<br/>
Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC<br/>
Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park<br/>
I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips<br/>
I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K<br/>
Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty<br/>
Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East<br/>
Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change<br/>
So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'<br/>
I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man<br/>
Try my best to rewrite this plan<br/>
As-salamu alaykum, sir<br/>
Yeah, that's the plan...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm down with Obama just to add a little drama<br/>
And I'm rollin' with the Nation, but I've been doin' that<br/>
Had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that I'mma<br/>
Make a change, and she said: "baby, go ahead and do that"<br/>
Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it cause he show it<br/>
And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace<br/>
What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along<br/>
They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us<br/>
Haters...<br/>
<br/>
The enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live<br/>
<br/>
