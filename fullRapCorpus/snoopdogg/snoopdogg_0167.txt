I got a penthouse in Manhattan <br/>
Two more in Malibu <br/>
I bought an 87 Cadillac Seville <br/>
I got a Maserati too<br/>
I wear diamonds on my fingers <br/>
A couple on my toes,<br/>
I wear the finest cologne money can buy<br/>
It keeps me smellin’ like a rose<br/>
If u wonderin’ how I do it<br/>
There’s just one simple rule...I’m just cool (cool)<br/>
Honey baby cant you see...I’m just cool (cool) <br/>
Aint nobody bad like me<br/>
what’s that spell? (C-O-O-L)<br/>
what’s the spell? (C-O-O-L)<br/>
I might dine in San Francisco<br/>
Dance all night in Rome<br/>
I go any freakin’ place I want to<br/>
And my lear jet brings me home<br/>
I got ladies by the dozen<br/>
I got money by the ton<br/>
Just aint nobody better <br/>
Heaven knows that I’m the one<br/>
Its all because of something<br/>
That I didn’t learn in school,<br/>
Im just cool (cool)<br/>
Honey baby cant you see...I’m soo cool (cool) <br/>
Aint nobody bad like me<br/>
what’s that spell? (C-O-O-L)<br/>
what’s that spell? (C-O-O-L)<br/>
and im cool im just cool (cool,cool,cool)<br/>
im just cool im just cool cool cool<br/>
when I look into the mirror <br/>
theres just something I already know<br/>
im just cool(cool)<br/>
Honey baby cant you see...I’m just cool (cool) <br/>
Aint nobody bad like me<br/>
Spell it (C-O-O-L)<br/>
Whats that spell? (C-O-O-L) cool <br/>
Sing it baby cool<br/>
Whats that spell? (cool)
