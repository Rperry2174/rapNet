<i>[Daft Punk Sample:]</i><br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Catch us in M.I.A<br/>
Cleveland and Dallas<br/>
We be European, D-P-Gin' in malice<br/>
Roll up the best dro, we here now<br/>
Turn up, when you get down<br/>
Roll call, all my dogs, spent 10 G's at the strip mall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz Dillinger:]</i><br/>
Round and round we go<br/>
Where we stop, no-one will know<br/>
Baby it's <i>[?]</i> Austria, Beli <i>[?]</i> Tokyo<br/>
Then I, spin the globe, putting my fingers on it<br/>
Like a G-6, pop a <i>[?]</i> flight then I'm <i>[?]</i> on it<br/>
Then I zoom straight to <i>[?]</i> UK, Belgium, then back to France<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daft Punk Sample:]</i><br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
It was all on you, now it's all on me<br/>
All around the world, this is volume three<br/>
Me and my cousin, D-A-Z<br/>
Ain't too many spots that we don't be<br/>
Mad when I play us <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cute lil' Egyptian, met her in Arabia<br/>
Mad when a nigga stop paging her<br/>
I had to let her know, I ain't saving ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz:]</i><br/>
You know, we know the flight's shit<br/>
Strap it/traffic<i>[?]</i> ten s with the flyest beach<br/>
In Dubai, you know we don't <i>[?]</i> smoking, we high<br/>
And then we fly over to the states with the cars we drive<br/>
And then we end up at the leopard nine (everyday)<br/>
This guy <i>[?]</i> gon' party like all day long<br/>
Who gon' tell him when we end up next?<br/>
<i>[?]</i> beach cmon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daft Punk Sample:]</i><br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg (Daz Dillinger):]</i><br/>
All around the world babe<br/>
(All around the world babe)<br/>
People say the same things<br/>
People say they on they own<br/>
(People say they on they own)<br/>
But they do the same<br/>
(But they do the same thing)<br/>
All around the world mayne<br/>
(All around the world mayne)<br/>
Everything's the same game<br/>
People say they on they own<br/>
But they do the same thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daft Punk Sample:]</i><br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
Around the world, around the world<br/>
