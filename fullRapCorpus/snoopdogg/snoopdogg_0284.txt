Lay low, getting' this weed money, me and my cous'<br/>
Yeah, you know how we do<br/>
But I wanna hold that baby for a minute now<br/>
See, about to knock 'er<br/>
See what it takes for her to be knocked<br/>
What it is, trip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - x2:]</i><br/>
Baby, what's yo' pleasure?<br/>
I be there for you, baby!<br/>
Even through stormy weather<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz Dillinger:]</i><br/>
Huh, what did you prefer, let me accommodate<br/>
To get you turned up, to get your head straight<br/>
We started off with a quote, and now it's about an eighth<br/>
When you and Ali back, I blow it in ya face<br/>
I could tell that you high because you laughing<br/>
You took a dab of that wax girl, you blasting<br/>
She wants some cake in her system, she take a shot of that<br/>
Moscato with the lemon, yeah, with a shot of yeah<br/>
Man, that's a hell of a combination, put you on your back<br/>
She take three more shots, I said you dig that?<br/>
Now she in the mood tonight to get freaky<br/>
I can tell that she buzzing, she getting kinky<br/>
Yes, she loving <i>[?]</i> she take a dab<br/>
Its me and one girl and Snoop in dial<i>[?]</i><br/>
Hit the stormy weather, yeah, it's fifty below<br/>
We in a smoke storm, baby, light it up and let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
See, that's why we push it<br/>
And go faster<br/>
Tell me how to get it on<br/>
If you got the septic on the phone<br/>
We go and smoke it off to this door?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shon La Won:]</i><br/>
Girl I wanna smoke wit ya<br/>
You wanna smoke wit me<br/>
The first time I'm feelin out your fantasy<br/>
It's the man in me<br/>
And the woman in you<br/>
To make us do the things we do<br/>
We got something in common<br/>
I don't know what it is<br/>
We can be lost or we can be free<br/>
Now I did like many ladies in my day<br/>
But just like the smoke, they got blown away<br/>
Like a glass of wine, sit back and rewind<br/>
But back into time, let the feeling rewind<br/>
Now, I don't know what it is and I don't know what it was<br/>
But it's DPG, me and my big cuz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
