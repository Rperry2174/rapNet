<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I knew that, I knew that<br/>
You were lookin' at me<br/>
That's when the blunt <i>[?]</i><br/>
I knew that, I knew that<br/>
You would leave your spot when you got hot<br/>
And you're goin' again<br/>
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom<br/>
Got 5 minutes to exchange them buds<br/>
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign<br/>
I know your name, it must be under cover<br/>
<br/>
Went out tonight, I think of my life<br/>
I'm sick and tired of rouge, yea<br/>
Then, threw caution to the wind cause F it, who cares<br/>
So tonight I'm gon' be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
Riding on your, riding on your<br/>
Riding on your wave girl<br/>
And I feel like, ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Thinkin' to myself if I was a freaky dink<br/>
What's crackin' homie?<br/>
Ain't you ain't gonna see me in this club next week, no<br/>
So tonight' I'm gon' be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that you rest and you don't need to sleep<br/>
Don't be slacking homie<br/>
Grab me by the proof so I don't miss a beat<br/>
Baby, so tonight I'm gon' be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
