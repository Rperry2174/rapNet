Every dog has his day<br/>
Another thirty nine inch thick classic (yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah)<br/>
Girl, as i sit here thinking to myself <br/>
There is no one for you but me, and i mean that<br/>
And i think about all the things we've been through <br/>
Like arguing and fighting for example<br/>
You know the love we have for each other <br/>
It tends to out weigh what do to another <br/>
Ya know my granddaddy use to always say <br/>
Ya know he used to say it like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns<br/>
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe<br/>
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns<br/>
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe<br/>
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns<br/>
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe<br/>

What up motherfuckers? this is snoop dogg<br/>
Im trying to figure out how the fuck im gonna do y'all<br/>
Hanging with my homie from the turf, thats young q-ball<br/>
Giving me the word from the street, heres the scoop y'all<br/>
The niggaz from the eastsidaz split up (split up)<br/>
And one of 'em tried to fuck yo' shit up (what?)<br/>
Naw cuz, dont believe that, thats my nigga for life<br/>
Im out with the bullshit, im in wuth the real shit<br/>
Im at the church doing work, spittin game from the pulpit<br/>
Now thats the bidness, and god is my witness<br/>
L-B-C-2-1-3 hell yeah, we in this<br/>
Its so relentless, and all my dogs up against the life sentence<br/>
I love y'all, like i love no bitch, and thats real shit<br/>
Or some CRIP shit, homie dig this<br/>

<i>[verse]</i><br/>
I used to have a lot broads that i doont fool with<br/>
I used to have a lot of homeboys i aint cool with<br/>
A lotpeople that a nigga used to go to school with <br/>
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin it <br/>
But what none of them would believe though (what?)<br/>
That i would be bigger the kurtis blow <br/>
I guess he was right, these are the breaks<br/>
Despite my mistakes and aches, im gettin' cake <br/>
To realize your fate through faith, (through faith)<br/>
Cause we all gonna get that day (for what)<br/>
To see if our lives was straight<br/>
And to see if we gonna walk through thosse pearly gates (yeah?)<br/>
To see the man upstairs, on some real talk homie<br/>
I'm tired of being stuck here <br/>
If i could i would fly to the moon (zoom)<br/>
Y'all probably think im trippin off deeze mushrooms (i know)<br/>

Now as i think back to the words my granddaddy used to say <br/>
I never seen him in church, but he always had the word<br/>
He would always tell me! sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad <br/>
You gotta do bad in order to do good
