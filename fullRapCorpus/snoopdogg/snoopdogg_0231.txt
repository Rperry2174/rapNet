<i>[Hook x2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Have a little party at my crib<br/>
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is<br/>
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke<br/>
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Young nigga that's more famous than these older niggas<br/>
Young nigga got my game up from these older niggas<br/>
Motherfuckas hear my name, I say I told you nigga<br/>
I was taught to count my paper 'fore I fold it nigga<br/>
Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga<br/>
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it with ya<br/>
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember<br/>
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender<br/>
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner<br/>
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender<br/>
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for<br/>
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor<br/>
And all about this chronic leaf is what in for<br/>
So give your parents my apology for me again or<br/>
Get high like we Cheech and Chong<br/>
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs<br/>
Roll up so we can all...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Killer Cali is what we blow<br/>
OG nigga from way down low<br/>
Known for banging the blue C rag<br/>
Started off smoking nothing but Zags<br/>
Popping P's, chopping trees<br/>
501's, all of these<br/>
All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me<br/>
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television<br/>
Table full of vegetation so you just might stun a nigga<br/>
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be<br/>
East Side Long Beach where I'm from<br/>
Bring your girls, all y'all come<br/>
Give me some, now give her some<br/>
It's big Mac, I love to have fun<br/>
You are, you are the one<br/>
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1<br/>
Break it down, lay it down<br/>
Baby work that body like<br/>
At the pad, acting bad<br/>
Baby what that party like?<br/>
Moving so schizophrenic<br/>
Baby pull down your panties<br/>
Let the Doggy Dog ram it<br/>
I cram to undertsand it<br/>
Back room that's my bedroom<br/>
Make her right up in it<br/>
Close the door, smoke, oh fo sho<br/>
I'm 'bout to slide up in it<br/>
Smoke something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Curren$y]</i><br/>
Having money and blowing hella chronic<br/>
Smoke I'm stunting<br/>
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running<br/>
Sounding like a dinosaur empty stomach rumbling <br/>
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming<br/>
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner<br/>
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb<br/>
Stuffing kush in Raw cones, playing Megaman 3<br/>
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami<br/>
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family<br/>
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing<br/>
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston<br/>
So why get caught up<br/>
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up<br/>
In sewing circles with them hoes<br/>
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole<br/>
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed<br/>
<br/>
