<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
This one right here is dedicated to a lot of famous players out there<br/>
That might have been in love before<br/>
I know some of you might not think gangstas fall in love (I miss that bitch)<br/>
But uh, it's true<br/>
If you been in love like I been in love before, you know<br/>
It's hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch)<br/>
It's hard to replace that special someone<br/>
When they just up and you know<br/>
Dip dive and so socialize<br/>
And what we gon do right here (I miss that bitch)<br/>
We go'n kick something over this HiTek beat right here<br/>
For all the players that lost somebody special<br/>
And wonder where she at<br/>
E. White kick that shit (I miss that bitch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E. White]</i><br/>
I got my eyes wide open<br/>
The whole time I'm holding on to hope with you on my mind<br/>
It's been a while child, I'm getting down with Dogg<br/>
I bet my name all around your wall<br/>
Perhaps I went to jail<br/>
That left us out of touch<br/>
Shoulda shot some mail or something<br/>
Ain't no telling where she at now<br/>
I be God damn<br/>
Baby I really wanna see what you got now<br/>
I'm all grown up with my shit together<br/>
I don't know if I'mma see you ever<br/>
I got a woman and shit,but I must admit this<br/>
You at the top of my list<br/>
Unforgetable<br/>
Fuck with them nigga do<br/>
I still miss, there aint no getting rid of you<br/>
But in the mean time I'mma get with cha<br/>
Until I get somebody with your hook up Imma hit ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I miss that bitch<br/>
She was a pot of gold<br/>
Her body was cold<br/>
I don't know where you went<br/>
Where did you go (I miss that bitch)<br/>
Shopping around looking around<br/>
I'm try to see<br/>
Where could you be<br/>
How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
My momma got mad <br/>
I was young when I hooked up with her<br/>
One hit and I couldn't stop trippin<br/>
A long lasting relationship <br/>
Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit<br/>
I used to break you down just to roll you up<br/>
You the real, you never will slow me up<br/>
And you was always on my mind<br/>
Say no more<br/>
I still miss you at times<br/>
All of a sudden you lost my interest<br/>
I packed it up and set about my business<br/>
You used to have a hold on me<br/>
Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me<br/>
I kept going to jail and all that<br/>
Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back<br/>
I guess I had to learn the hard way baby<br/>
I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ohhhhh<br/>
Mary, mary, mary<br/>
Quite contrary<br/>
Ohhhhh<br/>
Every time I think about that girl<br/>
Make a nigga wanna have a wet dream<br/>
Release some steam<br/>
ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhh, ohhhhhh<br/>
I miss that bitch
