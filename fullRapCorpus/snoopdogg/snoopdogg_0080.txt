<i>[Mac Minista]</i><br/>
Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg<br/>
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit<br/>
in the Game Court.  With trumped up charges against<br/>
my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts<br/>
of flexing his G's, popping his P's<br/>
dotting his I's and crossing his T's.<br/>
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit<br/>
in the Game Court.  With trumped up charges against<br/>
my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts<br/>
of verbal and reckless endangerment<br/>
from the million dollar mouthpiece;<br/>
and leaving these super-sap suckers, <br/>
discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice.<br/>
The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit<br/>
in the Game Court.  Charging my client Snoop Dogg, <br/>
Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game.<br/>
Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system.<br/>
Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather, <br/>
bring him before 12 G's and open up his files<br/>
and you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup<br/>
his tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll<br/>
and charge from a hoe to a henchman about his pension.<br/>
So all you jerks with them $11 words<br/>
comin out of your $2 mouth<br/>
about a multi-million dollar Crip<br/>
who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant,<br/>
and the tongue of a mack - I said, <br/>
he's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars<br/>
while you suckers is lookin for stripes.<br/>
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;<br/>
and with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court<br/>
to grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissal.
