<i>[DJ E-Z Dick]</i><br/>
W-Balls, it's your main man DJ E-Z Dick<br/>
About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits<br/>
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets<br/>
We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
A day in the life, of a Rollin 20 Crip<br/>
I'm just a stuburn type of fella with a head like a brick<br/>
And just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless<br/>
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness<br/>
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip<br/>
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip<br/>
I bust a funky composition that's smooth as a prism<br/>
Now check it as I kick off in this funky ass rhythm<br/>
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck<br/>
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set<br/>
Aww nah, Dogg aint this y'all<br/>
I got couple relatives up off of Crenshaw<br/>
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all<br/>
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs<br/>
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Reel, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face<br/>
And the homie Har'ron rest in peace<br/>
Big Jay from Cappinella Park<br/>
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark<br/>
On and on, rocking big neck bone<br/>
Mausberg I had to put you on my song<br/>
It's so real, I had to show some love<br/>
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood<br/>
It's about you bein jealous of what I does<br/>
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast<br/>
in the paint playin post - I back you down<br/>
like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy<br/>
And skirt up, bust ya boulevard<br/>
I'm not Xzibit, you can't +Pull My Hoe Card+<br/>
.. I fucked all your groupies<br/>
When you was doin time in Camp Snoopy<br/>
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches<br/>
And you was payin niggaz off with all my riches<br/>
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?<br/>
Oh I know (bitch!)<br/>
But I walk the mainline everytime I go down<br/>
You can check my G files I do it L.B.C. style<br/>
.. I got the word on your Simon<br/>
You need to just start rhymin<br/>
Cause you the biggest star on your label<br/>
And them other niggaz just crumbs off my table<br/>
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop<br/>
And I still ain't been paid, for "1-8-7 on a cop"<br/>
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit<br/>
if you keep talkin shit on Crip!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
It all boils down to the fact<br/>
that you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)<br/>
It all boils down to the fact<br/>
that you're jealous of my paper stack (gon get pimp slapped)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Money, I get it, paper I got it<br/>
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous<br/>
And I'll be spending money out the anus<br/>
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level<br/>
Man you worser than devils<br/>
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em<br/>
But Ima say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em<br/>
This nigga's a bitch like his wife<br/>
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life<br/>
And I'ma let the whole world see<br/>
Cos you fucked up the industry, and that's on me<br/>
We can go head up, nigga, set it up<br/>
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up<br/>
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up<br/>
Cos I'll fuck every last one of em up, especially Kurupt<br/>
See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up<br/>
He better keep it Crippin, and slip his clip in<br/>
Cos these niggas trippin, this is official business<br/>
Do the same way, leave no witnesses<br/>
This is that unexpected diss directed, sprayed, covered and protected<br/>
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it<br/>
It's all to the good again<br/>
You can catch Snoopy Dibby Double in the hood again<br/>
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit<br/>
To make the whole world feel it<br/>
So put the bacon in the skillet, and try to peel it<br/>
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
Money, I get it, paper I got it<br/>
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em<br/>
Money, I get it, paper I got it<br/>
<br/>
Jealous ass nigga
