Motherfucking legend<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Even if I die, living Legend<br/>
Look at my reflection<br/>
Ain't no second guessing<br/>
Always be a legend<br/>
A motherfucking legend<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Used to whip a Lexus<br/>
I can die right now, still a legend<br/>
Look at my reflection<br/>
Ain't no second guessing<br/>
Born to be a legend<br/>
A motherfucking legend<br/>
<br/>
1996, I beat a 187 (murder was the case)<br/>
80 million sold, and I ain't check the records<br/>
Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me<br/>
Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend<br/>
50 bitches naked<br/>
Nike ain't my preference<br/>
Khaki with the Chucks<br/>
Now look how they dressing<br/>
Perfecting my profession<br/>
Someone call the reverend (Nate Dogg nigga)<br/>
Bury me alive, living legend<br/>
<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Even if I die, living Legend<br/>
Look at my reflection<br/>
Ain't no second guessing<br/>
Always be a legend<br/>
A motherfucking legend<br/>
<br/>
Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me<br/>
You knew niggas look madder than me<br/>
Came up with the doc, been around the world with 'pac<br/>
Don't compare another rapper to me<br/>
When I came and kicked them buildings over<br/>
Swear I always knew I'd never be the same<br/>
Was born to be a motherfucking legend<br/>
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame<br/>
<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
You know what I'm repping<br/>
20 million, 20 years ago<br/>
Cuh, you was like 7<br/>
You ain't gotta like it<br/>
Bitch you gon' respect it (Respek on my name!)<br/>
Look me in my eye<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Even if I die, living Legend<br/>
Look at my reflection<br/>
Ain't no second guessing<br/>
Always be a legend<br/>
A motherfucking legend<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Used to whip a Lexus<br/>
I can die right now, still a legend<br/>
Look at my reflection<br/>
Ain't no second guessing<br/>
Born to be a legend<br/>
A motherfucking legend<br/>
<br/>
Mix purple with the yella<br/>
Kobe with Vanessa<br/>
Did it doggy style<br/>
Like upon the dresser<br/>
Look at my reflection<br/>
Motherfucking legend<br/>
Even when I die
