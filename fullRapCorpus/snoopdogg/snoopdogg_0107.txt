Long hair, wit'cha big fat booty<br/>
Back in the days you was a girl I went to school wit<br/>
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it<br/>
Here to walk wit some pimp-pimp fluid<br/>
Mommy don't worry, I won't abuse it<br/>
Hurry up and finish so we can watch "Clueless" (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
I laugh at these niggas when they ask who do this<br/>
But everybody know who girl that you is<br/>

Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
Homeboy, she taken, just move it<br/>
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it<br/>
We just blow 'dro and keep the flow movin'<br/>
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin' (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
Body rag interior blue, and<br/>
Have them hydralics squeakin' when we screwin'<br/>
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out Snoop, and<br/>
Hootin', hollerin'; hollerin', hootin' (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'<br/>
Hair long and black and curly like you're Cuban<br/>
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'<br/>
And we gon' be together until your moms move in... (Oh-hooo!)<br/>

Ohh why, oh why, oh why, oh why...<br/>

<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in<br/>
You got my pictures on the wall in your room-in (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
Girls be complainin' you keep me boomin'<br/>
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone (Ehh... oh yeah, there's <br/>
something about you...)<br/>
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'<br/>
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you-in (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
You don't ask why I roll wit a crew, and<br/>
Twist up my fingers and wear dark blue-in (Ehh... oh yeah, there's something <br/>
about you...)<br/>
On the eastside, that's the crew I choose<br/>
Nothin' I do is new to you (Oh-hooo!)<br/>
I smack up the world if they rude to you (Ehh...)<br/>
'Cause baby girl you so beautiful...<br/>
