<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
If I do if I don't if I will id I won't<br/>
I mix the C with the P and live the G with the funk<br/>
Got you rapping at school my nigga acting a fool<br/>
He got suspended now he all alone in his room<br/>
Playing my CD la da dee da dee<br/>
East Side shit Goldilocc and big Trey D<br/>
On the <i>[?]</i> the young homie wanna be me<br/>
So I'm a let him I hope the homeboys don't get him<br/>
Cause they gonna sweat him<br/>
Gotta stay on deck for that<br/>
If you a buster you gonna get checked for that<br/>
It's so real homie don't pop that pill<br/>
Dip that now tell me how does that feel<br/>
Can't stop gotta go hard in the paint<br/>
Can't fake nigga put paint where it ain't<br/>
Monkey see monkey do what I say I do<br/>
If I take one you take two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Traci Nelson:]</i><br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Baby girl wanna be grown<br/>
She got a Facebook page and a cell phone<br/>
Her daddy getting money her momma on the go<br/>
She moving too fast but she really don't know<br/>
Life is a trip lil mama don't drink that<br/>
They telling you it's cool baby don't take that<br/>
Cause if you do ain't no telling<br/>
You's a good girl why you fighting and rebelling<br/>
If you keep that up you gonna end up spread<br/>
Misled better yet sick in the head<br/>
So stop trying to be like them and be yourself<br/>
Stop look and see yourself<br/>
It's so real gotta stay hard in the paint<br/>
You can't fake baby put paint where it ain't<br/>
Monkey see monkey do what I say I do<br/>
If I take one you take two<br/>
<br/>

I love the street life<br/>
There is no place I can go<br/>
Street life<br/>
It's the only life I know<br/>

Street life<br/>
Cause there's no place I can go<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I'm up all night like I'm on twilight<br/>
Turn left turn right your life my life<br/>
Do wrong do right low life high life<br/>
I go green so why you keep offering me white<br/>
Can't stop gotta go hard in the paint<br/>
Can't fake nigga put paint where it ain't<br/>
Monkey see monkey do what I say I do<br/>
If I take one you take two<br/>
