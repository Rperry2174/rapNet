<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy<br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Huh, it's like that that there<br/>
They love it when I let down my hair<br/>
from Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson<br/>
even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel<br/>
So I let 'em all come to my back table<br/>
Roll up and lick the paper if they able<br/>
Bottles of everything, models and everything<br/>
Everything goes and yes I mean everything<br/>
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'<br/>
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'<br/>
So, I invite her over to my party<br/>
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie<br/>
No autographs, I ain't signin' now<br/>
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down<br/>
My life is like one big highlight<br/>
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy<br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion<br/>
With some whites, some asians and persians<br/>
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'<br/>
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains<br/>
She say she wanna be an actress<br/>
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled ACTION!<br/>
Take one, take two, now cut<br/>
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck<br/>
Huh, yeah, here we go again<br/>
I gotta go behind the club just to get in<br/>
They say I'm just too much commotion<br/>
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open<br/>
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub<br/>
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, "One Love"<br/>
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass<br/>
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy<br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room<br/>
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues<br/>
I just stepped in for a quick cameo<br/>
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio<br/>
He keep a bad hoe, I keep a bad hoe<br/>
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go<br/>
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight<br/>
Yes, these Hollywood nights<br/>
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out<br/>
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out<br/>
Cameras flashin', police passin'<br/>
Every little model wanna give me some action<br/>
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it<br/>
Get some m_nage, durin' every visit<br/>
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me<br/>
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy<br/>
Those Hollywood nights<br/>
They drive me crazy
