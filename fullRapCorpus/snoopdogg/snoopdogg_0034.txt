<i>[Fiend]</i><br/>
I run with convicted felons<br/>
Scream, yellin'<br/>
Bitch I'ma soldier!<br/>
Stick in my chrome reciever, and I fins to get it on<br/>
Influenced by the dolja<br/>
Blastin' at the rollers<br/>
Callin' couple of soldiers<br/>
Fuckin' up with this song bitch<br/>
Your mom shoulda told ya<br/>
I ain't nothin' nice<br/>
Snoop brought the boss<br/>
I got the spark, lets go on a body high<br/>
Put it on my life, and my favorite weed pipe<br/>
Soldiers greed, with ice<br/>
Watch me budda up in the night<br/>
Carefull to forever, the one that ?? shot him<br/>
Bringin' the drama like a punk, but your fucking somebody<br/>
Whut Lodi Dodi, send a duce up in dey coupe<br/>
But after a hard eight<br/>
Snoop and his soldiers gonna make ya say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker<br/>
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay (Jeah, nigga, I can make ya say)<br/>

<i>[Mystikal]</i><br/>
Nigga, all I really wanna do is<br/>
Get down, on the get down!<br/>
That mothafucker better sit down<br/>
We up in this bitch now<br/>
Got the take to make the hap<br/>
We gon' make our money right<br/>
Tired of livin' the stress life<br/>
Pressure, fuck price<br/>
Yikes!<br/>
Know what I like<br/>
Keep it hype!<br/>
Betcha I right<br/>
Put pounds of ice on ya, like white on rice<br/>
Vise grips on mics<br/>
Turnin' to fights<br/>
Burnin' up the limelight<br/>
Fire!<br/>
And you ain't gotta strain your eyes to find us<br/>
Throwin' bad days behind us<br/>
Ahh damn up in the headlights<br/>
Bout to let it shine<br/>
Find your ass in there tip-toeing<br/>
Your ass is mine<br/>
We got you waitin' for us on the radio<br/>
So our albums can drop<br/>
Snoop, Fiend, me, Beats By The Pound, you know that's gon' pop<br/>
Jump in the game in the walkway<br/>
With enough money to fuck with<br/>
Till ya hear that last fuckin' woof<br/>
We ain't done yet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Let me here ya say<br/>
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker<br/>

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay<br/>

<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
I come faster than a speedin' bullet<br/>
Or I can take my time and move it slow<br/>
Wake up outta my seat and hit this mic and blow like some indo<br/>
You can call me what you want<br/>
Just don't call me no punk<br/>
My name is Snoop D-O-double-G<br/>
And I'm the godfather of G-Funk<br/>
I'll put this shit down, like clown, Dogg Pound is my set<br/>
Nigga set outta line, I shoot them in they mothafuckin' spine<br/>
And break they necks (nigga, nigga)<br/>
As I go down, you gon' realize that<br/>
See when you run up in my face you able to get smacked, jacked, just<br/>
like that<br/>
I'ma fool, break the rules, damn, way too cool<br/>
They call me Snoop D-O-double-G (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'ma fuckin' fool, I can get silly<br/>
But I'd rather sit back, relax, new jacks, get smacked, cause I'm tryin'<br/>
to<br/>
blaze up a sack (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)<br/>
To my nigga Mystikal, Fiend, and my big homie Master P<br/>
Cause thats just the way this shit gon' be<br/>
Baby, N-O-L-I-M-I-T (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)<br/>
We gon' make y'all say Woof<br/>
Until you mothafuckers demand<br/>
That nigga named Snoop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I can make 'em say<br/>
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker<br/>
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay (laughing)<br/>
I can make 'em say<br/>
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker<br/>
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay<br/>
Let me here ya say<br/>
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker<br/>
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay<br/>
Let me hear ya say<br/>
Woof! mothafucker, Woof! mothafucker<br/>
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yay (everybody in the house)<br/>
