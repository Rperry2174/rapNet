Another smoke session up in this motherfucker<br/>
Blaze some shit up for me Q<br/>
Yea, wussup Dogg, this is whut I'm talkin bout<br/>
Some of that gangsta shit (Eastside)<br/>
Shuttin these niggas up (Shut em up shut em up dogg)<br/>
Westcoast nigga, Quik and Snoop Dogg (Forever)<br/>
9-9 nigga<br/>
<br/>
When I wake up in the morning and I get up out my bed<br/>
I feel good, o yes I do<br/>
Cause I still can give it up for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause we're all a little strong<br/>
In the Beach, where the paper's long<br/>
But as for me<br/>
I only G when I'm buss'n rocks<br/>
Dogg Pound<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
Nigga, you know you gotta have heart<br/>
I told you niggas from the start<br/>
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life<br/>
Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight<br/>
Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?<br/>
I was a motha fuckin' fool<br/>
I had to have papers it was routine<br/>
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens<br/>
I, shake niggas<br/>
Break Niggas<br/>
Make niggas, shank theyselves<br/>
For fuckin with my wealth (nigga)<br/>
And it'll catch on<br/>
Cause if it don't, it's on<br/>
And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone<br/>
Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone<br/>
Clown me ya gone<br/>
Surround me, it's on<br/>
Get the money you're gone<br/>
My niggas' paper so long<br/>
They call him Snoop Capone<br/>
So if you want me, get me, got me<br/>
Should have shot him<br/>
But now they call me Snoop Gotti<br/>
And that's all I LBC<br/>
Betta yet, that's all I DPGC<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
I'm slappin' bones<br/>
In front of my home<br/>
Choppin' game on the phone<br/>
Smokin' a zone<br/>
Big 6, big 5-3's with ya bitches<br/>
My girls in the kitchen, cookin' up some fish and<br/>
I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'<br/>
O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'<br/>
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck<br/>
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet<br/>
Dead, gone, light's out<br/>
With no remorse, I had to take him out<br/>
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny<br/>
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money<br/>
And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)<br/>
And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka)<br/>
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7<br/>
Cause still, all doggs go to heaven<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I'm freestylin'<br/>
C-stylin'<br/>
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island<br/>
Where the bitches and the bud come free<br/>
And everybody listen to the D-O double G<br/>
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts<br/>
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts<br/>
That makes sense, it make big money<br/>
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny<br/>
But I got yo honey, up under my wing<br/>
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing<br/>
I'll put her in a cling<br/>
I won't buy her a ring<br/>
But I'll put her on the hoe-stroll to make me some green<br/>
And even if she never even saw me befo'<br/>
There's just no way that she can tell me no<br/>
You know my game's unbelievable baby (uh uh, uh uh)<br/>
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
West coast, gangsta shit<br/>
My nigga DJ Q<br/>
Yea<br/>
Like I told y'all<br/>
DPG for the 9-9<br/>
DPG, yea Top Dogg, fo sho'<br/>
Smoke y'all
