Coming at you live, it’s your boy big Snoop Dogg<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pronto, you know it how we ball<br/>
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall.<br/>
S.O.D boys, got our money sittin’ tall<br/>
While your money sittin’ small.<br/>
Let me make a phone ciz-allll! ciz-alllll<br/>
I’m callin up my boyz, they’re gonna bring the noise<br/>
When we hit the dance floor.<br/>
My team hardcore, all the girls do adore<br/>
Bouta do the gang rock til my feet get sizzz-ore<br/>
Sizzz-ore<br/>
<br/>
Step on the scene, make the haters say dammit.<br/>
Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em hottest rapper on the planet.<br/>
Ya’ girl love me and I know you can’t stand it.<br/>
Goth-em city doors got ya boy Batmanin’.<br/>
Ya’ girl go hard like Dikembe Mutombo.<br/>
Soulja number one but I ain’t talkin bout the combo.<br/>

Walk inside the club, I need V.I.P<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pronto, Pronto, you know it how we ball<br/>

Go to work, do the jerk, do it till your head hurt<br/>

Superman and Kryptonite all on the same mike<br/>
Send us some bad bitches like<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pronto, Pronto, you know it how we ball<br/>

Mike check 0 1 2 3, I don’t freestyle cuz my style ain’t free!<br/>
Lyrical criminal most have battled for national, Soulja no limit but I'm not talking bout Master P<br/>
I’m in my tour bus a lot and groupies in back of me<br/>
Every boy’ll shoot interview, video, shoot a magazine<br/>
My flow is so sick, the number one off of iTunes<br/>
My flow, quick, can lay you quicker than the fuckin’ swine flu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pronto, Pronto, you know it how we ball<br/>
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall.<br/>

All black let it up, nigga we can get it up<br/>

and I’ll do it till you get enough, and i beat you dead and red and stuff<br/>
what it do, what it is, I see you haven’t read enough<br/>
this is the life I chose for me and this is the way I chose to be<br/>
A lot of fools is holding me but that’s just the way it’s supposed to be<br/>
Never win, against the grain, always playing 20 games<br/>
Stand for something dawg or you gonna fall for anything but later for that<br/>
Yeah, I got my swag back, I’m with the Soulja Boy, that nigga bad, back<br/>
But them GCs and TCs begin the VIP, blowin on some liquor, purple trees<br/>
Jerkin knees, workin these cute bad bitches<br/>
I think they bent their knees, we gonna get them for their cheese<br/>
Break it down, spread it round, five pound<br/>
Put it in the air, right now like pronto<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pronto, Pronto, you know it how we ball<br/>
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall.<br/>
S.O.D boys, got our money sittin’ tall<br/>
While your money sittin’ small.<br/>

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are now approaching 35,000 feet<br/>
Hope you’re enjoying your ride through Wonderland<br/>
I am your flight attendant Boss Lady<br/>
Turn your bottles upside down and your blunts in an upright position<br/>
And please remain seated until the flight has come to a complete stop<br/>
Thanks for flying the friendly skies with your friendly captain Snoop D-O-double-G aka The Homey”
