Watch your mouth never speak on what you not know<br/>
I'm from the west coast I turn his face into a pothole<br/>
15 deep niggas creepin' in the Tahoe<br/>
Let's see you act macho when I pull the burner on ya<br/>
Sideways like a taco<br/>
Rap niggas we all talk like a Raldo<br/>
Trunk full of cargo<br/>
Dry like Barstow<br/>
Arsenal run up on 'em<br/>
Get up on 'em<br/>
Drill 'em with the clips<br/>
Niggas gon' respect mine<br/>
I run this whole shit<br/>
Crip rag in my pocket<br/>
Three eighty on my hip<br/>
But back to this hip hop<br/>
Who next on the list<br/>
Gangstas don't kiss we get old and die rich<br/>
I smoke till I'm sleep<br/>
Crush these niggas with my fist<br/>
Your daddy was a coward you's a son of a bitch<br/>
So back to the glock with the infra-blue clip<br/>
We hit licks and gang bang<br/>
You on some T-Pain shit<br/>
Chop the pop and 20 crip<br/>
Watch the flames hit his whip<br/>
Then I'm back to the block shit<br/>
Rock shit, hot shit<br/>
Hit 'em in the chest<br/>
Doggy run up in his pockets<br/>
Misrepresenting sock him in his eye socket<br/>
I sat back and let you little niggas make your profits<br/>
Nonsense, I'm watching, hoes out of pocket<br/>
You heard what they say<br/>
Don't block it till you knock it<br/>
You stole my whole style<br/>
I'm 'bout to take you fools hostage<br/>
Brrrah, bhrrrrah<br/>
From the looks to the hooks<br/>
I'm looking at these new niggas flippin' through my book<br/>
There's only one king<br/>
Is you a pawn or a rook?<br/>
I got hand machine guns and soldiers on foot<br/>
So beef with me it's none<br/>
Nigga done south huh <br/>
I throw a bullet at ya who gon catch it nigga duck<br/>
Then send them goons at ya<br/>
Turn your weapons into dust<br/>
You against me it's like trying to fight a bus<br/>
I'm at the BET Awards sitting in disgust<br/>
It's still a (G Thang) but yet they wanna be us<br/>
They wanna be Daz<br/>
They wanna be Kurupt<br/>
Cash on delivery money up front<br/>
Yeah <br/>
Bubble kush out a purple blunt<br/>
Who's the best nigga circle one<br/>
Snoop Dogg<br/>
I'm large in the streets<br/>
My arms and my feets knee deep in the game<br/>
I'm the best on the beat<br/>
Let you little niggas speak<br/>
And run for a treat<br/>
Motherfuckin' geeks<br/>
All y'all niggas owe me until you rest in peace<br/>
And that's our D.P.G. motherfucka<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Snoop talking]</i><br/>
That's real shit man<br/>
How the fuck y'all gon' keep having these award shows out here on the west coast<br/>
But ain't no mutherfuckas from the west coast winning no awards, nigga? <br/>
It's like that, it's just like that<br/>
<br/>
We showed you niggas how to do this shit<br/>
Bitch ass nigga.<br/>
Want some, get some.<br/>
Bad enough, take some
