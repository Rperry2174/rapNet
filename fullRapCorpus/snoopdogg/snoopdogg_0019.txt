<i>[Intro: (Snoop talking with homey)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Homey:]</i> Ai Dogg, let me holla at'cha man<br/>
<i>[Snoop:]</i> Wuz up home?<br/>
<i>[Homey:]</i> Word is on the streets<br/>
Your beats gone be delicate since Dre did shake the spea's out,<br/>
man.<br/>
<i>[Snoop:]</i> Delicate? Beats?<br/>
So that's what makes me now?<br/>
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat<br/>
<br/>
(Now let me shake that shit man)<br/>
(I hear ya Dogg)<br/>
(It's a cold, cold thing!)<br/>
(It's a cold thing!)<br/>
(For real, hmm!)<br/>
<br/>
I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes<br/>
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes<br/>
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money<br/>
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny<br/>
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go<br/>
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro<br/>
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it<br/>
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic<br/>
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know<br/>
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go<br/>
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first<br/>
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'ma tell you, man, that's the worst<br/>
Fifth in the world, but I'ma keep my thang together<br/>
Cos I'ma keep makin money and hope everything is still together<br/>
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?<br/>
All y'all broke on the corner, drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm<br/>
doin<br/>
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate<br/>
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state<br/>
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent<br/>
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents<br/>
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin<br/>
Makin more moves than the average Cuban<br/>
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits<br/>
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch<br/>
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'<br/>
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce<br/>
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend<br/>
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in<br/>
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back<br/>
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac<br/>
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight<br/>
Cos I'ma do mines and I'ma keep everything tight<br/>
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught<br/>
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support<br/>
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight<br/>
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life<br/>
Shit, I love my baby boy and all<br/>
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg<br/>
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight<br/>
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right<br/>
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player<br/>
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man<br/>
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you<br/>
And I can put that on everything including you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: (Snoop talking)]</i><br/>
<br/>
One of every five black males berfore the year 2000 will be detained or<br/>
deceased<br/>
No justice, no peace<br/>
Yeah the truth hurts, we scared to go to church<br/>
<br/>
Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points<br/>
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint<br/>
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics<br/>
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin<br/>
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches<br/>
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches<br/>
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders<br/>
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?<br/>
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal<br/>
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real<br/>
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound<br/>
Give it to ya ta put it down and we'll be round to your town<br/>
So just sit in your seats and wait til we come through<br/>
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue<br/>
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do<br/>
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do<br/>
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions<br/>
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep<br/>
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG<br/>
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP<br/>
Now, what we look like?<br/>
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right<br/>
I should get upset but I'ma stay composed<br/>
Chill for a second, spit at some hos<br/>
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank<br/>
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank<br/>
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'ma keep it<br/>
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: (Snoop talking)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we're in drought season<br/>
Niggas lookin for a reason<br/>
It's like thanksgiving without the feast<br/>
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church<br/>
<br/>
They got me runnin from my life, I'm jumpin gates<br/>
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg<br/>
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit<br/>
The dog run up on me I give him a cold<br/>
Like nigga back up off me<br/>
He turn around and bite the police, hmm<br/>
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes<br/>
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho<br/>
They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"<br/>
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jack
