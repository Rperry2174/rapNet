<br/>
<i>[chorus: kokane]</i><br/>
I got bitches all in my game that don't even know my name<br/>

You could talk all day behind my back, but wont say shit in my face<br/>
then pump your brakes, you hoes<br/>
Bitch!<br/>

<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Carla, Darla, Charlene and Camina<br/>
Tereka and Erika, they love to take care of her<br/>
Real motherfucker from the DPG<br/>
Keesha, Resha, Tammy and Renesha<br/>
I appreciate the way y'all skate<br/>
when the clock hit eight<br/>
now April and Kate<br/>
Y'all be doin' too much<br/>
Running your mouths<br/>
Fucking shit up, you gotta get up<br/>
cause I done had enough<br/>
Getting sick and tired of the same stuff<br/>
You told Kamil and she told Karla<br/>
and she told April and now they all know<br/>
But I could give a fuck 'cause all y'all my hoes<br/>
So, all that confronting the real nigga on site<br/>
today is today, last night was last night<br/>
As I leaned with my hand on my balls<br/>
I had to really check these bitches and tell then like this dog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Nina do this and Tina do that<br/>
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats<br/>
Back in the days when I was on the ??<br/>
At an early age man<br/>
I was on the ??<br/>
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get going<br/>
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)<br/>
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out<br/>
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-moma's house<br/>
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am<br/>
You better read your motherfuckin' first telegram<br/>
you remind me of this bitch that used to work for me<br/>
Had to cut the bitch up 'cause she tried to get too close to me<br/>
And tried to confront me at a club one night<br/>
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)<br/>
But you know I had to stop and applause<br/>
And I put my hand on my balls and said ?? what's up dog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
I got my own spot and I got my own keys<br/>
So can't no bitch talk shit to me<br/>
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks<br/>
And kicked me up outta spot<br/>
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'<br/>
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home<br/>
She said she needed a companion<br/>
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home<br/>
Snap, crack, it's on<br/>
But in no time at all seems she fell in love<br/>
But i wasn't ready for that<br/>
Topcat had to scat<br/>
I hit her friend from the back<br/>
While she was at work workin'<br/>
I was jerkin' that skirt<br/>
And fucking with all her friends that was flirtin'<br/>
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)<br/>
A week later she fell in love with my homeboy Kurt<br/>
Bitch you ain't shit but dirt for dirt (bitch!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
This is a sexy bitch<br/>
<br/>
