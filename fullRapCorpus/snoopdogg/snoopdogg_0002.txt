<i>[Intro: Dre]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[man pissing]</i><br/>
Heah hah hah!  <br/>
I'm serious nigga one of y'all niggaz got this ass motherfuckin up<br/>
Aiy baby, aiy baby... aiy baby get some bubblegum in this motherfucker<br/>
Steady long, steady long nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Snoop]</i><br/>
<br/>
With so much drama in the L-B-C<br/>
It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G<br/>
But I, somehow, some way<br/>
Keep comin up with funky ass shit like every single day<br/>
May I, kick a little something for the G's (yeah)<br/>
and, make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze, through<br/>
Two in the mornin and the party's still jumpin<br/>
cause my momma ain't home<br/>
I got bitches in the living room gettin it on<br/>
and, they ain't leavin til six in the mornin (six in the mornin)<br/>
So what you wanna do, sheeeit<br/>
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too<br/>
So turn off the lights and close the doors<br/>
But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yeah!<br/>
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this<br/>
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice<br/>
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin<br/>
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in<br/>
Now this types of shit, happens all the time<br/>
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine<br/>
Everything is fine when you listenin to the D-O-G<br/>
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he<br/>
who listens, to the words that I speak<br/>
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street<br/>
and get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)<br/>
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)<br/>
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please<br/>
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these<br/>
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze<br/>
beeeitch, I'm just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Later on that day<br/>
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray<br/>
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke<br/>
Shit, this ain't no joke<br/>
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down<br/>
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now<br/>
But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin<br/>
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton<br/>
To serve me, not with a cherry on top<br/>
Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot<br/>
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes<br/>
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'<br/>
And I'll be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice (beeotch!!)<br/>
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)<br/>
Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice (beeotch!!)<br/>
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
