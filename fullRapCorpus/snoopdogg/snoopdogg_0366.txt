<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?<br/>
In the lane, snow is glistening<br/>
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight<br/>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anna Kendrick:]</i><br/>
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus<br/>
Right down Santa Claus Lane<br/>
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer<br/>
Pulling on the reins<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Gone away is the bluebird<br/>
Here to stay is a new bird<br/>
He sings a love song<br/>
While we stroll along<br/>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br/>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br/>
Will pretend that he is Parson Brown<br/>
He'll say: Are you married?<br/>
We'll say: No man<br/>
But you can do the job<br/>
When you're in town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg (Anna Kendrick):]</i><br/>
Later on, we'll conspire<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
As we dream by the fire<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
To face unafraid<br/>
The plans that we've made<br/>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br/>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br/>
(Bells are ringing, children singing)<br/>
Will pretend that he is Parson Brown<br/>
(All is merry and bright)<br/>
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman<br/>
(Hang your stockings and say your prayers)<br/>
Until the other kiddies knock him down<br/>
(Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg (Anna Kendrick) x2:]</i><br/>
When it snows, ain't it thrilling<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
Though your nose gets a chilling<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br/>
(Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Once upon a time in the LBC<br/>
Santa came up missing, he was sitting by a tree<br/>
His reindeers were near but their leader wouldn't lead<br/>
So I took the lead, now as we proceed<br/>
This ain't for no mistletoe, but you need to listen, yo<br/>
Just in case you didn't know, I call this my Christmas flow<br/>
I can take you higher, higher, chestnuts roast on an open fire<br/>
Gone away, think that's what the, what the song say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg (Anna Kendrick):]</i><br/>
Gone away is the bluebird<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
Here to stay is a new bird<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
He sings a love song<br/>
While we stroll along<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br/>
(Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)<br/>
A beautiful sight, what we have tonight<br/>
(Here comes Santa Claus)<br/>
Walking in a winter wonderland<br/>
(Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)<br/>
Ho, ho, ho
