<i>[Hook - Big Bub:]</i><br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I'm represented by Fetti, I'm so hardcore<br/>
Feet to the floor, up on a cord<br/>
Kick open the door, not knowing the score<br/>
I'm tatted and matted, added, that's 4 to the 4<br/>
Now we say, well is he good or he great?<br/>
Don't even wait, just clean the food off your plate<br/>
Say your grace, for the life that you make<br/>
Now he butted and skutting, cutting the knife in the steak<br/>
Wow, I'm and out of TI, all about it<br/>
Cause I handle my BI, CI, I see you<br/>
Wanna get a flair, no faking<br/>
Let's take it cause I love this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Big Bub:]</i><br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Now when I'm on your, my spirit's unpure<br/>
And there's no cure for sure but I adore<br/>
I walk around the town and I explore<br/>
I'm greeted by 100 fans at my front door<br/>
Encore is what they want, much more<br/>
I'm smooth like suede with a touch of valore<br/>
On the rocks, Ciroc, glass and I pour<br/>
Snoop Dogg is the shit, get your ass on the floor<br/>
You can choose best and 2 step to this<br/>
Smoked up cause my weed is the shit<br/>
Take down and break down the verse<br/>
Put the S in your chest when worst comes to worst<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Big Bub:]</i><br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
This why they show me mad love around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Yeah all around the world<br/>
Big Bub, Snoop Dogg<br/>
Real love<br/>
From the streets to the suites<br/>
Everywhere I go<br/>
Everywhere I been<br/>
Love, love<br/>
Go head, go head, go head<br/>
Say that, say that, say that<br/>
Oh yeah they do<br/>
Another classic<br/>
That's real love right there man<br/>
All around the world<br/>
Shout out to the whole globe<br/>
Love y'all, nasty piece
