<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
And now, our national anthem!<br/>
It's going down, West Coast<br/>
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!<br/>
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection<br/>
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo<br/>
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest<br/>
Here's a toast to the coast!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack 10:]</i><br/>
What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress<br/>
Well known riders from different sides of the West<br/>
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up<br/>
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?<br/>
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs<br/>
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s<br/>
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping<br/>
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?<br/>
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could<br/>
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood<br/>
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise<br/>
Two well known enemies now becoming allies<br/>
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way<br/>
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)<br/>
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang<br/>
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg x2:]</i><br/>
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people<br/>
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)<br/>
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people<br/>
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)<br/>
Party people, party people; do you wanna get funky?<br/>
Get down.. get down.. you know..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bad Azz:]</i><br/>
Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it<br/>
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it<br/>
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy<br/>
We're all heated just in case; any of my enemies slipped in<br/>
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon<br/>
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom<br/>
The ladies love me cause I love myself<br/>
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find;<br/>
I'm at the top of the shelf<br/>
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip<br/>
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers<br/>
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers<br/>
Fantastic, brand new in this classic<br/>
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked<br/>
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right<br/>
West Coast, East Side, for life!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Techniec:]</i><br/>
It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you<br/>
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew<br/>
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew<br/>
My life cycle completes the last stages<br/>
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous<br/>
Cause I was born to rock the party<br/>
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!<br/>
I'm cold hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing<br/>
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling<br/>
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East<br/>
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease<br/>
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case<br/>
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste<br/>
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech<br/>
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
That's real, you know<br/>
It's getting kind funky here man, uhh..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique<br/>
I can't get enough of this gangster shit<br/>
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+<br/>
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs<br/>
See the opponents; disassemble the components<br/>
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment<br/>
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime<br/>
With a criminal mind, the raw kind<br/>
Microphones used so abusively<br/>
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T<br/>
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho<br/>
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister<br/>
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted<br/>
To be specific; niggas ain't being realistic<br/>
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test<br/>
In the west; where it's about your money and your set<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Threat:]</i><br/>
You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow<br/>
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow<br/>
Dream, on out far, pass the stars<br/>
Your styles ain't doper than ours<br/>
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more<br/>
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors<br/>
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage<br/>
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades<br/>
Me, C to the Z to the T<br/>
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets<br/>
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane<br/>
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it<br/>
It's like magic, it's so tragic<br/>
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo<br/>
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s<br/>
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs<br/>
Keep it real though!
