A yes sir, radio station, BUSH69 when you're down<br/>
Take me to the streets, shout out to the people out there in the city living that life<br/>
We 'bout to get off into that brand new Snoop Dogg produced by Pharrell<br/>
So everybody in the city tonight, I want to you roll your window down and turn the music up loud, enjoy<br/>
Radio station BUSH69, holdin it down<br/>
<br/>
Grab your money, we're getting out this neighbourhood<br/>
Milk and honey, we're gonna burn up Hollywood, ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
Beach of Fortune and the neon sky<br/>
You know while back with us will be go tonight<br/>
That's what they told us and they must be right, so let's ride<br/>
They built this city for you and me yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Snooooooop<br/>
They built this city for you and me yeah<br/>
Snooooooop<br/>
They built this city for you and me yeah<br/>
Snooooooop<br/>
They built this city for you and me yeah<br/>
Snooooooop<br/>
<br/>
Champagne wishes, taste like American pie<br/>
Rags to riches, you never know unless you try<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
All day wanna play, wanna rock with her<br/>
All day, every day on the block with her<br/>
My city, oh really be popping huh?<br/>
64s, hip hop and locking up<br/>
We changed the lane, remained the bain<br/>
Little bit of joy with a lot of pain<br/>
Is he Snoop Lion or Doggy mayne?<br/>
Ask me again, I tell you the same<br/>
DO Dubb with the key to the city<br/>
Me and Pete, we go DYD<br/>
Rip down, put my foot down<br/>
And if I'm in your town then I got to get down<br/>
Fight nights in Vegas<br/>
Bright lights we made it<br/>
Slayed it, slightly faded<br/>
Californicated and highly motivated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
