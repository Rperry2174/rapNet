<i>[Hook: Pharell]</i><br/>
Spin around ma<br/>
Drop, drop, like it's hot<br/>
Drop, drop, like it's hot<br/>
Spending money mang<br/>
Drop, drop, like it's hot<br/>
Drop, drop, like it's hot<br/>
Spin around mommy<br/>
Drop, drop, like it's hot<br/>
Drop, drop, like it's hot<br/>
I got the rollie on my arm<br/>
And I'm pouring Chandon<br/>
And I roll the best weed<br/>
'Cause I got it going on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: 1 - Pharrell]</i><br/>
No steroids can make you hit what I'm pitching<br/>
Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen<br/>
You niggas is scratching, my niggas is itchen<br/>
Don't keep "Pacin" but these dudes blow they "Pistons"<br/>
Yes, nigga, P stands for polish<br/>
None of y'all is fucking with he, and this is obvious<br/>
I'm Ron Artest, laying down to your garbage<br/>
While my niggas in the street pushing shit like Ben Wallace<br/>
And any ya'll could get it, even fans in the stands<br/>
These guns is a sun, you'll catch a tan with ya man<br/>
I'm no cheeto, trust this is real/rio<br/>
Everything is grande nothing is poquito<br/>
Security's behind me, with the torpedo<br/>
'Cause the wrist stay frigid<br/>
How you say it? Frio<br/>
Or where I'm from, in Virgina, we say ch-ill<br/>
And the ends also quarter million for each whe-el<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got hatas on my j-iz-ock, plus the frickin c-iz-ops<br/>
All of whom want to hit me with sh-iz-ots til I dr-iz-op<br/>
Thank God for hip hop, or I be in the b-iz-ox, uh<br/>
Jail or casket, either way you r-iz-ot<br/>
But now I'm so fresh you could smell me through a ziplock<br/>
Mr. S d-iz-ot, it's not gon' st-iz-op<br/>
Too much pizzas for these piss-ass niggas to get past<br/>
Too cool for c-iz-ops to cuff his iz-ass<br/>
Snitch-ass they made, they can't get the boy<br/>
These niggas givin' out cases like a liquore store<br/>
Runnin' to the DA tryin' to get me for it<br/>
All the money it made, I'm like forget the law<br/>
I'm not 'fr-iz-aid, it J-iz-ay homie you got pl-iz-ayed<br/>
Take it like a man, the flow ran you off the st-iz-age (go sit down)<br/>
Wastin' ya time tryin' to sue S. tell ya lawyer<br/>
"Take that civil case and drop it like it's hot"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
(World Wide)<br/>
International, nah I'm universal<br/>
But you a gangsta, how you get to do commertials?<br/>
With them big wheels, yeah cause you do it big<br/>
I stay real, stay sharp, and tell it like it is<br/>
I never fake the funk, niggas know I ain't no punk<br/>
They want beef? Yeah cause, pop the trunk<br/>
We go all the way, we do it lifesize<br/>
Now my life right, 'cause my wife on my right side<br/>
Yeah, and she protecting my interest<br/>
Now I'm on the move they got me hoppin' these fences<br/>
Ay little homie your defence is defenceless<br/>
A pimp apprentice<br/>
Now come here princess (Come here, come here)<br/>
I know ya tired of the chit-chatter<br/>
It really don't matta it's like a seesaw platter<br/>
I check money, check niggas, check bitches<br/>
Now drop it like you ass on swit-ches (Ziip)<br/>
<br/>
