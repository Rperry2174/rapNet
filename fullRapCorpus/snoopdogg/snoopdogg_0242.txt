Gotta get away<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
‘Cause when them boys in my shooting<br/>
They I’m missing on a dark play<br/>
‘Cause when you at them and tell them<br/>
And the gun fill them belly<br/>
And grown enough so you can be the last living crew for<br/>
The euphoria, the euphoria<br/>
Shoot <i>[x20]</i><br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
You gonna have to jump on it<br/>
You gonna have to lift it<br/>
You gonna have to jump on it<br/>
You gonna have to lift it<br/>
You gonna have to jump on it<br/>
You gonna have to lift it<br/>
You gonna have to jump on it<br/>
You gonna have to lift it<br/>
‘Cause when you at them and tell them<br/>
And the gun fill them belly<br/>
And grown enough so you can be the last living crew for<br/>
The euphoria , the euphoria<br/>
Shoot <i>[x20]</i><br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
Gotta get away<br/>
To a place I love<br/>
To a place I love
