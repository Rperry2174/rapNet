<i>[Willie Nelson]</i><br/>
You know Snoopy a little while back<br/>
I had one of those, carpal tunnel operations<br/>
And the doctor said "I want you to go home and <br/>
SHUT UP (mm) for four months," annnd that's kinda tough<br/>
I said "I'll try it," but while I was there<br/>
I wrote this song <i>[strums his guitar]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Willie Nelson]</i><br/>
Too many pain pills, too much pot<br/>
Tryin to be somethin that I'm not - Superman! Superman<br/>
Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand<br/>
I ain't Superman - know what I'm talkin 'bout?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I blew my throat and I blew my tour<br/>
I wound up sippin on soup d'jour - I wasn't Superman<br/>
Oh no, I wasn't Superman<br/>
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand<br/>
I wasn't Superman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Willie Nelson]</i><br/>
I hear ya! Mickey play with us<br/>
... <i>[harmonica solo]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah, play that Mickey, go ahead!<br/>
Play it Willie! <i>[more harmonica]</i><br/>
Yeah... go ahead Willie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Willie Nelson]</i><br/>
Well the doctor said son it's a cryin shame<br/>
But you ain't Clark Kent and I ain't Lois Lane<br/>
You ain't Superman; you ain't Superman<br/>
Tryin to do more than you can, you got a little outta hand<br/>
You ain't Superman - whaddya think Snoop?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Well when I die, put it on my stone<br/>
God said Snoop you take your bad ass home you wasn't Superman<br/>
Ha ha ha, no, I wasn't Superman<br/>
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand<br/>
I wasn't Superman (I hear ya!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Both]</i><br/>
Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand<br/>
I ain't Superman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Yeahhh!
