<i>[Intro - Don Magic Juan (echo)]</i><br/>
Boss Playa .. Boss Playa ..<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg .. is a Boss Playa<br/>
This is the archbishop .. Don Magic Juan<br/>
Skin and game, cheah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (pimp game)<br/>
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (pimp game)<br/>
And to me you know it aint no motherfuckin' thang<br/>
To give it to you plain and simple, cause you know its played<br/>
Holla at 'em Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang (go ahead)<br/>
Ok son, I'll tell ya like my nigga "Pootie Tang"<br/>
I got that bounce, to make her booty swang<br/>
That little cutie thang, 'fraid she's a beauty bang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Rollin' with a player cause thats what he was<br/>
And dedicated to his paper, Jesus<br/>
On his bitches (hard as feeds uck)<br/>
And if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up<br/>
He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa<br/>
With a pocket full of big faced Visas<br/>
They say its cheaper to keep her, now baby ease up<br/>
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up<br/>
Now sit your ass in the treesa<br/>
And do me a favor and turn the music up<br/>
Should I slap her, or should I freak her<br/>
I'll take the stronga, you can have the weaka<br/>
Speak when spoken to, yeah I broke a few<br/>
And by the way I was hoping you<br/>
Had a freak for me and a freak for you<br/>
I make 'em do for us<br/>
The thang you been wantin' her to do for months<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Don Magic Juan - talking]</i><br/>
This is the Chairman of the Board ..<br/>
The archbishop Don Magic Juan ..<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg .. is a boss playa<br/>
As a matter a fact<br/>
I was there when he was crowned 'Boss Playa', cheah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I had three on my right arm and four on my left<br/>
Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death<br/>
Had to catch my breath, watch my step<br/>
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref<br/>
And call a timeout, before you put your dime out<br/>
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out<br/>
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"<br/>
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart<br/>
A brand new start<br/>
Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part<br/>
And that was smart<br/>
It's like a art the way I articulate<br/>
And break these bitches from state to state<br/>
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate<br/>
I ain't ask for it homie I just shake and bake<br/>
I won't fake to make you buy my tape<br/>
I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith<br/>
Fuck straight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Snoop Dogg (female voice)]</i><br/>
Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)<br/>
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)<br/>
Would you lie to me? (Never)<br/>
Would you die for me? (Whenever)<br/>
<br/>
Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)<br/>
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)<br/>
Would you lie to me? (Never)<br/>
Would you die for me? (Whenever, whenever)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Don Magic Juan - talking]</i><br/>
Big Snoop Dogg, lets you know ..<br/>
That this game ain't for no lame ..<br/>
If you got heart, you can play this game<br/>
But if your heart ain't right<br/>
We got a remedy for that, too<br/>
You gotta go see the wizard .. to get you some heart<br/>
And the archbishop Don Magic Juan is the Wizard<br/>
That's got the game .. for them lame<br/>
Boss Playa .. Boss Playa .. that's what this gang is all about<br/>
Boss Playa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Woman talking]</i><br/>
Gangsta, Gangsta, where you been?<br/>
Round the corner messin' with brothanem<br/>
Youngsta, Youngsta, you at it again?<br/>
Poppin' gats for the fuck of it, when you know you got ends<br/>
I don't think that you should be in the streets like that<br/>
You know you the fashion type of cat<br/>
Always in them stores, with major whores<br/>
Doin' things, bling bling<br/>
West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin' smokin', always chokin' in the green<br/>
With the sticky in yo hand fo sho<br/>
Everybody round ya cause  they know you got mo'<br/>
Wet Cristal, you like to get wild<br/>
You like to dip in yo sexy shit<br/>
Rollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT<br/>
L.B.C. rollin' with me, ohh
