You niggas don't hear me though<br/>
Turn it up, nigga, this shit's in stereo<br/>
I walked in with a philly ho<br/>
Let me give it to you, young locc, on the really though<br/>
Hands, the keys, the Benz, the trees<br/>
The birds, the bees, the C's, the G's<br/>
I get it like I'm 'posed to, you should be close to me<br/>
Right up under my wing<br/>
Words I sing, verbs I bring<br/>
Bread to the park, head in the dark<br/>
Ready with art, I said it with heart<br/>
Merely distorted, dearly departed<br/>
Look what you started<br/>
I'm cool as a mother and you acting retarded<br/>
Just what the motherfuckin' doctor ordered<br/>
It's the d-o-g with the p-o-p<br/>
Not one, not two, but three<br/>
<br/>
I gotta have two or more<br/>
Two or more, baby<br/>
Maybe even three or four<br/>
Like three, like four<br/>
Listen to me, baby<br/>
I need two or more<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Maybe even three or four<br/>
She likes love, drugs, and sex<br/>
Love, drugs, and sex<br/>
She likes love, drugs, and sex<br/>
<br/>
Have a seat and don't say one word<br/>
Cause you will never catch Snoop Dogg with just one bird<br/>
And if I do, I'll probably kick it to the curb<br/>
And come anew<br/>
Runnin' back, I'm-a keep runnin' through<br/>
Hut one, hut two<br/>
Down set, hike two, three, four<br/>
We go overtime<br/>
I'm-a give you something that's gonna blow your mind<br/>
And take your time, relax a bit<br/>
I came here to mack a bitch<br/>
This P is so immaculate<br/>
I rap a bit just to taste<br/>
Puttin' hair to the snare to the bass<br/>
Snap that, Snapchat, flick it up<br/>
One of me, three of ya'll, so lick it up<br/>
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again<br/>
Nigga, could you sing it again?<br/>
<br/>
I gotta have two or more<br/>
Two or more, baby<br/>
Maybe even three or four<br/>
Like three, like four<br/>
Listen to me, baby<br/>
I need two or more<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Maybe even three or four<br/>
She likes love, drugs, and sex<br/>
Love, drugs, and sex<br/>
She likes love, drugs, and sex<br/>
<br/>
Freak-a-leek, I speak the truth<br/>
I got girls lined up trying to get in the booth<br/>
Original, more like a miracle<br/>
High definition visual, digital, minimal<br/>
But it can be maxed out<br/>
Track meet, more meat blow your back out<br/>
I had to pull the 'lac out<br/>
Cause there was too many of ya'll to be left out<br/>
I stepped out mackish with the whole package<br/>
Bread with the cabbage, me and a bad bitch<br/>
Or two, make it three<br/>
31 flavors, nigga<br/>
It gets no better than this<br/>
Now, who in the world can get you more wetter than this?<br/>
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again<br/>
Nigga, could you sing it again?<br/>
<br/>
I gotta have two or more<br/>
Two or more, baby<br/>
Maybe even three or four<br/>
Like three, like four<br/>
Listen to me, baby<br/>
I need two or more<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Maybe even three or four<br/>
She likes love, drugs, and sex<br/>
Love, drugs, and sex<br/>
She likes love, drugs, and sex<br/>
<br/>
Two or more
