That's short Jay<br/>
Gators on your feet<br/>
Six piece outfit<br/>
Hat to the side<br/>
Four bitches on your arm<br/>
<br/>
I keep my glass in my hand <br/>
In case I want to get my drink on<br/>
Feeling way pimping<br/>
Should I put the white mink on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You Got to do it<br/>
Suited N Booted<br/>
Me and my niggas stay <br/>
Suited and Booted<br/>
<br/>
Game is tight<br/>
I'ma put this gold link on<br/>
Feeling way pimpin<br/>
Should I put the blue mink on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
What you think we toasting for<br/>
Me and my nephews west coast for sho<br/>
We keep the best of indigo<br/>
We count our blessings, give thanks and then we blow<br/>
I'll say it again, I know I've said it before<br/>
Why Snoop be letting his mink drag on the floor<br/>
That's pimp shit, something you wouldn't know<br/>
G'd up from the feet up, laying low<br/>
<br/>
Game on lock<br/>
That's why I got this link on<br/>
Feeling way pimpin<br/>
Should I put the green mink on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I keep my glass in my hand <br/>
In case I want to get my drink on<br/>
Snoop Dogg clothing <br/>
With a light pink mink on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Mayre Gators, maylike boots<br/>
Seven piece custom made suits<br/>
Hats to match, counting my chicken stratch<br/>
Just cut a deal with Cadillac<br/>
Fo real, that's why I be dressed to kill<br/>
Sixty-five G's for a Snoop Deville<br/>
Get you one, matter fact get two<br/>
They come in burgundy, but I'ma paint mine blue<br/>
I can't come through half steppin'<br/>
I keep me a cane as a potental weapon<br/>
Slap a bitch or beat a nigga up too<br/>
I do what the fuck I want to do<br/>
I stay cool, act the fool, represented<br/>
Hard from the get go, so hard to the finish<br/>
The cleanest, the meanest, I know that's right<br/>
And don't get to close cause these gators bite<br/>
<br/>
Game is lock<br/>
That's why I got this link on<br/>
Feeling way pimpin<br/>
Should I put the orange mink on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I keep my glass in my hand <br/>
In case I want to get my drink on<br/>
Snoop Dogg clothing <br/>
With a honey brown mink on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Suited N Booted baby<br/>
Lemme add something up for you real quick<br/>
Fifteen-hundred dollar gators<br/>
Six thousand dollar suit<br/>
Twelve-hundred dollar hat<br/>
My muthafuckin glass cost eight-hundred dollars<br/>
And the Snoop Deville I just jumped out of that's sixty-five G's<br/>
Plus the ounce that I got in my pocket<br/>
Add me up nigga, that's a hundred something thousand<br/>
Motherfucker can you buy that<br/>
That's called being suited N booted<br/>
G'd up from the feet up, can you dig it<br/>
And we do this here like seven dizzles a wizzle<br/>
Fa shizzle my nizzle, the big Snoopy D-O-double-jizzle<br/>
Back up in the hizzle, Da Boss, Nigga
