Meech<br/>
Bow Wow<br/>
Yeah <br/>
Dogg House <br/>
Oh serious <br/>
I heard that<br/>
So I didn't know about all that<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Keep my industry as much as possible<br/>
Snoop Dogg<br/>
Found out, found out<br/>
On all ya'll niggas<br/>
Check me out homie<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I go <br/>
I got niggas and bitches on my dick trying to take my shit<br/>
Now, I don't really know <br/>
But I try to keep my head to the skitta<br/>
Slice my piece of hitta<br/>
Whatcha hating for?<br/>
You better get up, get out and get your own, Nigga<br/>
Pick up the phone and holla at your folks<br/>
Young locs in the hood, mashing Dogg House<br/>
Fuck them other fools<br/>
D-O-double G<br/>
Kick back, blaze the sack <br/>
I catch a muthafucking big, Mack Attack<br/>
We blazing up the dogg<br/>
It'll hurt you<br/>
Nothing but purple in my circle<br/>
To the day we die<br/>
We don't get money, bitches and high<br/>
Dogg House Gangsta Crip<br/>
Right back in your muthafucking ass for the R-2-G, bitch<br/>
What ya'll wanna do?<br/>
Seems like niggas wanna talk all night<br/>
What we gonna do?<br/>
We ain't gonna say nothing more, we gonna get with ya'll, on side<br/>
That's how suppose to see<br/>
So all that straggling in the gate trying to get close to me <br/>
Ya'll niggas need to stop<br/>
Trying to flip the hip hop scrip<br/>
I snap and crackling POP<br/>
Tell your friends and folks<br/>
It's a whole new year and situation and I'm still hating hoes<br/>
Will it ever stop?<br/>
Look I really don't know but on the up I doubt that, loc <br/>
Now what about your hood?<br/>
Man, I'm doing mine they're doing there's <br/>
So I guess It's all good<br/>
And, what about your crew?<br/>
Shit, my crew it's +Tha Eastsidaz+<br/>
Fool, I thought u knew<br/>
Dogg Pound ain't the same?<br/>
Yeah, them niggas split up and did they own thang and went made their own gang<br/>
Money is thicker than water?<br/>
That's fuck up but on the real that's how it is cuz, damn<br/>
The world just ain't the same?<br/>
And come to find out this niggas crossing out my muthafucking name <br/>
So what am I to do?<br/>
I put it on mind continue to shine<br/>
Everything fine<br/>
In G-O-D we trust<br/>
That's why ya'll suckers can't "Touch us, Touch us"<br/>
Meech u made the beat<br/>
And you know when we get together <br/>
Shit, we like bread and meat <br/>
We coming with the heat<br/>
Close your mouth cause Dogg House is definitely turning it out<br/>
And what about the cop?<br/>
I pay them and the ones I didn't I slaved them, haha<br/>
Will it ever stop?<br/>
It's like asking "Who is it" before a nigga even knock<br/>
The game is here to stay?<br/>
And I'm here to change the rules cause I'm a player that loves to play<br/>
Did you thank the lord today?<br/>
Think I did and on that note young loc, I'm getting dose<br/>
Why you tell the truth?<br/>
Cause I'm hundred twenty proof from the turf to the roof<br/>
Bigg Snoop
