Don't disrespect me. Do not disrespect.<br/>
I don't disrespect you niggas, I don't bother you niggas. I get my money the way I do. Leave me alone. I don't disrespect you niggas.<br/>
Leave me alone. Don't disrespect me. Please, just leave me alone. I'm getting my money the way I do, I'm in my own comfort zone.<br/>
Leave me alone. Don't disrespect me. Keep to myself, you keep your yourself. Leave me alone!<br/>
<br/>
Radio, TV, and even the press<br/>
They want the meaning of V-A-P-O-R-S<br/>
Now the meaning of this word without no doubt<br/>
Means nobody wants to be down when you're down and out<br/>
Now when you established and got a lot of money<br/>
Everybody wants to be your buddy and honey<br/>
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers<br/>
(Here comes the vapors)<br/>
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya<br/>
For this is the season for catching the vapors<br/>
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do<br/>
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew<br/>
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records<br/>
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it<br/>
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began<br/>
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam<br/>
The type of female with fly Gucci gear<br/>
She had a big herringbone with a weave in her hair<br/>
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess<br/>
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"<br/>
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer<br/>
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her<br/>
But now he sport boots that match with his suits<br/>
Push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cute<br/>
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and<br/>
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend<br/>
To get his beeper number she be begging please<br/>
Dying for the day to eat these<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
<br/>
I got a little cousin that's kinda plain<br/>
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang<br/>
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back<br/>
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that<br/>
I remember when he used to scrap every day<br/>
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey<br/>
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied<br/>
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside<br/>
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad<br/>
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had<br/>
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster<br/>
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him<br/>
But now he's grown up to their surprise<br/>
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide<br/>
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child<br/>
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle<br/>
<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
<br/>
I got another homie from tha L-B-C<br/>
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G<br/>
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse<br/>
...and all that mess<br/>
I remember when we first started to rock<br/>
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop<br/>
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted<br/>
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"<br/>
Now my homie Warren still tried<br/>
On and on and on til the like break of dawn<br/>
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick<br/>
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped<br/>
Now for the year after Regulate<br/>
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight<br/>
He walked into the same record shop as before<br/>
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"<br/>
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it<br/>
Damn it feels good to see people up on it<br/>
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't<br/>
Now guess what they caught since he busting<br/>
The vapors<br/>
<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
<br/>
Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg<br/>
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog<br/>
When I was a teenager I tried to be down<br/>
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound<br/>
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"<br/>
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp<br/>
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set<br/>
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest<br/>
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait<br/>
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight<br/>
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music<br/>
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi<br/>
But now things switched from West to East<br/>
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?<br/>
We used to see Daz back in the day"<br/>
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed<br/>
You caught the vapors<br/>
<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
He caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors
