<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoop Dogg is out<br/>
You wanna be there partyin'<br/>
All night long<br/>
Until the break of dawn<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now stop, pause, chill for a second<br/>
It's Snoop Dogg and Teddy Riley on the record<br/>
Tell your mama, tell your daddy, tell all your friends<br/>
They got a party that's crackin' and that shit won't end<br/>
Me and my folks, we drink and we smoke, we rockin' the boat<br/>
We pop about four, five more, so<br/>
Bend don't break, break don't bend<br/>
I'm number one with a bullet, I'ma make more ends<br/>
When you're great they gonna hate<br/>
So what, that's probably why we Cali-fornicate<br/>
And shake to a whole nother elevation<br/>
Catch me in the hood or your favorite television station<br/>
Creatin', a whole nother lane for the generation<br/>
I drink Sunkist for the good vibration<br/>
Dippin', Rippin', shakin' and bakin'<br/>
I know you've been patiently waitin', I'm back y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoop Dogg is out<br/>
You wanna be there partyin'<br/>
All night long<br/>
Until the break of dawn<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
On your mark, set, party on 3<br/>
4, hit the floor and go for what ya know (hey!)<br/>
I'm in the party low-key, blowin' an eighth of dro<br/>
I'm playful but I don't play<br/>
Spinnin' the globe like the strobe<br/>
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night<br/>
If I plan to go right, a cold night<br/>
in hell before I fail, I'm alright<br/>
Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'<br/>
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair<br/>
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand<br/>
Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man<br/>
Brazil to Iceland<br/>
I shine like a million lights man<br/>
The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it<br/>
I don't need to shout it, you better read about it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoop Dogg is out<br/>
You wanna be there partyin'<br/>
All night long<br/>
Until the break of dawn<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now pose like a superstar, walk like a model<br/>
I love it when you pop that bottle<br/>
I love it 'cause you're not so automatic<br/>
I love it when you put it where Dogg can grab it<br/>
I got my hands where you'll let me<br/>
I love it when you dance, so sexy<br/>
I love it when you in that night mood<br/>
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you<br/>
I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to<br/>
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue<br/>
I let it do what it might do<br/>
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery<br/>
I'm blessed with history<br/>
No less than best, catch the rest<br/>
Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose<br/>
Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoop Dogg is out<br/>
You wanna be there partyin'<br/>
All night long<br/>
Until the break of dawn<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh<br/>
Oooh weee, oooh weee ooh
