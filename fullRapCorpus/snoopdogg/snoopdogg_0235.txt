<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm smoking everywhere I go<br/>
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)<br/>
I always gotta keep one rolled<br/>
(I keep that, need that, got that)<br/>
I'm rolling every gram I own<br/>
(that purp, that bomb, that kush)<br/>
don't gotta understand, they know<br/>
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Concentrated, everyday I'm faded<br/>
tree's prepared and properly cultivated<br/>
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals<br/>
just me and my buddy, ya hear me now<br/>
never treat ya wrong, to each his own<br/>
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong<br/>
we up in smoke, making street schemes<br/>
smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams<br/>
break it down, put it in the zig zag<br/>
and pull the top back and let the ass drag<br/>
hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch<br/>
executive branch, get a whiff of this<br/>
black car, sack a dank<br/>
high school nigga what the fuck you think<br/>
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors<br/>
and everyday I'm high as a muthafucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm smoking everywhere I go<br/>
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)<br/>
I always gotta keep one rolled<br/>
(I keep that, need that, got that)<br/>
I'm rolling every gram I own<br/>
(that purp, that bomb, that kush)<br/>
don't gotta understand, they know<br/>
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling<br/>
my bitches only notice it if its potent<br/>
bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean<br/>
get in between your legs<br/>
join roaches and ashes all in your bed<br/>
you calling her babe, she calling me instead<br/>
cause I put that game all in her hair<br/>
she saw the crib, she know that I'm balling<br/>
when he ain't have nothing he used to stall em<br/>
now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him<br/>
and my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big<br/>
and now when we shop we don't care what the cost is<br/>
rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit<br/>
blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit<br/>
now she all fuck her man, rubberbands in my pocket<br/>
getting money, going hard for my profit<br/>
bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings<br/>
young nigga getting bread, why knock it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm smoking everywhere I go<br/>
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)<br/>
I always gotta keep one rolled<br/>
(I keep that, need that, got that)<br/>
I'm rolling every gram I own<br/>
(that purp, that bomb, that kush)<br/>
don't gotta understand, they know<br/>
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that<br/>
<br/>
In highschool, we do just like we like to<br/>
we cordially invite you<br/>
now roll up get high to it<br/>
we welcome you to highschool<br/>
we do just like we like to<br/>
we cordially invite you<br/>
now roll up get high to it<br/>
get high to it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm smoking everywhere I go<br/>
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)<br/>
I always gotta keep one rolled<br/>
(I keep that, need that, got that)<br/>
I'm rolling every gram I own<br/>
(that purp, that bomb, that kush)<br/>
don't gotta understand, they know<br/>
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that
