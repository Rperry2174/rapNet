Bank accounts big cars<br/>
Living good like a movie star<br/>
My mama house ain't in the hood no more<br/>
I moved her out to San Luis Obispo<br/>
But it's a trip though cause I'm a 20 Crip though<br/>
I gotta lay low my homies wanna do low<br/>
I got two strikes and I'm a get my third<br/>
These niggas snitching on me they think I'm selling birds<br/>
So when I'm in the streets I'm quick on my feet<br/>
See talk is cheap so I stay quick on my heat<br/>
You niggas bad well Dogg is badder<br/>
Rat-a-tatter make you niggas scatter<br/>
I went shotta your boy want me now<br/>
Went to the station that nigga straight point me out<br/>
So I'm a lay away and spray away and spray away<br/>
Cause at this time I think it's best I just stay away<br/>
<br/>
They say I am a fool cause I like to do my thing my own way<br/>
I gotta couple strikes against me one more and I'm on my way<br/>
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do I gotta get my bread<br/>
Keep my head it's either go to jail or get this money instead<br/>
<br/>
Separate elevate<br/>
Concentrate dominate and innovate<br/>
Try to be fly as me<br/>
And every other homie tell them lie to me<br/>
I need a deal I need some stones<br/>
I need some beats Dogg I need a loan<br/>
Help me out throw me some cash<br/>
If I got you got it and you ain't got to ask<br/>
But on the real or is it lately<br/>
A lot of homies they tried to implicate me<br/>
They say I am changed is it the fame<br/>
If I throw it to you then charge it to the game<br/>
Money fold overload<br/>
In the hood another episode<br/>
Man I'm getting old the game cold<br/>
Yeah I'm from the Dub but that ain't how I roll<br/>
<br/>
They say I am a fool cause I like to do my thing my own way<br/>
I gotta couple strikes against me one more and I'm on my way<br/>
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do I gotta get my bread<br/>
Keep my head it's either go to jail or get this money instead
