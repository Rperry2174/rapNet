<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever<br/>
Man, Soopafly never ever ever<br/>
Fell for the do no and you know I'm<br/>
Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez<br/>
It's too much for me to be givin' to you<br/>
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you<br/>
Now Sh????, I told the bitch to blaze the weed<br/>
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew<br/>
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar<br/>
And my room got knocked off in the car<br/>
Gave it to me until I reached my peak<br/>
Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week<br/>
I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast<br/>
You've been givin' up too much damn cock and givin up too much ass<br/>
Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that<br/>
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back<br/>
Ever since she tripped, I went on one<br/>
Stepped in the club, Caught me a homerun<br/>
Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call<br/>
I wanted to break that bitch like a law<br/>
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth<br/>
Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof<br/>
Then she said somethin bout the cost<br/>
Man, that same bus stop is where <br/>
I dropped that bitch back the fuck off<br/>
You can't ride my bird<br/>
So I kicked that bitch to the curb<br/>
You best to believe<br/>
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me<br/>
<br/>
You thought you had my grip<br/>
But Soopafly never ever slips<br/>
You thought you had my cash<br/>
Till I turned around and whupped yo' ass<br/>
....like a pimp and that's for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute<br/>
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on<br/>
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas<br/>
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest<br/>
She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama<br/>
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here<br/>
I like big bitches cause they large<br/>
And big bitches always take charge<br/>
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg<br/>
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll<br/>
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of<br/>
Got alot of cash for a little love<br/>
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall<br/>
Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg<br/>
I don't see a god damn thang<br/>
That's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring<br/>
It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger<br/>
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer<br/>
Your homegirl, bring her cause I've been dying to meet her<br/>
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her<br/>
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her<br/>
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her...<br/>
It was fun while it lasted<br/>
You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby<br/>
<br/>
You thought you had my grip<br/>
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips<br/>
You thought you had my cash<br/>
Until I turned around and whupped your ass<br/>
....trick beyotch beyotch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Too $hort]</i><br/>
I said beyyyotch, what are you smokin<br/>
A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland<br/>
There must be some kind of misunderstanding<br/>
Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz<br/>
You think a nigga rich, bitch<br/>
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick<br/>
For all the wrong reasons<br/>
Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season<br/>
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway<br/>
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday<br/>
I rolled to my house with the bitch<br/>
(What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick<br/>
Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable<br/>
You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe<br/>
So you might as well enjoy the ride<br/>
And serve this nigga from the eastside<br/>
How much for the game that I'm sellin'<br/>
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen<br/>
I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though<br/>
Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable<br/>
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'<br/>
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on<br/>
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent<br/>
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money<br/>
<br/>
You thought you had my grip<br/>
But Too $hort never ever slips<br/>
You thought you had my cash<br/>
Until I turned around and whupped your ass<br/>
....trick beyotch beyotch<br/>
<br/>
...I got family members, homeboys...<br/>
Muthafuckaz I look out way before you.
