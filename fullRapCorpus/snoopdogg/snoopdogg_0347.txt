<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
You know I'm tuned in with the best from the 213<br/>
This is DJ LOS<br/>
This is Long Beach moving Y'all<br/>
Get ready, get ready, get ready<br/>
Turn up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Nigga when we ride on them haters<br/>
Nigga when we slide, motivation<br/>
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach<br/>
213 is where I be at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Beach city, beach city, that's my claim to fame<br/>
Reminiscing, while I'm twisting, standing in the rain<br/>
I'm in the mixing game, all my joints get fit to pain<br/>
And I gripped the cane and I gripped the grain<br/>
And I only came to spit the game<br/>
Straight up out that Long Beach to Strong Beach<br/>
Sneak baby in the party with that long heat<br/>
At the wrong beach to play with<br/>
Stay with that mossburg, that KK<br/>
That chop-chop that whoop-whoop<br/>
That's spray day, that's mayday<br/>
Now Snoop do what he want to<br/>
I will do and I won't do<br/>
Slide up, ride up, fired up when I dump two<br/>
Now all it takes is one line but thanks to it flipped out<br/>
Long Beach, east side, yes sir we cripped out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So Nigga when we ride on them haters<br/>
Nigga when we slide, motivation<br/>
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach<br/>
213 is where I be, off of Long beach<br/>
213 is where I be, off of Long beach<br/>
If you wanna find me, nigga come to Long Beach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Classics, ain't giving out no passes<br/>
Get low or get gone you gonna end up getting blasted<br/>
So plastic it's drastic, but I'mma keep doing my part<br/>
I was raised up on the east side, born and bred at king park<br/>
After dark, no hooks, no marks, all G's<br/>
Dipped through the funk out and I graduated with all Cs<br/>
Sold dope and I made bread, never switch and that's real shit<br/>
Stay down from the playground and I always represent 20 crip<br/>
I'm so cool, old school when I paint pictures like Shoku<br/>
Ask anybody not just the homies, Snoop Dogg he been a fool<br/>
I really do I got heart and I got smart<br/>
Bad part, don't panic I'm on Atlantic<br/>
And yep, yep I got the Cannon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So nigga when we ride on them haters<br/>
Nigga when we slide, motivation<br/>
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach<br/>
213 is where I be, bitch off of Long beach<br/>
So nigga when we ride on them haters<br/>
Nigga when we slide, motivation<br/>
If you wanna find me, come to Long Beach<br/>
213 is where I be, off of Long beach
