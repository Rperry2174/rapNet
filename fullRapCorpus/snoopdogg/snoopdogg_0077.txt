Yeah<br/>
A little something for all the O.G.s out there<br/>
That put the foundation together<br/>
Was doin' this thang<br/>
Before I knew what to do with this thang right here<br/>
Ya know<br/>
But just to let them know what time it is<br/>
And how we get down<br/>
Me, Kokane, and Battlecat<br/>
Gone let y'all know how we do this thang here<br/>
Check this out y'all<br/>
<br/>
We stay on point like Stacey Adams<br/>
<br/>
24 hours a day,7 days a week, can ya dig it?<br/>
That's real talk baby<br/>
You know what<br/>
We stay on point like Stacey Adams<br/>
That's real talk right there baby<br/>
(Stacey Adams)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm in a 3 piece suit<br/>
Looking too cute<br/>
Mashin' flashin'<br/>
Lookin' for a prostitute<br/>
Boo boo, you got that loot<br/>
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me<br/>
It's all to the gravy cuz it's V.I.P<br/>
And everythang in here movin' belong to me<br/>
That component set, was given to me<br/>
By a pimp buddy of mine Disco D.<br/>
He told me, Frisco E.<br/>
This here gone be<br/>
The baddest pimp nigga that you ever gone see<br/>
Colder than Fillmore Slim<br/>
Tilt that brim<br/>
Snoop Dogg gone sell that trick<br/>
Keep it crackin' like pistachios<br/>
Get that money<br/>
And continue to mash these hoes<br/>
And when the Player's Ball roll around again<br/>
I'm guaranteed to win<br/>
You know why?<br/>
Cuz we<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
We stay on point like Stacey Adams<br/>
24 hours a day, 7 days a week<br/>
Yea, yea<br/>
<br/>
You know why?<br/>
We stay on point like Stacey Adams<br/>
You know that's all we know how to do<br/>
(Stacey Adams)<br/>
Gee'd up to the feet up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Not only that but uhh<br/>
Make it spectacular<br/>
Put on my black cape<br/>
And look like Blackula<br/>
Smack ya up with the shit that I drop<br/>
911, call the cops<br/>
There's a bitch, snitch<br/>
Ain't that a bitch<br/>
I can't trust nobody in this sonofabitch<br/>
I get rich on the fakers who hate<br/>
Bakin' my cake<br/>
And catch the Lakers at 8<br/>
On channel 9<br/>
Pop a bottle of wine<br/>
Then at 10 hit the club<br/>
With my nephew Dub<br/>
11:30, talkin' dirty to this little birdy<br/>
I'm trying to get mine early<br/>
I can't be seen with your girly<br/>
Continue to mash these hoes<br/>
I keep it crackin' like pistachios<br/>
I get the money first<br/>
With no rehearsal<br/>
Snoop D-O double G<br/>
Still controversial<br/>
Aahhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3x]</i>
