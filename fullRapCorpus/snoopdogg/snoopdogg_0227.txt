<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Fuck (fuck fuck...)<br/>
You know a nigga really don't wanna go to school today<br/>
Lemme call this bitch<br/>
Get my shit together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wiz &amp; Snoop]</i><br/>
When I pull up people so fresh in my ride<br/>
We smoke the best you can buy<br/>
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us<br/>
Keep stunting just cause I can<br/>
These hoes know just who I am<br/>
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
This one's for the g's all black Chuck's on the cuffs of my jeans<br/>
King size papes full of trees, I be with the boss dog(g) ya'll fuck niggas please<br/>
Now they say I'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees<br/>
Taking pictures with a young nigga cheese<br/>
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing<br/>
Now I'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing<br/>
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings<br/>
Jewelry froze, like fling<br/>
Money come fast, yours slow like lean<br/>
Rolling up grass, so weed to have the stash, so I know I'm gonna fast<br/>
Third period, showing up last<br/>
With a late note blowin' green smoke <i>[laughs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
We blow to the middle of the day<br/>
Wiz say dawg put the middle of the jay<br/>
Hey, why not? Not why?<br/>
<br/>
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high<br/>
Fuck it, everybody to the library<br/>
Got a new batch, some blue - booberry<br/>
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day<br/>
It's a mind game like the ream I seem to keep migraines<br/>
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter<br/>
My grass day off day off Ferris Bueller<br/>
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a zip away<br/>
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang, what you want dog<br/>
Shit I'm on everythang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You niggas never had and you never will<br/>
You niggas never had and you never will<br/>
I said you niggas never had and you never will<br/>
Big Snoop and Wiz smoke with the kill (kill kill)<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
You niggers still in high-school, elementary ass niggas<br/>
Holla at me when you graduate<br/>
We be posted right by the 400 building<br/>
Room 420<br/>
Follow your nose, your no-nose (ha-ha)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Niggas ain't hard like us<br/>
Niggas soft as doctors cock swab<br/>
You bitchin'<br/>
Smoke somethin'
