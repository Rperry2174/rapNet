(One, two...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Snoop]</i><br/>
Yeah, I like to dedicate this record right here to my main man<br/>
Johnny Cash, a real American gangster<br/>
I got my nephew Whitey Ford on the guitar<br/>
Young Trev' on the drums<br/>
Grand Ole Opry, here we come, uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick<br/>
Jacked up the spoon on the candlestick<br/>
Dopestick pimpin on the one-trick pony<br/>
Yeah she kinda skinny but she gets my money<br/>
Get my money, buy my medicine<br/>
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine<br/>
Get my money, buy my medicine<br/>
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know I got to have that medicine<br/>
That prescription medicine baby<br/>
Y'know, purple, orange, green<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Jack starts hangin 'round with some fiends<br/>
Got strung out, sold the cow for beans<br/>
Told young wifey, "I love ya honey<br/>
But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money"<br/>
Get my money, buy my medicine<br/>
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine<br/>
Get my money, buy my medicine<br/>
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the mo' dedicated the mo' medicated<br/>
Can you feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop - singing]</i><br/>
Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high<br/>
(And I'm high all day, every day)<br/>
You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Haha, yeah I lie sometimes<br/>
What's the use of the truth if you can't get a lie sometimes baby?<br/>
Now dig this<br/>
<br/>
Jack starts a track up and down the hill<br/>
Got to walkin thinkin ace what he told to Jill<br/>
Come rain, come shine, come snow or if it's sunny<br/>
Get the fuck out, come and get my money<br/>
Get my money, buy my medicine<br/>
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine<br/>
Get my money, buy my medicine<br/>
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
They say you can't buy me love, but you damn sure can buy me bud<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop - singing]</i><br/>
Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high<br/>
(Oh I'm so high right now, how 'bout you?)<br/>
You can trust every word I'm gonna tell you is a lie<br/>
(Liar liar, haha, pants on fire)<br/>
Girl I love you (I love you though)<br/>
Yeahhhh!
