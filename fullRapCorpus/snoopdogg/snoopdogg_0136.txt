<i>[Chorus - Pharrell Williams (Vanessa Marquez)]</i><br/>
Pass it, pass it - get it girl<br/>
Pass it, pass it - get it girl<br/>
Please don't be greedy! nooo!<br/>
Pass it, pass it - get it girl<br/>
Breathe it in! Now let go!<br/>
(La la la la la la la la la)<br/>
Breathe it in! Now let go!<br/>
(La la la la la la la la la)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Roll up a fat one and pass it around<br/>
Lay back hypnotized by The Neptunes sound<br/>
My peoples always see me and they think I'm on point<br/>
So they roll me a blunt, or either pass me a joint<br/>
I'm the modern day Rick James, yeah that's me<br/>
Anything less than the best is blasphemy<br/>
So ask for me - when you wanna get spliffted<br/>
I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted<br/>
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics<br/>
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted<br/>
With the berries and cherries, the high berries<br/>
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!<br/>
I took another hit and then my vision got blurry<br/>
I had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry<br/>
I'm looking at this chick, real thick, her name is Cheri<br/>
Big fat booty and her pootie was hairy, c'mon biatch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Nick nack patty wack, give a Dogg a bone<br/>
Naw don't gimme nothing but a handful of stones<br/>
Don't stop! I ain't finised yet<br/>
You say you got the bomb? You wanna make a bet? it's on!<br/>
I blew about three zones then took baby home<br/>
Nigga what?! Motherfucker I'm grown<br/>
I have it how I want it, did it done it and stunted<br/>
Fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted<br/>
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it<br/>
This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter<br/>
It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle<br/>
Everything is moving like you on a tricycle<br/>
You caught up in the pickle but I get you out<br/>
I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth<br/>
Slow down! hoe damn! you're doing too much<br/>
You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah this is classic, fantastic, I'm blasted<br/>
I've been growing and blowing, niggaz wonder how I lasted<br/>
Well, like Jesus I fasted, for 40 days and 40 nights<br/>
I got it all mastered<br/>
Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology<br/>
Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be<br/>
Real high, whenever writing my novelty<br/>
Because it adds to my celebrity<br/>
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated<br/>
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated<br/>
Then I created, you're happy that I made it<br/>
Take another hit, young nigga get faded<br/>
We're going all out, smoke till ya fall out<br/>
D-O double G House all in ya mouth<br/>
The West got the best, the East got the peace<br/>
I'm out and about with a blunt in my mouth, peace!<br/>
<br/>
