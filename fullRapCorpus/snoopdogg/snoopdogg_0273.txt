Early in the morning<br/>
Smoking them blunts<br/>
Jump up out my bed<br/>
What the fuck you want?<br/>
Roll me a <i>[?]</i><br/>
We <i>[?]</i><br/>
Twisted dreads in my head<br/>
Nigga just like that<br/>
Count my cheese up<br/>
Big big money<br/>
Oh, I'm on the move<br/>
Ain't a damn thing funny<br/>
I really don't lose much<br/>
When I'm in the streets nigga<br/>
Point <i>[?]</i> drugs<br/>
How the fuck you figure nigga<br/>
Yeah, I'm successful<br/>
Every single day, bitch<br/>
Admit it, I'm the best dog/doe<i>[?]</i><br/>
Just cause we rich trick<br/>
Always so fresh doe<br/>
Every single way<br/>
And represent the west coast<br/>
Every single day<br/>
Internationally known<br/>
All around the world<br/>
Hit me on the cell phone<br/>
I'll fuck your girl<br/>
And hit you right back<br/>
Then hang up in your face<br/>
Unless I'm getting sprayed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'll take my cake to go<br/>
Happy birthday<br/>
I'll take my cake to go<br/>
Happy birthday<br/>
What's your side girl?<br/>
Happy birthday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[?]</i> It's one of those days<br/>
A throwback Thursday<br/>
Wanna do it your way?<br/>
Burger King bitch<br/>
I told her she was special<br/>
Oh you know you're <i>[?]</i> one<br/>
Until she almost bust a vessel<br/>
Doctor, doctor<br/>
I told her, come on girl let's get it in<br/>
Cmon, get in<br/>
And cut out all the bitching<br/>
Hush yo mouth<br/>
Turn it up girl, and just listen<br/>
Bang bang<br/>
And a <i>[?]</i> gangster we got straight pimpin' <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro with Hook]</i>
