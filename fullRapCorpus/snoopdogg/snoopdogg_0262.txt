Playboy approach me wrong, this is why I shot<br/>

'Til everyone know my name the game don't stop<br/>
Now! Not! So I keep pumpin the block<br/>
Until I'm big as Rihanna and Mason's rock<br/>
While you love Sosa<br/>

Her ass alone man bigger than Oprah<br/>
Puerto Rican, Dominican first name Rosa<br/>
Anyway, let me explain one time<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
My money bigger than homie you funny niggas is phony<br/>
Tony told me he showed me so I gotta get mine<br/>
Let me just slip into the back of the wide <br/>
Open your eyes let your window down now you in the passenger side<br/>
Get in, now you get it, quit it and with it<br/>
Waan come test me now tell 'em the Lion did it<br/>
And bit 'em off a chip of the block of the wood<br/>
Lil' homie couldn't rock if he could click cockin and pull<br/>
Hip hopin over lot of the bull more pull<br/>
And yes, I am paid and full<br/>
Fa schizzay, my nizzay, Erick D-i-iznay!<br/>
That's all I'm a sizznay, okizzay<br/>
'Cause I'm too mean too cool too cold too slick<br/>
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Method Man]</i><br/>
Yo! Like a room full of black of raw heat<br/>
They see the flow back gettin all geek, It's like I'm Pete Charles I'm all street<br/>
They come in time money but talk cheap<br/>
But rappers wanna kick it I'm all feet<br/>
Every line artistic that's all me, my man's son autistic that's so key<br/>
The why go and get it I'm so G<br/>
That's why I wear the fitted so low key, that's why I kill the critic for no fee<br/>
Then tell the judge I did it and go free<br/>
E double E my co-d<br/>
Let's throw the book at 'em what's yo' plea?<br/>
Guilty as charged that's how it is when your guilty and charged<br/>
Took a bunch of Def, artist and built me a Squad<br/>
What's today's math? Build with the God, weed, women and cars<br/>
Lock the game down I'm givin 'em bars<br/>
What is life if you ain't livin it large? If you ain't livin it large<br/>
Go get the price checked and get you a job<br/>
But wait<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: RL (Sample from Kevin Hart)]</i><br/>
Hey! Hey! Let me explain this<br/>
Hey! Hey! Let me explain this<br/>
Hey! Hey! (SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)<br/>
(LIL' ASS NIGGA! SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Erick Sermon &amp; RL]</i><br/>
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!<br/>
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!<br/>
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!<br/>

<i>[Outro: RL]</i><br/>
