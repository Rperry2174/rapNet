<i>[Chorus: Tray Deee]</i><br/>
I'm tired of that punk shit<br/>
Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit<br/>
I bang it to the tip-top<br/>
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks<br/>
To the last drip-drop<br/>
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks<br/>
I'm knowin that this shit hot<br/>
This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
It's time to research the documents and pull some files<br/>
and put it down with this gangsta style<br/>
Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now<br/>
after peace treaty meetings and the weapons down<br/>
Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals<br/>
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless<br/>
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep<br/>
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check<br/>
Certified murder guide through the streets of death<br/>
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met<br/>
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash<br/>
Niggaz have done did when the steel'll blast<br/>
Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag<br/>
Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs<br/>
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock<br/>
Lick shots and the cops and control your block<br/>
Keep it true with the crew from the old to new<br/>
Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do<br/>
Notice who, participatin all the activity<br/>
That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies<br/>
So death to all my enemies<br/>
And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy<br/>
These weak niggaz killin me<br/>
with their proclivity to even proclimate that they as real as me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga this crip, crip, crip<br/>
Talk shit and I'ma bust yo' lip<br/>
I'm gettin chips in the summer in a nine-six Hummer<br/>
in D.C., fuckin with a breezy, easy<br/>
See we see all we can see<br/>
G.R. we can G, the Eastside family<br/>
Coherent, cohesive, the co-pilot<br/>
On this Eastside shit cuz, I'm co-signin<br/>
On the East fuck peace we ridin violent<br/>
Fuck where you been it's all about where I been<br/>
Sirens, gunshots, flood glocks get popped<br/>
when they all try to knock knock knock<br/>
Who is it - visit the papers, the streets and the labels<br/>
We got the hottest shit burnin on the turntables<br/>
I won't deny ya, I'm a straight rider<br/>
and you don't wanna fuck with me (yeh yeh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
C.. R.. I.. P.. cause that's all we G<br/>
I'm from Rollin', 20, Gangsta Crip<br/>
and I'ma tell you how the shit gon' C (gon' C)<br/>
Now if I wasn't rappin motherfucker y'all be starvin<br/>
on my nuts without bucks like Marvin<br/>
You can't sleep, you can't eat, look who starvin<br/>
Written bill paid but still gotta be a slave<br/>
Flip your own money, make your own proper<br/>
Get yo' own heat, in case some niggaz try to stop ya<br/>
Be a boss hog about your money, float loc<br/>
And trust no one, anybody can get smoke smoked<br/>
like a fat-ass blunt, of that bomb shit<br/>
Have a babysitter set that ass up for chip Chips Ahoy!<br/>
Niggaz ran in with toys<br/>
If you didn't see 'em it's the Eastside boys<br/>
We be mobbin, like a motherfuckin cut<br/>
Dirty dealt, lil' sag, lil' jay, lil' Chuck<br/>
Two times, trey times on yo' motherfuckin ass<br/>
Keep it O.G. nigga, rewind and pass<br/>
It's just another day and forty dozen, niggaz strugglin<br/>
Is you hustlin, do you relate to drug smugglin?<br/>
If so, grab a nine and start to trip<br/>
But remember, don't let nobody punk you out yo' grip nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LaToiya Williams]</i><br/>
Dogg Pound groovin, Eastside is the greatest<br/>
and other guys can't fade us<br/>

And all you suckers hate it<br/>
Ohh crip is goin down<br/>
And baby have no doubt, we gonna turn it out<br/>
