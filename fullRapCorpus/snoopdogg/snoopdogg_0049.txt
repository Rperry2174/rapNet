<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade<br/>
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade<br/>
I to school from my moms apartment<br/>
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit<br/>
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost<br/>
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force<br/>
My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz<br/>
In front of his building witht the rest of his friends<br/>
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand<br/>
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man<br/>
I go upstairs, I hug my mother<br/>
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother<br/>
I sit down on the bed to watch some t.v.<br/>
<i>[Gun Shots]</i> Do my ears decieve me<br/>
No That's the fourth time this week<br/>
Four young brothers got shot in the street<br/>
The very next day while I'm off to class<br/>
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass<br/>
My sisters cute but shes got no gear <br/>
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share<br/>
So there in school I made a fool<br/>
With one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool<br/>
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else<br/>
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf<br/>
Now everyday I see my momma struggling<br/>
So now its time I got to do something<br/>
I look for work<br/>
I get dissed like a jerk<br/>
I do odd jobs <br/>
And come home like a slob<br/>
So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery<br/>
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery<br/>
I do it once I do it twice<br/>
And now there's stake with the beans and rice<br/>
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal<br/>
My sisters gear now has sex appeal<br/>
My brothers my partner and were getting paper<br/>
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors<br/>
My family's happy and everything is new<br/>
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chours]</i><br/>
Doggz Gonna Get Ya <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Talking]</i><br/>
Ay yo yo Check this out Snoop<br/>
All these niggas always talking about<br/>
"They looove this" And niggas got looove for you<br/>
Or nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga<br/>
You niggas dont know what the fuck love really mean<br/>
Nigga you cant buy love at no corner store nigga<br/>
Love aint got no price tag<br/>
Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
hmm<br/>
Money is flowing everything is fine<br/>
I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine<br/>
Business is booming everyhing is cool<br/>
I pull about a G a week, fuck school<br/>
A year passed by and I began to grow<br/>
Not in height but juice and cash flow<br/>
I kick up my feet to watch some t.v.<br/>
Cause now I got other people working for me<br/>
I got a 55" television you know<br/>
And every once in a while I hear "Just say no"<br/>
Or the other commercial I love<br/>
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs<br/>
I pick up the remote control and just turn<br/>
Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned<br/>
Me and my brother bounced in the Benz<br/>
We driving around our territory again<br/>
I pull up at the light like a superstar<br/>
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car<br/>
I hit the accellerater scared as shit<br/>
I drove one block to find my brother was hit<br/>
He wasnt dead but the blood was pouring<br/>
And all I could think about was Warren<br/>
Later I found it was Dogg and his crew<br/>
Now tell mw what the fuck am I suppose to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chours x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Talking]</i><br/>
Yeah so now you see what I'm talkin bout nigga<br/>
You see what that love shit do ya<br/>
This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother<br/>
So what the fuck you gone do now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
My brother s out of it but I'm still in it<br/>
On top of that I'm in it to win it<br/>
I cant believe that Dogg would dis me<br/>
That faggot that punk he soft or sissy<br/>
I driving around with three of my guys<br/>
The war is on and I'm on the rise<br/>
We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out<br/>
What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out<br/>
Someone shot back so we took cover<br/>
And all i could about was my brother<br/>
Dogg jumped up and began to run<br/>
Bustin shots hopping to hit someone<br/>
So I just stopped and let off three shot<br/>
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop<br/>
I threw down the gun and began to shout<br/>
"Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out<br/>
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue<br/>
They pointin they guns at my four man crew <br/>
They shot down one, they shot down two<br/>
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chours x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Talking]</i><br/>
Ya see the moral of the story is this<br/>
Love is a motherfucka<br/>
And Doggs is a motherfucka<br/>
You mix the two up you bound to get some drama<br/>
Loves gonna get ya<br/>
Naw nigga Doggz gonna get ya you ever try to play me and thats real<br/>
Thats real<br/>
Thats real
