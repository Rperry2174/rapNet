These are the tales, the freaky tales<br/>
These are the tales that I tell so well<br/>
These are the tales, the freaky tales<br/>
These are the tales that I tell so well<br/>
I met this girl, her name was Joan<br/>
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone<br/>
When I met Joan, I took her home<br/>
She was just like a doggie all on my bone<br/>
I met another girl, her name was Ann<br/>
All she wanted was to freak with a man<br/>
When I met Ann, I shook her hand<br/>
We ended up freakin by a garbage can<br/>
The next young freak, I met was Red<br/>
I took her to my house and she gave me head<br/>
She like blowin dicks, is all she said<br/>
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed<br/>
There's another girl, her name is Sherry<br/>
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary<br/>
I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry<br/>
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry<br/>
Young and tender, sweet Denise<br/>
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast<br/>
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece<br/>
She'll only start talkin bout signin a lease<br/>
I met a young tender, her name is Lori<br/>
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story<br/>
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa<br/>
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser<br/>
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle<br/>
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale<br/>
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well<br/>
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell<br/>
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi<br/>
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly?<br/>
She had a best friend, her name was Janet<br/>
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game<br/>
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan<br/>
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam<br/>
The very next day, I saw her with her man<br/>
One week passed, and I was in her again<br/>
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine<br/>
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen<br/>
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend<br/>
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans<br/>
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy<br/>
I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me<br/>
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta<br/>
A country broad from Alabama<br/>
I met this freak, her name was Beth<br/>
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death<br/>
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat<br/>
but I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath<br/>
Bake, and, shake, ups<br/>
I met this freak in Vegas<br/>
She she said her name was Don-na<br/>
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na<br/>
I said, "I don't pimp, or gigolo<br/>
I'm havin so much paper I don't need a hoe<br/>
You can break yourself, but you can't break me<br/>
You never met a player like Snoop baby"<br/>
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe<br/>
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'<br/>
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'<br/>
She was down on her knees, beggin to blow<br/>
She's like another freak, named Renee<br/>
You get her all alone and she'll make your day<br/>
Like Burger King, she knows the play<br/>
and with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way<br/>
These are the tales, the freaky tales<br/>
These are the tales that I tell so well<br/>
These are the tales, the freaky tales<br/>
These are the tales that I tell so well!
