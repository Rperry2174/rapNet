<i>[Rick Rock:]</i><br/>
I wear my heart on my sleeve, but it's a purple heart (purple heart)<br/>
North bay, water mammals, known with killer sharks (killer sharks)<br/>
I'm from the 7-O-7, it's no heaven (it's no heaven)<br/>
I'm a Top 5 Mobb, Hi-fi veteran (Hi-fi veteran)<br/>
Ricky Rock my nigga, I got slaps (got slaps)<br/>
You can play him for hours, back to back (back to back)<br/>
Niggas on your team that love that money over everything<br/>
Can never be loyal, now take that back to the soil<br/>
Anywhere on earth, and it'll work<br/>
I'm just sharing my experience I lurk for what it's worth<br/>
Maybe it's a <i>[?]</i> 'cause I don't trust y'all<br/>
I'm in a love, caught some grapes in a buzz ball, trippin' like<br/>
Look at this shit here (here)<br/>
This sucker shit is running rampant, it's the moment I fear<br/>
<br/>
It was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Ricky is tricky, the game is gettin' slippery<br/>
This shit is a maze, cuz singing like a Tempree<br/>
I disappear for one minute 'til they miss me<br/>
Another TV show, more dough, I'm makin' history<br/>
Now I'm back at your service<br/>
Wish me luck dear, I'm scared and I'm nervous<br/>
You never left you brought that hood back with ya<br/>
I'm the real deal, I ain't got bullshit with ya<br/>
Another one I wanna make, another joint I wanna make<br/>
Open up and put some candles on my dick<br/>
Twenty-five and countin', adds my face in the Kushmore Mountain<br/>
Can't be scared of your pony dawg, own if you want it, trip this<br/>
This sucker shit is running rampant, it's the moment I fear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Rock:]</i><br/>
It was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
My nigga it was the moment I fear<br/>
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I fear
