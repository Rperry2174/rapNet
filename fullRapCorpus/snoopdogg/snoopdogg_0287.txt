You know I'm doin' big thangs for me<br/>
Got big thangs, you know what I mean?<br/>
You don't even understand it you know what I mean?<br/>
Big riches it's a blessin'<br/>
Anyway, check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I ain't having big things, ain't it man?<br/>
You know I'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?<br/>
Ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?<br/>
And smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?<br/>
And I never been in love before, ain't it man?<br/>
A gangsta nigga on his throne, ain't it man?<br/>
You know I'm doing big things, ain't it man?<br/>
You know I'm about that good thang, ain't it man?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Twist up a swisha sweety put some foul in that bitch<br/>
Lets get wild<br/>
Lets get high<br/>
Come on, lets take a few hits<br/>
Sip some drink, count yo bank or do whatever you feel<br/>
Pop the top on yo lacker, is that a Snoopy deal?<br/>
It's got to be Monopoly it's how I play on this field<br/>
A quarterback with the sack, I got a team to build<br/>
A Dream to fill, scheme for mills, wheels and deals<br/>
Do how I feel, don't give a fuck how I feel<br/>
And that's for real<br/>
A lot of pimp niggas be poppin' up<br/>
Ever since me and Magic Juan made it popular<br/>
Pimpin' ain't easy, for sheezy, my neezy, cuff your breezy<br/>
And remember this nigga when you see me<br/>
<br/>
You know I'm doing big things, ain't it man?<br/>
You know I'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?<br/>
Ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?<br/>
And I smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?<br/>
Oh, waaaah, ain't it man? <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane:]</i><br/>
Jacob fella stay fly, everyday gaters laced up<br/>
I ain't thinking a pay cut, this beat is paper chaser<br/>
You work from 9 to 5, but I'mma keep a steady hustle<br/>
Yeah, we doin' big thangs, a nigga gotta have some muscle<br/>
Always keep it low, keepa ain't afraid to knuckle up<br/>
If ya disrespect my pimpin', tryna fuck my hustle up<br/>
I'm just here to kick game, get on the mike, spit flames<br/>
Big Snoop Dog with Kokane, ain't a man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E-White:]</i><br/>
Catch me lookin' flossy, I done hooked up wit the boss and<br/>
Where he got his share of thrust is not my fault<br/>
I'm handsome enough without the clothes and the <i>[?]</i><br/>
But I'm rough, bossin' up on all them hoes, think I'm a star<br/>
I hustle and I call it like I see it, can't sleep<br/>
I need some money, stressed out, I'm about to fight<br/>
Bite off that weed or somethin'<br/>
To make it happen is the mission that they send me to get wit<br/>
Not all fall out dawg house, I represent this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
