I’m here now nigger yeah, you’ve been waiting on me to bust on this beat.<br/>
So let me go ahead and do my thing.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve got one all ready. <br/>
You can smoke on the jeezy<br/>
Imma smoke on the bleezy<br/>
Nigger take it easy<br/>
Big Snoop heezy all-in the place let the beat go bang and turnup the bass<br/>
Imma give it to you live and direct on stage <br/>
cuz imma different nigger when I hit that stage<br/>
My name is Snoop Dogg and you can turn the page<br/>
Kick that shit like a 12-gage<br/>

Motherfucker get close to the shit that I bang like<br/>
Snoop Dogg is on the microphone and I came like<br/>
This is that good shit straight from my brain like<br/>
Nigger gettin’ close try to pitch in frame like<br/>
<br/>
Don’t get close cuz I represent the coast<br/>
Burn a nigger like a breakfast toast<br/>
Yes indeed I procceed <br/>
And I’m in Amsterdam blowing weed<br/>
With my niggers<br/>
<br/>
We gettin’ money, money, money, money, money, money, money<br/>
We gettin’ money, money, money, money, money, money, money<br/>
<br/>
Let me break it down like this<br/>
<br/>
See, see to get money is a small thing for me<br/>
To get money is a big thing for you<br/>
But you don’t get it like I get it cuz your name ain’t Snoop<br/>
And you don’t roll around in a 78’ coupe<br/>
<br/>
With the windows lay that<br/>
Laidback<br/>
With a bad bitch holding on my<br/>
Litt that<br/>
Yeah I'm bout to do that<br/>
And rear that<br/>
And clear that<br/>
And do it to you just like did that <br/>
<br/>
Boom bam<br/>
Cuz I go like that <br/>
I make a motherfucker wanna flow like that<br/>
I take it back to the store like that<br/>
Bust your bitch and make her wanna hold like that<br/>
Cuz I’m all about cheese<br/>
Snoop Dogg D O dubble G<br/>
I am the one and only S N dubble O P D O dubble G why from the LBC<br/>
<br/>
And I get money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money<br/>
<br/>
Let me break it down for you one time<br/>
<br/>
Green is for the money<br/>
Green is for the book<br/>
Green is for the shit I’ve been doing in the club<br/>
Green is for the people that been down with me<br/>
And green is for the motherfucking DPG<br/>
<br/>
We get it all the time<br/>
Never ever faking the font<br/>
And green is for the shit I’ve been put in my blunt<br/>
And green is for the motherfucker standing on the side ones Snoop gets a touchdown <br/>
And screamout East-side<br/>
<br/>
money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
