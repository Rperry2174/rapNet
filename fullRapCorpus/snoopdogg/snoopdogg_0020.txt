<i>[Intro/Chorus: Charlie Wilson]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle (Ain't it funky nuff?)<br/>
(Death Row-ow, Death Rowwwww)<br/>
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Shucks, stompin in my big blue chucks<br/>
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditchin you clutz<br/>
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumpin your sounds<br/>
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around<br/>
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free<br/>
and get down, stompin grounds is the LBC<br/>
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked<br/>
but now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap<br/>
Watch your head, I break wit<br/>
wit G's, Muslims, hardheads and dreds<br/>
Bounce, rock while rollerskatin<br/>
on them 20 inch tyres wit the platinum Daytons<br/>
I'm not that BG poppin all that junk<br/>
about "I'll fuck you up", he sound like a punk<br/>
I been there and done that, no inspiration<br/>
All day illustration beat conversation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond<br/>
Been workin on ya new album for two years strong<br/>
and still can't come up with the right song<br/>
You know what they say:'Study long, study long'<br/>
All aboard the train so come along<br/>
cos we keep the glue stuff against the bone<br/>
It's alright ain't no room for wrong<br/>
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home<br/>
I got money loads by the barrels<br/>
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro<br/>
I'm international money maker, player hater<br/>
shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler<br/>
at a player though cos players know the real from the fake<br/>
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state<br/>
I give you people what you like<br/>
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x1 1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Killin up crews, give em the real street blues<br/>
Have em slidin in their eelskins, groovin in their tennis shoes<br/>
Of course it don't stop bein a Westside ridah<br/>
Wit no tattoo that's how they got the clue<br/>
I lay conversation on wax and CD's<br/>
BG's and o-riginals, here come the mission<br/>
Makin biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season<br/>
Doggy DPG ya lil homey, uhh<br/>
I represent the LBC-ment<br/>
Windows tint, nigga that's the president<br/>
I hit you with a tune every blue moon<br/>
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face<br/>
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate<br/>
It taste like it's laced but it ain't<br/>
This one puff uncut, no doubt<br/>
Everybody know I gotta ounce and a half<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x1 1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Shucks<br/>
(Oooh ooh ooohhh oooohhhh ooh, oooh oooh oooohhhh ooh)<br/>
(Death Rowwww, Death Rowwww)<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i>
