<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ohhhhhhhh ohhh ohhhhh ohh<br/>
It could all be so, it could all be so<br/>
It could all be so easy<br/>
So, so easy, so easy<br/>
Yeah, hey hey hey hey, listen!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1:]</i><br/>
It could be easy, it could be easy<br/>
It could be easy...<br/>
It could be easy, it could be easy<br/>
It could be easy...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yeah, high school man<br/>
Taylor Gang, young Khalifa<br/>
I'll show you how to do this shit, uhh<br/>
<br/>
(It could be easy) But you probably won't believe me<br/>
That's why I'm smokin, ridin listenin to "DoggyStyle" on CD<br/>
They saw me on TV, now they gon' try they hardest to be me<br/>
Said she know just who I am and plus my team is undefeated<br/>
I'm the man in my city, if you want I got the key<br/>
and I could put you on the game or on the ocean by the beach<br/>
Everything you see I own, I don't gotta lease<br/>
If your bitch outta control better put that hoe on a leash<br/>
Umm (it could be easy) if you listen to what I'm tryin to tell ya<br/>
Every dime pays but they catch you messin with that high grade <br/>
they gon' try and fail ya - call up moms, tell her<br/>
you in the hallway, plus your clothes smell kinda familiar<br/>
I ain't trippin, I'm twistin up another one<br/>
Got a couple problems with my bitches dawg cause pimpin ain't (easy)<br/>
I'm rollin up trees, stayin low from police<br/>
And don't ask where I been, Dogg I'm goin where the G's be<br/>
Haters talk when I leave, they just front when they see<br/>
what they want, say they don't but they need me<br/>
I'm like a fuckin Game Genie<br/>
Young nigga but I make it look easy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
It could be easy<br/>
But the smallest little things we make so hard<br/>
Make so hard, make so hard<br/>
Yeah just like a free throw, life it be so easy<br/>
It could be easy<br/>
Well then tell me would you really be who you are?<br/>
Who you are, who you are<br/>
And it's been done before, I think you should know, know, know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz - over Chorus 2]</i><br/>
Hahahaha, I got class nigga fuck that I'm tired<br/>
I'm tired of fuckin around man<br/>
I'ma go to fuckin class man<br/>
I'll get at y'all niggaz later<br/>
This shit easier than it look man<br/>
Real shit, I'm gettin money too<br/>
Stayin fly, fuckin yo' bitch<br/>
What up Dogg?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[singer]</i><br/>
It can all be so easy<br/>
It could be easy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Flyin on a plane plane, dippin to this thang, bang<br/>
Never the same gang, she ask me if I gang bang<br/>
If Peter Piper pick 'em, then Snoopy Doopy pimp 'em<br/>
The track is where I kick 'em, now baby suck a dick up<br/>
until you start to hiccup, now look here breezy<br/>
It's real hard, but you can make it easy<br/>
I am pleasurable, now baby please me<br/>
And once I get up in it, I'll make you need me<br/>
(It could be easy) Like I love weed leaf<br/>
Baby starvin, now she feed me, believe me, you complete me<br/>
Protect the spot, and when I'm in school<br/>
Lay low, be cool, connect the dots, I do it vagrantly<br/>
Truant agencies on my wingtips<br/>
I ditched English, for Olde English<br/>
40-ounce loc, with some buddha Thai, mix it with some kush slow<br/>
With a E.T. high, so, I'ma phone home<br/>
Baby on some knick-knack, paddy-whack, give her Doggy bone<br/>
We +Home Alone+, now she's suckin on my bone<br/>
Macaulay, Phifer, NASCAR driver<br/>
Rollin with a real Eastsider<br/>
It could be easy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2 + Chorus 1 + Chorus 2 w/ ad libs]</i>
