Hear me knockin, I’ll be knockin on your door<br/>
Hear me knockin, I’ll be knockin on your door<br/>
<br/>
I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I just got one question to ask, do you love me? love me<br/>
You said you do but I’m not sure if you love me, love me<br/>
I just got to know right now do you really love me? do you really love me?<br/>
<br/>
I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Insecurity, be askin heavy questions, heavy questions<br/>
Don’t know why I feel this deep expression, expression<br/>
It’s so heavy heavy on my face and my mind<br/>
I keep letting it spoil my grind<br/>
Just got to go, it’s that time<br/>
<br/>
I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
L-O-V-E<br/>
Do-you-love-me?<br/>
L-O-V-E<br/>
Do-you-love-me?<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna know, do you really really care?<br/>
Just wanna know will you always be there?<br/>
Will you always be there?<br/>
Or is this a con to get what you want<br/>
Cus you really don’t care<br/>
<br/>
I just need you near me<br/>
Hear me, feel me homie, love me only<br/>
And if you can do that for me<br/>
Hold me back like you owe me<br/>
Click clock, hip-hop<br/>
Ready or not?<br/>
<br/>
Ready or not not not not not not here<br/>
Ready or not not not, that means ready or not<br/>
Ready or not not not not not not here<br/>
Ready or not not not, that means ready or not<br/>
<br/>
Not not not not not not here<br/>
Not not not, that means ready or not<br/>
Not not not not not not here<br/>
Not not not, I’ll make love to you girl<br/>
<br/>
I just got one question to ask, do you love me? (do you love me?) <i>[x4]</i>
