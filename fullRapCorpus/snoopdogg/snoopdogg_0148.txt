<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Ten little Crip niggaz runnin outside<br/>
All from the turf and they bangin out lives<br/>
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside<br/>
Where they don't die they just multiply<br/>
So.. don't give them niggaz a reason<br/>
To turn it into spray season<br/>
Don't give them niggaz a reason<br/>
Because they'll turn it into Crip season<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
The gangsta's back, the bank is fat<br/>
The gangsta mack, in a gangsta 'llac<br/>
Hmm.. fools be like, "Break off some cheese"<br/>
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please<br/>
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up<br/>
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked<br/>
It's all similar to gettin laaaid<br/>
on ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays<br/>
I grind for my shine about my bidness<br/>
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)<br/>
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease<br/>
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em<br/>
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy<br/>
Seventeen years old and still a baby<br/>
Gangstas real, they pop the pill<br/>
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit<br/>
Fuck a honey dip.. 'cause I got money to get<br/>
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this<br/>
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this<br/>
Keep a strap in ya pocket when ya tip through the towns<br/>
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down<br/>
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang<br/>
If ya money right then you might get you a chain<br/>
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go<br/>
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show<br/>
So mean, so green, crip back to the block<br/>
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got<br/>
It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)<br/>
And they thought we just gangsta rapped<br/>
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps<br/>
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)<br/>
It's like that!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside<br/>
On the Eastside, nigga we ride<br/>
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside<br/>
On the Eastside, nigga we ride<br/>
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside<br/>
On the Eastside, nigga we ride<br/>
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside<br/>
Eastside, yeah nigga we ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg (singing)]</i><br/>
They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun<br/>
I can't walk down the street without my gun, gun
