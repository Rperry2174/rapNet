Kids get your parents permision befor.fore.befo.fo.before tryin' this,<br/>
<br/>
Half of the hoes and the music goin bang<br/>
Everybody everybody yeh we all doin everything<br/>
So u kno wats happenin, there no need to pitty-pat<br/>
Dogg in this motherfucker, yeh I get da kitty-kat<br/>
Swervin on da one-ten blowin on some herb<br/>
One hand on the steerin wheel the other up her mini skirt<br/>
Tryna get some pussy while I'm pushin my wherree<br/>
Funny thing about it is that I'm fuck your bitch<br/>
Ok yo, hoe lay low, get mayo, like OJ yo, say hoe<br/>
Plug it in, pull it out, put it in, wat it is, that's wat it's all about<br/>
Now wat would I be if I let a punk motherfucker run up on me<br/>
I play chess checkmate him in the street, 32 fever off blast that's three<br/>
Swish swish fresh fish ain't that a bitch, like ray-jay I gotta run which<br/>
Look at the place I'm in, I never fuck superhead acam crawdashier<br/>
It's a discrace to yourself, dogg is the champ to the face with the belt<br/>
I'm undefeated, undisputed, persicuted, spaded and neutered; faded and booted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you<br/>
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you<br/>
We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you<br/>
We got that chronic chronic, we got that wateva u do<br/>
<br/>
Put ya hands in the sky, stick up, pick up piece of american pie<br/>
Wat kind of car do ya drive?<br/>
Suicide doors on the passenger side?<br/>
Do the windows roll down? do the doors lift high?<br/>
Do the car change colour when that bitch drive by?<br/>
I don't really know an I don't really care<br/>
Cause me and my money's like sonny and cher<br/>
Spend dow at the goochy store<br/>
I never spend dow on the coochy though<br/>
<br/>
You can check it, I got a record in brazil<br/>
For runnin out and not payin the bitches<br/>
Juvinial delinquint, see when I speak dis<br/>
Move when I bleep dis<br/>
Lil nigga peep dis<br/>
Ya secrets is all exposed<br/>
<br/>
If ya grew up on ma music<br/>
Ya mumma's one of ma hoes<br/>
Ya daddy's one of ma foe's<br/>
Ya granny's been to one of ma shows<br/>
<br/>
It is contrary that my literachary<br/>
Is very nesesary, ya feel me?<br/>
An you can try to rewind it, define it<br/>
Deside it to a whole notha groove<br/>
Play it to anotha move<br/>
Hope ya go through<br/>
Cause ya won't strike two<br/>
With twelve jury's up your piers<br/>
You better hope they like you<br/>
Ain't no tellin wat they might do<br/>
So I'm gonna just stay out their mothafucka way view<br/>
Dippin in an outta town<br/>
Gotta get a hundred thou<br/>
Even if it's just for a setta<br/>
<br/>
I been blessed by kings and kissed by queens<br/>
Even got a homie named prince akeem<br/>
Yes, I mean black diamonds<br/>
I can have anything, yep<br/>
There's twenty game<br/>
Even if I coulda of I would of never stopped<br/>
Started on the bottom, now they got him on the top<br/>
Sensation, big snoop dogg rattin number one in the nation<br/>
Top draft pick, always got a top bad bitch<br/>
Every time u see me, niggas wanna be me<br/>

Believe me.<br/>

We got that chronic chronic, we got that yack yack for you<br/>
We got that chronic chronic, we got that wateva u do
