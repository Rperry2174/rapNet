<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg singing (2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's a gangsta gangsta ride<br/>
On the nutty danger side<br/>
As we ride, dip and slippin<br/>
Take your mind, on a high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Silkk the Shocker]</i><br/>
Yo yo, from that DPG nigga to the CP3<br/>
Back to the house, East to the West<br/>
Now take it BACK to the South<br/>
You know.. how I switch my flow<br/>
If I'm lapsin you glad niggaz'll get mad then, hit the flo'<br/>
Gotta bag me some dank so I, hit the sto'<br/>
In the winter it's the Hummer for the summer it's the, six-fo'<br/>
Got niggaz mad at me (why?)  Cause they can't get no six<br/>
Bitches upset with me (why?)  Cause they can't get no dick<br/>
I'ma be on top of the game whether I'm, broke or rich<br/>
I don't stop once I'm on top I just drop mo' hits<br/>
I'm in the club with the thug, I just pop mo' Crist'<br/>
Tell Snoop to get the Coupe his new shit I just, gots to go get<br/>
Cause when I cock my shit, usually I pop my shit<br/>
Tell all you teary eyed females gettin over-offended<br/>
cause I don't jock no chick<br/>
I'm the Boss, and I don't follow no person, I follow Jesus<br/>
Y'all blame a bunch of kids, so I gotta roll my Adidas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Boom bam as I step in the jam, god damn<br/>
Don't need no introduction, cause you know who I am<br/>
The S-N-double-O-P, the only, fo' sho'<br/>
Now motherfuckers let me hear you say hoe<br/>
I spit ya, spat at ya, whoot wham, get at ya<br/>
Rider, I threw a slider, right at ya<br/>
Mash ya, gat ya, drip-drop the hatchet<br/>
Keep the party crackin, while I'm steady rappin<br/>
This game we run, y'all know what's happenin<br/>
We back in effect, we got the heat on deck<br/>
I'm slidin down South with a blunt in my mouth<br/>
I catch a plane out East and try to make some peace<br/>
I'm hangin with my niggaz in the projects<br/>
The homie's throwin a party, I gotta get back West<br/>
Oh yeah -- that's right, we are the best<br/>
No Limit DPG Southwest connects, ya feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Keep it gangsta<br/>
Keep it gangsta, keep it gangsta dogg<br/>
Keep it, keep it gangsta dogg<br/>
Yeah, we keep it gangsta dogg<br/>
Fo' sho', we keep it gangsta dogg, what?<br/>
Yeah, I wanna say whattup to all them gangstas <br/>
out there on the Eastisde<br/>
(on the Southside, on the Northside) Yeah<br/>
(on the Westside)<br/>
Y'all niggaz need to point the guns in the right directions<br/>
Ya know, ya heard?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop and Silkk talk to outro]</i>
