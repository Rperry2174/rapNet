<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Hey yo, Soopafly<br/>
These niggaz act like they don't know my motherfuckin' name (gangsta)<br/>
Hmm...ain't that a trip<br/>
Now I put half these niggaz on (ain't that something)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Snoop D-O double G (from the DP)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Niggaz wasn't even rapping till I came out<br/>
You know what I'm sayin?<br/>
Y'all know what time it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Every nigga in this rap game, to the dope game<br/>
Now I got the hook up on the dodo, for sure tho'<br/>
But I'm not a weed seller, but a crocka sack beller<br/>
A rap star plus a 2 time felon<br/>
Sellin' phones out the trunk I mix G with funk<br/>
I put it all together, and rock it till it chump<br/>
Then bag it up and sag it up and then serve<br/>
I'm always on the pager, never on the curb<br/>
I'm big time, get mine, stay down for the grizind<br/>
I keep it gangsta, nigga, all the tizime<br/>
Ask them niggaz, from way down South (who?)<br/>
The boys right there with the gold in they mouth<br/>
They'll tell ya (tell ya)<br/>
There ain't no bullshit to sell ya<br/>
Snoop D-O double G who wannabes wannabe<br/>
I got love for my folkers out in 'Lejo<br/>
And all my soldiers gettin' busy down in N-O<br/>
Gangsta's, get respect from me<br/>
And all you other niggaz gettin' checked by me<br/>
That's on the C, DPG will never break up<br/>
There's too much motherfuckin' paper to cake up<br/>
That's on me (DPG)<br/>
Now what?<br/>
I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now all the bitches if you with me, come get me<br/>
I'm in room 210, don't forget to bring the gin<br/>
That's the old fashion way, and bring a friend with ya<br/>
So when I'm through with ya she can hit ya<br/>
Shit I ain't trippin'<br/>
I'm dippin'<br/>
There's money to be made<br/>
It's funny how she layed when I told her she couldn't stay<br/>
Look here, my boo'll be through<br/>
So you gotta raise, boy game pays<br/>
On the next phase, gotta show to do at 4<br/>
Then I'm headed right back to the studio<br/>
If you need the hook up<br/>
Give a nigga a holla<br/>
I slide through your hood, in the gold impala<br/>
Drop off a sack, then I head right back<br/>
And I hope I don't get jacked, cause you know I'm ridin' strapped<br/>
But if the boys decide to pull me over loc<br/>
They recognize my face, and so they go<br/>
Gangsta's get respect ya see<br/>
All y'all other niggaz gettin' shook like fleas<br/>
That's on the C<br/>
DPG will never break up<br/>
There's too much motherfuckin' paper to cake up<br/>
That's on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Dogg Pound Gangsta's<br/>
Say it with me<br/>
Say it with me<br/>
Say it with me<br/>
Say it for me<br/>
Right back at ya<br/>
Who go the hook up?<br/>
I do<br/>
I got the hook up<br/>
I got the hook up<br/>
If ya need it<br/>
I got the hook up<br/>
Yeah<br/>
That's gangsta<br/>
Straight up<br/>
98<br/>
Doggy Dogg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X5]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ain't No Limit to this shit<br/>
Ain't No Limit to this shit nigga<br/>
Straight up<br/>
That's gangsta<br/>
And we out
