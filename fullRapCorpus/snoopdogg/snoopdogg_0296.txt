<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Meet me out, can you make it?<br/>
Please don’t make me lie to you, lady<br/>
I’m in it, I’m not in it, but poochie says women<br/>
At the club we finna go, sip some drink and hit some dro<br/>
It’s ok if you don’t go, I’ll make sure to tell you 'bout these pros<br/>
It’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees<br/>
So many pros, it’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees <i>[x3]</i><br/>
So many...<br/>
