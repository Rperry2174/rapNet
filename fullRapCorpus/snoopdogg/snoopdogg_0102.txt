<i>[Intro - Unknown speaker]</i><br/>
How else could you capture the world<br/>
if you don't attack from the back<br/>
To the million march... hehehehe<br/>
(Yo, Snoopa Donna, what??)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When I pull up to the stoplight<br/>
I gotta have a paper right<br/>
If you come back right then we can boog it <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
When I pull up to the stoplight<br/>
I gotta have a paper right<br/>
If you come back right then we can boog it <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Boggy, boggy, boogy...<br/>
I'm going 65, 75, 80<br/>
Mashing down the boulevard downtown movin' like crazy<br/>
In the fastlane, high-beams shining<br/>
Tryna keep the timing on the track<br/>
With the diamond in the back<br/>
Move roof wide open, scoping, locking<br/>
The bitches relieve, the hoes keep hoping<br/>
They can get it, fit in, back seat, just sit in<br/>
Four hoes on a black tryna put their bid in<br/>
Girl, put it to work, you gonna do the damn thing<br/>
Happen, the rest of y'all, eat dirt<br/>
I'm rollin' in the "Mackmobile", I'm back for real<br/>
One hundred percent, pimp-motion, that's the deal<br/>
Back wheel-spinning, number one, I'm winning<br/>
Hoes lookin' inside, and they just to grinning<br/>
Waitin' to choose, while the rest wait to pay y'all dues<br/>
Don't trip I keep my hoes in two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Yeah, this is radio station 187.4 FM on your dial<br/>
In your car up inside the four o'clok traffic jam<br/>
We gonna be taking request right now at 87752-Snoop<br/>
Call station naming ya game...<br/>
Aw, yeah, hello, aw yeah, this Soopafly here<br/>
Man I wanna get a piece of that Stoplight shit<br/>
Man that motherfucking baggin church<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You see them pretty buttons on my stereo? (don't touch 'em)<br/>
Don't touch 'em hoe!<br/>
You see Snoop Dogg on the floor mac<br/>
Pimping ain't (yeah) now sit the fuck back<br/>
I'm the man in charge, +Boss+, my backhand is horse<br/>
Simple slim, man I'm large<br/>
Mashing so big like a fo' by fo'<br/>
Show my do', and if not it's hoe by go<br/>
Ain't a hoe after I can slow my flow<br/>
My wheels cause a fortune, bitch I'm scorching<br/>
Seen some niggas who love to talk shit<br/>
Reach for my thang and my glove compartment<br/>
Dipnap the use it, flashed in my music<br/>
Kids in the streets askin' Doggy how I dooze it<br/>
First place in the race and don't wanna lose it<br/>
Niggas better watch out and bitches better move it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude 2]</i><br/>
Yeah baby, you got ta move your groove<br/>
To prove that you supposed to groove in the moon<br/>
as I recite naughty nothings in yo' eardrums<br/>
If you cruisin' up the boulevard in your car<br/>
Put it in park and let the dogg spark, yeah baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude 3]</i><br/>
Oh, no<br/>
Tot that track you phone<br/>
I am Sam Dussel, DPG Buck<br/>
And I hate Stoplight<br/>
I always make to the next ?McMany?<br/>
I told you right I wouldn't C-Walk<br/>
Light me out, hahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Half past late and I'm still rollin<br/>
Real hoeing, make a nigga pocket still swollin<br/>
Still going, black and white tip-toein'<br/>
Flash in my player's car (why you play so hard?) cause I'm a Don<br/>
Sippin Moet, smoking Chron'<br/>
Doggy wanna see that dress my locks are on<br/>
Pimping black-red, who let bag to blunt<br/>
Can't tell the sunset from the crack of dawn<br/>
Half tank of gas<br/>
Rollin' down the window, reach out to extinct that ass<br/>
Get hot, turn down the heat, burn down the street<br/>
My hoes love to earn my keep<br/>
It's only five miles left, so I whipped it<br/>
Skipped it, lifted it and overdrive<br/>
Straight onto five, pimp nigga on the rise<br/>
85, 95, 100 and good night and fuck that stoplight<br/>
<br/>
