<i>[Excerpt from Paid In Full:]</i><br/>
A nigga like me man, I love the game, I love the hustle man<br/>
I be feeling like one of them ball player niggas you know<br/>
Like Bird, Magic or something<br/>
Yeah you know a nigga got dough a nigga can leave the league<br/>
But if I leave… the fans still gone love me man?<br/>
<br/>
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?<br/>
Came in this game as a kid, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I ain’t do it, people said I did, huh?<br/>
Rap music ain’t what's fuckin' up they kids, huh?<br/>
Gangster rap is fuckin’ up the biz, huh?<br/>
My influence, something that I said, cuh?<br/>
Like I’m jewish, all about the bread, huh<br/>
From the sewage, tryin’ to get ahead, huh<br/>
I’m bout to do it, fuckin’ up they head, huh?<br/>
These opportunist, fuckin’ up they bread, huh?<br/>
Corporate America stance is irregular<br/>
Ready Cuz, rap sheet, impeccable<br/>
Multi plats, my past<br/>
What we have here is unprofessional<br/>
My metal, undetectable, my style, unselectable<br/>
Niggas runnin’ they mouth thats unacceptable<br/>
21st street, Long Beach 'til the death of you<br/>
<br/>
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?<br/>
Came in this game as a kid, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Keep shootin’, thats what the people tell me, huh<br/>
Get the biggest dope sack that you can sell me, huh<br/>
And your homegirl do it, huh<br/>
I make the whole world do it, huh<br/>
Ain’t no limit to the dog and that's real talk<br/>
I’m the one that showed you how a real crip walk<br/>
Resume, document, G-File<br/>
Recollect, reflect, and let me break it down<br/>
Take it out the bag, lay it on the table quick<br/>
Call my handlers, I handle and disable this<br/>
Tickin’ time bomb, made crippin’ look fun<br/>
Can’t walk around without your motherfuckin’ gun, that's a no no<br/>
Real hood redemption, my tiny Lokos is really on a mission<br/>
Niggas runnin’ they mouth thats unacceptable<br/>
21st Street, Long Beach 'til the death of you<br/>
<br/>
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?<br/>
Came in this game as a kid, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Do anybody in the house remember?<br/>
When it wasn’t no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)<br/>
It wasn’t no rappers talking’ bout the LBC (Hell nah)<br/>
So its safe to say, I put it on the map, huh<br/>
So if you see me on the block, yeah, I’m back, huh<br/>
And if you don’t think you know where I’m at, huh<br/>
You wanna battle, little homie, get your racks up<br/>
Boy you need to kit kat, make you niggas get back<br/>
Split you like a kit kat, the big homie did that<br/>
Rollin’ like a rebel though, I’m on a whole ‘nother level though<br/>
My heart, my hair, My G, my seat, that part right there<br/>
I’m more than a rapper though, pure intellectual<br/>
Smooth as a criminal, you hear me though?<br/>
<br/>
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?<br/>
Came in this game as a kid, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?<br/>
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?<br/>
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?
