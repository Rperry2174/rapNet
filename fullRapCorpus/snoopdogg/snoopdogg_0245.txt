<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Smoke the weed, everyday<br/>
Don't smoke the seeds, no way<br/>
Smoke the weed,<br/>
Smoke the weed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Younger generation<br/>
Young boys and girls<br/>
Be careful of the seeds you show<br/>
If you wanna see a strong tree grow<br/>
You gotta put them for the future<br/>
Show respect don't neglect mother nature<br/>
All the pollution in this world<br/>
Me just can't stand it<br/>
Global warming make the whole world panic<br/>
Take care of mother earth 'cause she be the planet<br/>
Youth man don't go astray<br/>
<br/>
Fresh trees, young seeds all tryin' to find the light<br/>
Stretchin' out their limbs to the sun, got them right<br/>
Help them keep their life will trap<br/>
Watch out for life like satellite<br/>
Them winds will stop and go like a traffic light<br/>
Many obstacles to overcome in the city life<br/>
Making sure they stay pure, teach you wrong from right<br/>
See brings more spore new line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Smoke the weed, everyday<br/>
Don't smoke the seeds, no way<br/>
Smoke the weed,<br/>
Smoke the weed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey are you on your own<br/>
16 and with all the money<br/>
When did somewhere to go<br/>
Stick the peer pockets been dallin'<br/>
The baba hurt me break bone<br/>
Holding my fight to herb me can't stop me<br/>
Me solely see Babylon can't come step on it<br/>
Still we read italic critical santanic<br/>
Rude man don't stop chronic, everyday<br/>
<br/>
Roll me the weed oh<br/>
Take off you shot then me mix a couple breed off<br/>
Can't stun the principle go the seed oh<br/>
We no do that if they cheat oh<br/>
And me set herb herb what we all prefer<br/>
And my juggly top street girl<br/>
Honey you done said weed is life<br/>
Weed is reality<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Smoke the weed, everyday<br/>
Don't smoke the seeds, no way<br/>
Smoke the weed,<br/>
Smoke the weed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Early light papa you damn my supper<br/>
Asking my pop off hot like the summer<br/>
You can't never understand why we live the life<br/>
You would never recognize unless you see the fire in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
I'm burying the man like every single day<br/>
Black birds in the sky can't get off break<br/>
The smoke is my gun that's how I blow them away<br/>
Music is my weapon rewind it let it play<br/>
That they line the police sun set all day<br/>
They call me Snoop Lion I smoke everyday<br/>
<br/>
Look granded they see<br/>
Watch them grow a new breed<br/>
Cultivating these streets<br/>
Recycle, care zone<br/>
<br/>
And then we know they know and don't stop<br/>
The tic tac couple universal globe<br/>
The bang bang baby the love stream boomie<br/>
Throw back away procreate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Smoke the weed, everyday<br/>
Don't smoke the seeds, no way<br/>
Smoke the weed,<br/>
Smoke the weed
