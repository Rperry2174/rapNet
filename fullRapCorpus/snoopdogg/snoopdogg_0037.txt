Yea.<br/>
(Don't Let Go)<br/>
Life, life<br/>
(Don't Let Go)<br/>
<br/>
I'm the coldest of the coldest, the dopest of the dopest<br/>
The smoothest of the smoothest and locest of the locest<br/>
The whole world on point for this new joint that I just put together<br/>
So kindly, and you can find on the coast with the most lambs<br/>
High post, plain coast with a bunch thug niggas, drug dealers<br/>
Project fools, C-Murder past dem tools<br/>
Shit I'm bout to make these motherfuckers get up<br/>
I draw the line between yours and mine<br/>
And make sure you dont get lit up<br/>
Hit ha on the motha fickin set when dip<br/>
Dogg pound mutha Fuckin gangsta crew<br/>
Split wigs for a livin everydays thanksgiving<br/>
Mutha fuck yall rides, we slides we dippin<br/>
Nigga the tanks, driven by the colonel Mr. Master P<br/>
Lil Silkky, Mystikal, C and me and Fiend<br/>
Nigga dont be trippin, you got my lil homie in the cut<br/>
That Soulja Slim nigga , he known for dippin<br/>
<br/>
Wassup <br/>
(Don't let go)<br/>
If you love ta bang bang<br/>
And the rap game is just like the dope game<br/>
The minute you forget it, forget it you finished<br/>
Them niggas know when you aint with it<br/>
Thats when they get ignent <br/>
<br/>
(Don't let go)<br/>
Like a twista, like a twista, get twisted with this<br/>
It seems its on, but its off, I keep missin this shit<br/>
I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye<br/>
Lookin dead at the chips, I blink, they dip<br/>
(Don't let go)<br/>
Like a twista like a twista get twisted with this<br/>
It seems its on but its off I keep missing this shit<br/>
I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye<br/>
Lookin dead at the chips, I blink, they dip<br/>
(Don't Let Go)<br/>
It's worth to hang on for life<br/>

Yea<br/>

I'm the hardest of the hardest<br/>
The realest of the realest<br/>
But see I dont fuck nothin but G's ballers and killers<br/>
So pardon my expression G<br/>
If yo bitch is seen wit one of my niggas in the clik<br/>
You best believe she done ate a gangsta dick<br/>
And you cant fault my niggas for dat<br/>
We just a bunch of thug niggas, ex drug dealers <br/>
The kind of gangsta ass niggas that your bitch love niggas<br/>
Don't so that to urself cuz I'm a tell you right now they plug niggas<br/>
They slug niggas<br/>
Now if yo bitch way out of line<br/>
Because when I steppin to Doggy Dogg you better take your time<br/>
Cause out on a limb fuckin with Slim<br/>
And you dont even know that cuz aint nobody told you that<br/>
We need you to show em dat (Don't let go)<br/>
Cuz I'm a pistol strappin car jackin hoe slappin MC<br/>
I dont know why all yall bitches is fuckin with me<br/>
Fuck all my enemies, and chasin cheese with cheese<br/>
Circuit tapes with cd's by the 3's in keys<br/>
Biggie was too large and Tupac was too real<br/>
Niggas had homies with heat on the street and he got killed<br/>
How the fuck did that happen I thought yall niggas was rappin<br/>
Shit but in this real world shit, murder thnags keep crackin<br/>
Besides drive bys and kiddnapping<br/>
Shit when u head up out the door foget the four four<br/>
Never leave home with out it<br/>
Now why dog, niggas everywhere gettin rowdy and bout it<br/>
And don't doubt it, real violence aside and dont forget it<br/>
Its like I said When you ain't with it niggas get ignent<br/>
<br/>
(Don't let go)<br/>
Like a twista, like a twista, get twisted with dis<br/>
It seems its on but its off I keep missing this shit<br/>
I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye<br/>
Lookin dead at the chips, I blink, they dip<br/>

Life life<br/>
