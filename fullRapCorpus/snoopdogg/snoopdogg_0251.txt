<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
When it's over now<br/>
Nothing left for the enemy<br/>
When the show goes down<br/>
And you silence the melody<br/>
(That's when you say)<br/>
I'll be that some boy in Miami<br/>
Rude boy you in the Kingston<br/>
Bad boy in New England<br/>
New York the whole kingdom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
I ain't got the remedy<br/>
But when they root for me<br/>
You see I'm what they see<br/>
I'm living in the sin it's how it's gonna be<br/>
I heard the boy is sinnin and they die for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Wadadadang wadadadadang<br/>
Well you coming on the dance<br/>
And now we shaped up our game<br/>
Wadadadang wadadadadang<br/>
And you know we never ever stop<br/>
Beat them to the end<br/>
See them on top on them<br/>
Willin them, killing them<br/>
And then one after<br/>
See it<br/>
Run to it when nobody asked to be drop off<br/>
When we on my bred Snoop Lion<br/>
Meets his blessing love and honor<br/>
To what we are apart<br/>
And to what we are even<br/>
You know say it all we all prosper<br/>
News flash pick a little ash<br/>
Every website and blog<br/>
Snoop and Busta in the studio<br/>
Hanging out here, get a little bit of snap on<br/>
Don't ever get it twisted<br/>
See we gifted when togheter<br/>
Reincarnated Snoop Lion so let's see out forever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
I ain't got the remedy<br/>
But when they root for me<br/>
You see I'm what they see<br/>
I'm living in the sin it's how it's gonna be<br/>
I heard the boy is sinnin and they die for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Somebody help me wake up<br/>
And make it rain on my head<br/>
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head<br/>
Set it free, so complete, everything has come to ending<br/>
Let it breathe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
When the background clears<br/>
And you're the one standing there<br/>
You're running out of time<br/>
You're praying that you make a hit<br/>
Whatever they do, whatever they do to you<br/>
Whatever they say, whatever they say to you too bad<br/>
Sound off in that Paris<br/>
Roll call in Lebanon<br/>
Many leros in Mexico<br/>
Can you hear me, the whole kingdom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
I ain't got the remedy<br/>
But when they root for me<br/>
You see I'm what they see<br/>
I'm living in the sin it's how it's gonna be<br/>
I heard the boy is sinnin and they die for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Somebody help me wake up<br/>
And make it rain on my head<br/>
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head<br/>
Set it free, so complete, everything has come to ending<br/>
Let it breathe
