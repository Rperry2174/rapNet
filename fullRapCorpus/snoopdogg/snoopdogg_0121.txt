<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Bang out, til the sun comes up <br/>
The wheels fall off in the parking lot<br/>
Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand<br/>
While you posted up, chillin' wit cha mans<br/>
Bang out, won't catch me sleepin<br/>
While you in the club, rollin' out the keys<br/>
Cause I bang out,shots go off quick<br/>
Catch yo' ass buck naked while you wit ya bitch<br/>
Cause I bang out<br/>

<i>[Verse]</i><br/>

I walk up in this bitch with some gold on my neck<br/>
Yeah nigga, I controlling the set, rock and rollin' the bitch<br/>
Then grab a hold of my dick, I pop a hole in ya click<br/>
See you don't wanna fuck with this<br/>
One nigga found on the ground, we don't fuck around<br/>

<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Eastside, Long Beach, rolling twenties<br/>
Yup, we fully wooded,<br/>
Yeah, we wear the black and gold coats<br/>
With patch on the back that says, "Steelers"<br/>
Bang out!<br/>
A lot niggas wanna do us but they can't<br/>
Cause it's hard to get wit us<br/>
Watch out for them sliders, boy we riders<br/>
Heavy hitters, Eastsidaz, yeah (Bang out!)<br/>
We shoot first, talk later<br/>
Nigga, yaw paid her, doggy-dog sprayed her<br/>
Then I slid away, smooth little get-away<br/>
Did it wit a chill of that, (sniff, sniff)<br/>
I gonna need a hit a day<br/>
I live my life like I was John F. Kenne-day<br/>
(Hm, naw) I won't be sent away, fuck a cop, non-stop<br/>
Twenty Crip, all day <br/>

Bang out, won't catch me sleepin<br/>
While you in the club, rollin' out the keys<br/>
Cause I bang out,shots go off quick<br/>
Catch yo' ass buck naked while you wit ya bitch<br/>
Cause I bang out<br/>
