<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Xzibit]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Time to bring your ass to the table y'all<br/>
It's X to the Z, Xzibit<br/>
Snoop double G, uh O.G (Westcoast, Los Angeles)<br/>
Uh, bring it live, Dr. Dre<br/>
What<br/>
Throwin' up a big ass W<br/>
Coverin' up the world, right<br/>
Yeah, listen, look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<i>[Xzibit]</i><br/>
You ain't try to high box with me<br/>
I swing hard liquor<br/>
Goin' down by the second round<br/>
All hail the underground<br/>
How that sound?<br/>
Xzibit backin' down from a conflict<br/>
Fuck the nonsense, terrorist<br/>
Hit a bomb shit<br/>
Blast with metal in every direction<br/>
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson<br/>
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon<br/>
And reason why Niggas promise keep on steppin'<br/>
Xzibit ready to scrap<br/>
Like Mike Tyson with his license back<br/>
9 to 5, minimum wage<br/>
What type of life is that for me<br/>
It not for me<br/>
You fuckin' round with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy<br/>
You outta your destiny<br/>
You don't wanna tango with the X,<br/>
strangle your neck<br/>
slap like the opposite sex<br/>
Drunk drivin' tryin' to stack my loot<br/>
While other rappers gettin' treated like a prostitute<br/>
So check the sound scale<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
All I wanna be was a G, ha<br/>
My poor guide, Nigga please, ha<br/>
Breakin' on these motherfuckin' keys, ha<br/>
Let's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha<br/>
Bet you don't wanna fuck with this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Oh no, big Snoop Dogg<br/>
Back up in the heazy baby<br/>
You jockin' my style<br/>
You so crazy<br/>
Dre said, Ain't No Limit to this<br/>
As long as we drop gangsta shit<br/>
Look here bitch<br/>
You fine and I dig your style<br/>
Come fuck with a Nigga<br/>
Do it Doggystyle<br/>
I'll be gentle, sentimental<br/>
Shit, we fucked in a rental<br/>
Lincoln Continental<br/>
Um, coast to coast<br/>
L.A. to Chicago<br/>
I get this pussy everywhere that I go<br/>
(Yeah Nigga you know what's happenin' man)<br/>
Ask the bitches in your click can't say no<br/>
(These bitches know what time it is)<br/>
I get this pussy everywhere that I go<br/>
(Yeah, oh, a story bout a Nigga like me)<br/>
Ask the bitches in your click can't say no<br/>
(I'm gonna hip these hoes, Nigga)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<i>[Xzibit]</i><br/>
Bitch please<br/>
Get down on your goddamn knees<br/>
For this money, chronic, blow that weed<br/>
You fuckin' with some real O.G's<br/>
Bitch please<br/>
Bitch please<br/>
Get down on your motherfuckin' knees<br/>
We came to get the motherfuckin' G's<br/>
Yeah, you fuckin' with some real O.G's<br/>
You dick-tease<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Bitch please<br/>
Now what you need to do is<br/>
Hand my coat<br/>
And roll me some dope<br/>
Different strokes,<br/>
for different folks<br/>
Oh, you like settin' Niggas up and gettin' them loc's<br/>
Oh, cute little bitch with a whole lot hard<br/>
Shit get thick when the lights get dark<br/>
She said she got some lick for me<br/>
Worked about 200 G's and 30 keys<br/>
Now check this out Dre<br/>
Snap if I don't move<br/>
Then a Nigga like me<br/>
Shit I don't lose<br/>
But you know me<br/>
Dogg I'm movin'<br/>
Ain't nothin' to it, but to get the groovin'<br/>
You've been waitin' on a Nigga like me<br/>
To take your chance and ride with men and beat up the pussy<br/>
A victim off the circumstance<br/>
That's the devil<br/>
They always wanna dance<br/>
See we grow up with a bang<br/>
I'm tryin' to work this cold thing<br/>
And take this whole thing<br/>
I get the money everywhere that I go<br/>
I bust a bitch and take here money for sure<br/>
I get the money everywhere that I go<br/>
I bust a bitch and take here money for sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg x4]</i><br/>
Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo<br/>
You don't wanna step to me<br/>
Still claimin' DPG<br/>
Till the day I D-I-E
