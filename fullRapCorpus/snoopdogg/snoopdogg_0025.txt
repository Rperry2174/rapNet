<i>[Intro/Chorus: Charlie Wilson, Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
She was just a groupie (She just a groupie)<br/>
She was just a groupie<br/>
She was just a groupie (All she wanted was Snoopy)<br/>
She was just a groupie (Just a groupie)<br/>
She was just a groupie<br/>
She was just a groupie (All she wanted just was Snoopy)<br/>
She was just a groupie (Yeah just a groupie)<br/>
She was just a groupie<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Tha Dogg Pound (Dat Nigga Daz, Kurupt)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Beeyatch! (Beeyatch!)<br/>
I come thru with the humps, I thump tha shit out'cha block<br/>
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop<br/>
Spot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch<br/>
??? ever skaty, my team ya's the shit<br/>
Fifteen's humpin, dropped the top, she moaned<br/>
countin my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss<br/>
In South Central I'm on my way to the East Side<br/>
We high, blazin like crazy, we don't know why<br/>
feelin good as fuck on a hot ass day<br/>
and it's a pujam right around the way<br/>
Niggas got hos but ladies in the world<br/>
they wanna play wit their minds like little girls<br/>
I twirled my fingers in the air<br/>
rubbed my fingers thru my hair<br/>
Red bones to black bones<br/>
dark bows to red bows<br/>
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen<br/>
but I play hos like plenty-leany cos I get greedy<br/>
It's all about game cos when the game<br/>
is hard to maintain for so long, man<br/>
From Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma<br/>
Tonight *?warnin the award is?* from Mississippi, I know ya<br/>
hold the key to unlock the door<br/>
From long clothes she rolls with gold thangs we ridin for sure<br/>
So tell me how much money can one playa make? (make)<br/>
and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?<br/>
You're just a gigolo (you know)<br/>
To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)<br/>
<br/>
I was off in Vallejo<br/>
pullin hos like Idaho potatoes<br/>
What am I to do when life as a G<br/>
bein from where I be, DPG<br/>
It's manifico<br/>
ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico<br/>
mixed with a sprinkle of black<br/>
So I'ma approach her like dat<br/>
and let her know where I ride and reside at<br/>
My zone the place that I call home<br/>
is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room<br/>
Picture me ay<br/>
entrepenuer with my nigga D-A<br/>
Rockin tours and we still young boys<br/>
They got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas<br/>
She used ta put em on his bomb ass dick<br/>
She always talked some bomb ass shit<br/>
She used to blow some bomb ass dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's right<br/>
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?<br/>
Someone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G<br/>
Hey girl, what's your name? Ya wanna go a couple rounds with me<br/>
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Warren G, Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
What's up baby, my name is Warren<br/>
I'm down with the Pound<br/>
cos I get around<br/>
So let me scoop you, swoop you and take you<br/>
Gimme a chance and I'ma break you<br/>
down to the very last compound<br/>
with my homies from Tha Dogg Pound<br/>
<br/>
Now you know and I know<br/>
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho<br/>
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast<br/>
The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash<br/>
You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos<br/>
I bust a brand new ho in every video<br/>
That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow<br/>
I pass a ho to my kinfolk<br/>
and then smoke<br/>
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy<br/>
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me<br/>
Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi<br/>
then turn on some Snoopy and, uhh, heat up jacuzzi<br/>
and later on I might just turn on a movie<br/>
so you can regroupie and redo me just for Snoopy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus to fade]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Warren G]</i><br/>
<br/>
There's roaches and shit in this motherfucker in here<br/>
I forgot about this
