<i>[Chorus: Mr. Kane]</i><br/>
In the world of change, here I am<br/>
Tryin to have some thangs<br/>
So what you need is some game, to get your money man<br/>
Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Thinkin of a master plan<br/>
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand<br/>
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent<br/>
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint<br/>
So I, start my mission, leave my residence<br/>
Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents<br/>
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid<br/>
So I think of all the devious things I did<br/>
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny<br/>
Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money<br/>
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous<br/>
I feel great, so maybe I might just<br/>
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive<br/>
Then maybe I'll stay alive<br/>
So I walk up the street, whistlin this<br/>
Feelin out of place cause man do I miss<br/>
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of<br/>
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of<br/>
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang<br/>
But without no money man that shit's a dream<br/>
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid<br/>
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made<br/>
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull<br/>
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full <i>[echoes]</i><br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[beat from the remix of "Paid in Full" plays in the background]</i><br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Money, money, money, money!<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Money, money, money, money!<br/>
