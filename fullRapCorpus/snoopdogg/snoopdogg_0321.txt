<i>[Snoop Dogg &amp; October London:]</i><br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
The revolution will be televised<br/>
The revolution<br/>
Just Blaze<br/>
Oh-oh-oh-oh<br/>
This is serious business<br/>
Dududududu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[October London:]</i><br/>
The revolution, oh, oh<br/>
(Yes)<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>
(The revolution will be televised)<br/>
The revolution, oh, oh<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Sitting back watching, but I'm so unstable<br/>
I been an OG since I was rockin' in the cradle<br/>
Y'all don't know that my bite is so fatal<br/>
Kick a fool down like the homie with the 80-<br/>
Ayy though, nigga don't play though<br/>
With the <i>[?]</i> like the spray though<br/>
Sculpted left hand full of clay dough<br/>
Split him in the middle cut him up like a potato<br/>
Oh, leave 'em on the sideline, bleeding cause he tried mine<br/>
We loot 'til the boot out<br/>
Me and my brother, we was caught up in a shootout<br/>
Had to handle, pigs on a nigga, four days<br/>
Eight laws of power, eighty-five ways<br/>
TEC-9's with a couple 45's<br/>
And the revolution will be televised<br/>
<br/>
<i>[October London:]</i><br/>
The revolution, oh, oh<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>
(The revolution will be televised)<br/>
The revolution, oh, oh<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>
(The revolution will be televised)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
This ain't he local pass cash with the bra fast views<br/>
This shit will be viewed on your broadcast news<br/>
Why did I do it? My momma is on the call<br/>
Shot three lil pigs and now my back against the wall<br/>
Nowhere to turn and no where to go<br/>
My blood is burnin' I'm about to blow<br/>
Huey, Malcolm and Martin, those are my peers<br/>
They been doin' niggas like this for over hundreds of years<br/>
Poppin' us, fear, now it's time for us to clap back<br/>
But this time we gon' bust them the fuck back<br/>
We ain't runnin', we shootin' and lookin' forward<br/>
Anybody, somebody, everybody on the floor<br/>
They just surrounded my place<br/>
Hold the court in the streets so I can win my case<br/>
TEC-9's with a couple 45's<br/>
And the revolution will be televised<br/>
<br/>
<i>[October London:]</i><br/>
The revolution, oh, oh<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>
(The revolution will be televised)<br/>
The revolution, oh, oh<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>
(The revolution will be televised)<br/>
<br/>
The revolution-lution-lution-lution<br/>
The revolution-lution-lution-lution<br/>
Will be televised<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
The revolution-lution-lution-lution<br/>
Oh, la-la-la-la-da-da-da<br/>
<br/>
The revolution, oh, oh<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>
(The revolution will be televised)<br/>
The revolution, oh, oh, na, na, na, na, na<br/>
Will be televised, will be televised<br/>
(The revolution will be televised)
