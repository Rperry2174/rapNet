Ima tell you what's more gangster than anything<br/>
Keep your family straight, and watch <i>[?]</i> continue to grow<br/>
(This is Serious business)<br/>
For the generation after you<br/>
(official business)<br/>
And beyond<br/>
Now that's gangster<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Break up to make up, wake up to cake up<br/>
And spanky-danky with me, we gon' bake up<br/>
Null and void, modest toys<br/>
I'm proud to present to y'all the Broadus Boyz<br/>
And we gon' ball 'til the day we ball<br/>
Ball 'til the day we ball<br/>
We gon' ball 'til the day we ball<br/>
We gon' ball 'til the day we ball<br/>
<br/>
Top Dogg - Basset Hound<br/>
A dream of mines is to pass it down<br/>
To my two boys, cause I remember back<br/>
When they used to roll with me, sittin' on my lap<br/>
Doin' photo shoots for Jet magazine<br/>
Shout-out to the boss lady, yeah, that's my queen<br/>
What a team, it's all in fun<br/>
Now the story be Cory B, no guns<br/>
Point blank, yeah we gettin' bank<br/>
We on Instagram, takin' pictures with my fam<br/>
Superfly<br/>
Now everybody and they mama tryna get that application Snoopified<br/>
So they can float with us, and go with us and roll with us<br/>
But we ain't really trippin', that's what's wrong us<br/>
And how they get along with us<br/>
Got the whole world tryna do a song with us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
We ballin', we swishin' and goin' on missions<br/>
Headed to the right position, like the top, like where them blimps is<br/>
Got a lot of ambition, zoomin', changin' transmission<br/>
Got 'em lookin', like "who is this?"<br/>
It's them Broadus Boyz, boy, we makin' noise<br/>
Sit back, listen and enjoy<br/>
Champions repeating<br/>
Y'all not winning money Ten, we undefeated<br/>
Million-dollar business Menace rippin'<br/>
Cali livin' on the beach with palm trees<br/>
A hundred deep, lookin' like an army<br/>
We feelin' the breeze, the ballin' nothin' to me<br/>
Been doin' this since a youngin<br/>
You shootin' lay-ups, we dunkin'<br/>
7-calorie bumpin', keep it live and keep it jumpin'<br/>
In the junction pop-poppin' with the youngins<br/>
We keep it 100, he on top of his money<br/>
Ballin' 'til we ball, Summer to Fall, we hotter than all<br/>
On the loose, we the truth in the booth, dippin' in the Coupes<br/>
<i>[?]</i> Pops and Lil' Snupe<br/>
We've got the juice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Me and my brother loop on<br/>
We don't fuck with them coupons<br/>
We dip OG in fruit punch we don't care where you from<br/>
Come from where niggas do bring guns<br/>
But the only gun I got is my doobie<br/>
My life is on tour so my life is a movie<br/>
Goin' to shows, tryna roll, doing everything, weary<br/>
Though she gotta be wishin' that she could fuck with this pimpin' (Hol Up)<br/>
Cause it was taught, not given<br/>
Y'all life is bought, not livin'<br/>
And maybe that's what's the difference, I'm still in the kitchen<br/>
Cause cops still in my business, throwin' rocks at my bitches<br/>
Dog, I'm livin' the livin', dog<br/>
I'm just livin' the livin'<br/>
So the cops in my business<br/>
The bitch got different feelings<br/>
It's that lane switchin', doobie twistin' young brother 'bout his business<br/>
<br/>
