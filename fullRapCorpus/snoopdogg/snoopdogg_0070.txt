I LOVE MY MOMMA..<br/>
Through all the drama..<br/>

I love my momma<br/>
Check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[singer]</i><br/>
The first one to hold me (yeah)<br/>
The first one to scold me (yes-o)<br/>
You never cease to teach me<br/>
And always try to reach me (momma..)<br/>
Took me to school the first day<br/>
Taught me how to kneel, down and pray (amen)<br/>
You learned me how to count from one to ten<br/>
And never forget, where I've been<br/>
Momma.. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Yeah, I love my momma<br/>
Through all the drama, I love my momma (I love my momma)<br/>
Through all the drama, I love my momma<br/>
Yeah, I love my momma -- love you momma (momma!)<br/>
I love my momma<br/>
Through all the drama, yeah I love my momma<br/>
I love you mom (momma!)<br/>
I love my momma<br/>
Through all the drama, yeah I love my momma<br/>
I love you momma (I love you momma)<br/>
Yeah, I love you momma, yeah, I love you momma<br/>
(listen here) Trip..<br/>

<i>[singer]</i><br/>
You taught me how to care (uhh)<br/>
You taught me how to share (f'real)<br/>
You taught me how to love and to give<br/>
thanks to the one above -- I love you momma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Yeah, I love my momma<br/>
I love you momma, I love my momma -- I love you momma<br/>
I love you momma (I love you momma)<br/>
I love my momma (I love you momma)<br/>
I love my momma (now you tell em Snoop)<br/>
<br/>
You taught me how to read and write, how to fight<br/>
My do's and dont's, my wills and my wont's<br/>
I'll never forget, the things that we went through<br/>
Bangin oldies in the livin room, sippin brew<br/>
Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then<br/>
My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend<br/>
Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end<br/>
And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends<br/>
Time and time again, I'ma spit this rhyme again<br/>
She the queen in my life, and I'ma make sure she gon' shine again<br/>
She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee<br/>
She taught me everythang, except how to see a G<br/>
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me<br/>
instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound<br/>
I made you cry, you made me smile<br/>
I just wanna say I love you for life<br/>
and that's the reason why I'm here now<br/>
Love, Snoop<br/>
<br/>
I love my momma, yeah..<br/>
I love my momma (I love you momma)<br/>
Yeah, I love my momma (I love you momma)<br/>
Through all the drama, yeah, yo, yeah, I love you (I love you)<br/>
Momma, momma, momma, momma, I love my momma<br/>
Momma, I love you momma<br/>
I love you momma<br/>
Momma, momma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[singer]</i><br/>
Your money wasn't always long (fo' sho')<br/>
But your heart was forever strong (momma.. momma..)<br/>
You taught me bout faith and hope<br/>
And never ever get hooked on dope<br/>
Momma.. (I love you, I love you momma)<br/>
I love you momma.. (throught all the drama, I love my momma)<br/>
<br/>
