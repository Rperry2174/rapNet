<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Poppin, stoppin, hoppin like a rabbit<br/>
When I take the nina Ross ya know I gota ta have it<br/>
I lay back in the cut retain myself<br/>
Think about the shit, and I'm thinkin wealth<br/>
How can I makes my grip<br/>
And how should I make that nigga straight slip<br/>
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip<br/>
as i dip around the corner, now i'm on a-nother<br/>
mission, wishin, upon a star<br/>
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar<br/>
In the back of the limo no demo, this is the real<br/>
Breakin niggaz down like Evander Holyfield, chill<br/>
to the next Episode<br/>
I make money, and I really don't love hoes<br/>
Tell ya the truth, I swoop in the Coupe<br/>
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops<br/>
But now I, make, hits, every single day<br/>
With, that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre<br/>
So lay back in the cut, motherfucker 'fore you get shot<br/>
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin cop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Boy it's gettin hot, yes indeed it is<br/>
Snoop Dogg on the mic i'm about as crazy as Biz<br/>
Markie, spark the, chronic bud real quick<br/>
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit<br/>
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut<br/>
Niggaz try to play the D-O-G like a mutt<br/>
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop <br/>
I'm fin to fuck a bitch, what's her name it's Luke<br/>
You tried to see me, on the TV, youse a B.G.<br/>
D-O-double-G, yes I'ma O.G.<br/>
You can't see my homey Dr. Dre<br/>
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say<br/>
Gotta take a trip to the MIA <br/>
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin AK<br/>
You, can't, see, the D-O-double-G, cuz that be me<br/>
i'm servin um, swervin in the Coupe<br/>
The Lexus, flexes, from Long Beach to Texas<br/>
Sexist, hoes, they wanna get witht his<br/>
Cuz Snoop Dogg is the shit, beeeitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ahhhh, I'm somewhat brain boggled<br/>
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble<br/>
Grab it, have it, stick it to the plug<br/>
It's Snoop, Doggy, I got a got a fat dub<br/>
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc<br/>
Need myself a lighter so I can't take a smoke<br/>
I toke everyday, I loc everyday<br/>
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre<br/>
Lay back in the cut, like I told your ass<br/>
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast<br/>
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz<br/>
And bitches who fuck him, gimme the ass<br/>
Cuz they know about the shit that we be goin through<br/>
And they know about the shit that I be puttin up<br/>
And they be knowin bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic<br/>
Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon<br/>
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay<br/>
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being seein<br/>
No I'm not European bein all I can<br/>
When I put the motherfuckin mic in my hand, and <br/>
You don't understand when i'm kickin<br/>
Cuz Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me<br/>
Listen to me, cuz I do you like you wanna be done<br/>
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm<br/>
Dum, diddy-dum here I come<br/>
With the gat and the guitar was strung, I'm<br/>
not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was<br/>
When I caught you slippin, I'm gon catch you then I peel your cap<br/>
Snapped back, relax<br/>
Ya better not be slippin with them deez on the '83 Cadillac<br/>
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this<br/>
G's up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
