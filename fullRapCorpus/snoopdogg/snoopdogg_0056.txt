<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song<br/>
(she was in love)<br/>
A gangsta love song, you feel me?  Check it out<br/>
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)<br/>
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!<br/>
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty<br/>
Black female with chips, from the city?<br/>
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends<br/>
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends<br/>
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)<br/>
When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys<br/>
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)<br/>
Cause everytime she came to pick a nigga up<br/>
Shit, she'd take a nigga out<br/>
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look<br/>
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low<br/>
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together<br/>
Man I hope this thang last forever<br/>
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet<br/>
She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit<br/>
And don't say shit when I dip with my click<br/>
And understand, when I'm down and out<br/>
may need some help with some chips<br/>
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't<br/>
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk<br/>
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world<br/>
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls<br/>
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me<br/>
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie<br/>
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug<br/>
In love with a thug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)<br/>
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta<br/>
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)<br/>
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Mm.. I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do<br/>
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew<br/>
That I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo<br/>
But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too<br/>
Whatchu gon' do?  "You know I'm gon' stay true<br/>
But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to"<br/>
Well um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind<br/>
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time<br/>
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short<br/>
On another phoneline, holla'n at my other hoe<br/>
This bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT<br/>
Old fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH<br/>
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap<br/>
Niggaz watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)<br/>
Never caught slippin, always on strap<br/>
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin getback<br/>
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby<br/>
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy<br/>
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college<br/>
She gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge<br/>
Cause gangsta-ass niggaz go to school nowadays<br/>
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways<br/>
She fell in love with the local G<br/>
And now they both in the penetentiary, she didn't mention me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
