Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky<br/>
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999<br/>
Shit out of control, sign of the times<br/>
I ain't had this much fun since '79<br/>
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn<br/>
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing<br/>
Playin football up in Powly High<br/>
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside<br/>
Homocides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much<br/>
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up<br/>
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end<br/>
So next year we can do it all again<br/>
Same dogg channel, same dogg time<br/>
Only the strong will survive in 99<br/>
So much drama and dillusion, my conclusion is confusing<br/>
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music<br/>
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it<br/>
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it<br/>
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising<br/>
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)<br/>
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)<br/>
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine<br/>
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime<br/>
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime<br/>
Be smart, fresh start is all you need<br/>
First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed<br/>
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating<br/>
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating<br/>
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say<br/>
But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead<br/>
And Betty said Eddie's a fed<br/>
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head<br/>
And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance<br/>
Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share<br/>
But look at how you livin for a minute then compare<br/>
I love confetti, I always stay ready<br/>
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli<br/>
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now<br/>
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow<br/>
Two down, with just one gun<br/>
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun<br/>
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone<br/>
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone<br/>
Tragically casulties and fatalities<br/>
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me<br/>
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said<br/>
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead<br/>
I never really understood what he said<br/>
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head<br/>
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson<br/>
Slow down and go down, shit you know now<br/>
<br/>
Be smart, fresh start is all you need<br/>
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed<br/>
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating<br/>
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating<br/>
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say<br/>
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way<br/>
<br/>
(Somehow someway)<br/>
You got to make a better way<br/>
(You got to make a better way)<br/>
You got to make a better way<br/>
(You got to make a better way)<br/>
You got to make a better way<br/>
(You got to make a better way)<br/>
You got to make a better way<br/>
(Yeah, better days ahead)<br/>
Better days ahead<br/>
(Better days ahead)<br/>
Better days ahead<br/>
<br/>
That's real.<br/>
I feel your pain nigga.<br/>
I used to be just like you nigga.<br/>
Before I got off in this rap shit.<br/>
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar.<br/>
You know, but one thing I never did do.<br/>
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing.<br/>
I went out and got my own ya feel me?<br/>
So from me to you, man to man.<br/>
Better days ahead my nigga.<br/>
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on.<br/>
Cause I'm a get mine regardless.<br/>
Nigga wether I'm rapping or on the streets.<br/>
I gotta have it.
