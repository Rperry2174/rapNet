Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo Quik check this out dog<br/>
You know mothafuckers be doin way way too mothafuckin much<br/>
You know? That's real<br/>
Just like baby right here, she doin too much<br/>
<br/>
Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car<br/>
And he actin like it's his but you know it's not<br/>
Say he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much<br/>
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up<br/>
She actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up<br/>
Say she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much<br/>
<br/>
I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb<br/>
I told em "Hit the side and slide and get the herb"<br/>
But guess who's callin, Pipedream Patty<br/>
Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley<br/>
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)<br/>
Fuck that nigga yo <br/>
But I can't forget about him cuz he taught me everything I know<br/>
Oh no Joe, walkin down the wrong lane<br/>
Tootin on that cocaine, fuckin wit that wrong thang<br/>
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)<br/>
Then fake the funk, doggonnit<br/>
Now loc, look at this predicament<br/>
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit <br/>
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew<br/>
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to<br/>
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew<br/>
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce<br/>
<br/>
Now if you're doin for your family and you can't stand it<br/>
Cuz you know these mothafuckers tryin take advantage<br/>
Say they doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much<br/>
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope<br/>
And he need to catch a mothafuckin different stroke<br/>
Say he doin too much, yeah Joey you doin too much<br/>
<br/>
We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style<br/>
We might throw a pool party every once in a while<br/>
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend<br/>
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in<br/>
I believe in, sharin the cock<br/>
Also, I believe in comparin the cock<br/>
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)<br/>
Cuz she love the way I just beat up the pussy<br/>
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep<br/>
When she went down on me<br/>
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off<br/>
Ooh wee, baby you's a freak<br/>
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta<br/>
But my homey fell in love and he banked her<br/>
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist<br/>
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist<br/>
<br/>
Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back<br/>
And he get his third strike wit no get back<br/>
Say he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much<br/>
And when the homey in the pen, doin a sin<br/>
And his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend<br/>
Say she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much<br/>
<br/>
I'm livin up in the hills, wine sippin wit mills<br/>
I'm havin major type of paper, I ain't trippin off bills (still)<br/>
Show me some respect and accept my coolness<br/>
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish<br/>
Use this as a warning, cuz I'm startin<br/>
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin<br/>
Pardon me, cuz I ain't mad when you get bent<br/>
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?<br/>
Friends and family, gettin after me like repo<br/>
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note<br/>
You doin too much when you clutchin on my touch-tone<br/>
Callin strays over nigga leadin months gone<br/>
Conversate for fo' hours, wastin mo' power<br/>
And only get to hit a cold shower<br/>
You fakin like you're makin more moves than Simpson<br/>
But frontin, pushin buttons, doin nuttin but sin<br/>
<br/>
And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin up yo' bill<br/>
Tryin to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel<br/>
You know he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much<br/>
And when your baby momma cryin bout she need some milk<br/>
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt<br/>
You know she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much<br/>
That's real
