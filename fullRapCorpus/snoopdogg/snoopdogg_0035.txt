Ahh-haaa<br/>
Get your motherfuckin' glass, cus it's a blast from the past<br/>
You didn't think would touch it two times nigga<br/>
Gin and Juice up in this bitch, yahhh<br/>
Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor, you feel me (you heard me)<br/>
Get your ice, get your cups, Cus we about to get fucked up in here<br/>
Yah (yah), Straight up, Uhmm (uhmm), Yah (yah)<br/>
<br/>
I'm still smokin', driftin', swifta than a mothafucka<br/>
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice<br/>
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank<br/>
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank<br/>
Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause<br/>
Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws<br/>
Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga<br/>
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' nigga<br/>
To fucked up off that G-I and juice,<br/>
C-I get loose, nigga what chall wanna do<br/>
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo<br/>
Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low-low<br/>
Convertable top, spot for the glock, I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg<br/>
So toss out the soda pop.<br/>
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills<br/>
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Rollin down the street, with heat<br/>
Drankin', ???, Sittin' on D's<br/>
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze<br/>
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now trip dis', I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin' with this Creole<br/>
She said she knows NINO, now stop me loc<br/>
Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out<br/>
Then turn the bitch out, look here<br/>
There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time<br/>
See I picked you up, now I'm gunna stick you up, And dick you up!<br/>
Give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality<br/>
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first<br/>
And then it got worse, cus now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt<br/>
Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway<br/>
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way<br/>
Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain<br/>
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain<br/>
Now it ain't no thing, cus she swallowed it up<br/>
Then she wanted to take a puff, I said "Look here bitch you've had<br/>
enough"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up<br/>
(Say What, Say What)<br/>
Come on, Now<br/>
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up<br/>
(What Chew Say, What Chew Say) YAH<br/>
<br/>
I'm hopped by the ice cream shop, The cops saw me, stopped me, heard me<br/>
Were's Serv-D, well serve me, since you got that big bad ass dangle<br/>
Nigga you know I'm know for havin' that big ass bank<br/>
Tryin' to find all your dope, cus your a smoker<br/>
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast<br/>
Cus times gettin' hard on the boulevard, but I refuse to loose ?!?!?!<br/>
Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something<br/>
Got Some (Got Some), I know you got some<br/>
Nigga stop frontin', get at your boy<br/>
Hook it up like Master P (Ughh)<br/>
Would it be a tragedy to fill me the best weed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
