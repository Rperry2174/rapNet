<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander<br/>
undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")<br/>
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Hmm, and I ain't never felt like this<br/>
I ain't never met a girl with the right mix<br/>
Green eyes, light-skinned with some nice tits<br/>
It took a minute just to write this<br/>
I'm the Boss Dogg baby! I'ma die rich<br/>
So let the money talk for me, fuck the nonsense<br/>
Hold me down, be my ride or die bitch<br/>
We fuck then we fight, we fight then we fuck<br/>
I'ma beat it up tonight like Kimbo Slice<br/>
Come live the proper life, no I ain't the shoppin type<br/>
I might take you out to eat, we can grab a bite<br/>
Now let me grab my bike and roll yo' ass through Crescent Heights<br/>
Up in Hollywood, step into the limelight<br/>
and hit this bubble kush, let me get your mind right<br/>
This is "Wonderland," let your mind take flight<br/>
We gotta hurry up, I'm only here for one night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
This next girl Bird, she from the suburbs<br/>
and live by herself, like cars and nice furs<br/>
and loves hip-hop - The Neptunes and Murs<br/>
But I'm her favorite rapper, my biggest fan is her<br/>
I like her skin tone, and how her figure curves<br/>
We smoke mad kush and drink until our vision blur<br/>
And then I pat her down, like she gettin searched<br/>
I fuck her with my chain on, she pulls on my shirt<br/>
like nigga don't stop, until the pussy squirt<br/>
I hit it twice and bone out, she went back to work<br/>
This happens all the time, I gotta go rehearse<br/>
for my next show, I tour on May 1st<br/>
Get yo' mind right, and this may work<br/>
You know love is pain, and havin faith hurts<br/>
You rollin with the best, so grab your heels and purse<br/>
and welcome to "Wonderland" the best place on Earth<br/>
Uhh, you gon' love me!<br/>
<br/>
("And ohh you're gonna love me")<br/>
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 1/2]</i>
