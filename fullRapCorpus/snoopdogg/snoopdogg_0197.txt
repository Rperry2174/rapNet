Dogghouse<br/>
Gimme some of that g shit goldie loc<br/>
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin 'bout<br/>
Yeah, check this out y'all, uh huh huh<br/>
<br/>
We got Snoop Dogg in the house tonight, with the homeboy tray-deee<br/>
Waniac, trip loc and goldie, 4 tay from the bay, what you say<br/>
What you say, huh? (we do this like everyday)<br/>
<br/>
Did ya get the dank, did ya get the dank?<br/>
Yeah I got the dank, you got the gas in the tank?<br/>
V.I.p. status, don't need an apparatus<br/>
'cause the niggas I fuck with, they all about the cabbage<br/>
Down in yellobrick road my destination, the dogghouse<br/>
Toastin remys, fillin' jimmies, we goin all out<br/>
Lookin for the wizard, creepin through the fog<br/>
Got some bad ass bitches, headed to the player's ball<br/>
They gon be strippin and wigglin ass<br/>
Hope you brought your playa pass<br/>
Tray-deee, goldie half dead, the twins blaze sacks<br/>
Bigger than big everyday in l.a.<br/>
4 tay representin for the whole damn yae, beeyotch<br/>
<br/>
Dogghouse, turnin it out, and if you ain't dope you gots to get<br/>
The fuck out, that's on the o g d p, (say what)<br/>
And that's how it is when you fuckin with me<br/>
<br/>
Don't matter how you come, use all angles<br/>
Ties become tangled when the cutthroat strangles<br/>
My hookup, long rangers<br/>
Better float like a nationwide sky pager<br/>
Them hoes save us, talk about bein playas<br/>
On the real we can deal with you playa haters<br/>
We hit the spot, every city got a block<br/>
What you makin when you take it to a different type of level that it pops<br/>
Know the dogg keep the hip rocks, steady bangin<br/>
Hoes steady sangin from the gang that we claimin<br/>
Yo, it's waniac, the maniac, trip loc won't you spit that rap<br/>
<br/>
Park my shit and jump out, I'm at the homies spot<br/>
To see if he floatin with me up to the dogghouse<br/>
Hit the weed he lightin, outside little niggas is fightin<br/>
This bomb, I'm likin<br/>
Holla at my folks I know up in the complex<br/>
Nigga ready to ride as soon as he get dressed<br/>
Now we ready to roll, hit the store, then the carpool lane<br/>
Once again it's on, big chiefin<br/>
Remind me of the noisiest place<br/>
Ladies all over the place, and niggas super laced<br/>
How we like it, saggin in my 5 0 1<br/>
Killin my lungs, keepin these homies and bitches on one<br/>
<br/>
Man I got warrants, bad tax, still sayin fuck it<br/>
Headed up to dogghouse swervin in a bucket<br/>
Puffin on some bomb from my comrade blue<br/>
And got my little bitch catch a contact too<br/>
House shoes with the blue khaki suit and my locs on<br/>
Swoopin to some soopafly, gettin my smoke on<br/>
Nigga goldie loc got the heat on roast it<br/>
4 tay on the way plus the twins is posted<br/>
Bout to set it off bet it's off the hook<br/>
Straight crooks, gettin money off the books<br/>
Makin nothin but that gangsta shit that niggas lovin<br/>
Thuggin at the house party, fuck goin clubbin<br/>
<br/>
Let me hear you say pimps, banks, hustlers<br/>
Let's all get the money then murder these motherfuckers<br/>
Cocksuckers, they can't stop us<br/>
Now put up your choppers, just in case they rollin with them coppers<br/>
I shut em down, doggpound for them bitches<br/>
I be seein you with snitches everytime I'm hittin switches<br/>
Ice skatin over dicthes<br/>
I'm true to the game, plus I'm out to get them riches<br/>
I be mobbin down the road tryin to bag up my bags<br/>
I'm saggin so hard I'm tearin up the back of my khakis<br/>
I'm tryin to reach my dogg dirty red<br/>
But this hoe won't let me know, which way to go<br/>
I'm movin slow<br/>
My chucks only come with a hundred miles of walkin<br/>
Hundred miles of runnin smellin funny and I'm gunnin nigga<br/>
Doggpound gangsta crip for life<br/>
And we gon party in this motherfucker all damn night
