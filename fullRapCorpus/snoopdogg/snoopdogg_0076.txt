<i>[MC Ren]</i><br/>
Here come The Villain again, grab your hoe and get the fuck outta town<br/>
This nigga shit make the world go round<br/>
It's that black nigga Ren, duck when I bust<br/>
Make Jada get on these nuts, make Will, love to cuss<br/>
You wanna fuck with us? Man, I wouldn't do it<br/>
Ask this nigga here, his ass, we ran right through it<br/>
You out actin like yo' shit be tight<br/>
Get some shit, fuck it off like Tamika Wright<br/>
Get the fuck out my site, I Ren-incarnate<br/>
Droppin West coast shit in every motherfuckin state<br/>
Motherfuckin legend, y'all niggaz be knowin<br/>
You can leave yo' bitch and keep on goin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I am Doggy Dogg bitch (beitch) love to hit a switch<br/>
Never hit a bitch (beitch) love that gangsta shit<br/>
Can I hear your flow? Can I fuck yo' hoe?<br/>
Boy you hard on 'em - nigga you ain't know?<br/>
When you testify, you got to keep it fly<br/>
A lot of niggaz lie, shit we do or die<br/>
E'ryday we high, it's like a nine to five<br/>
I got my nina my fo'-heata beata by my side<br/>
I keep it tucked close when I'm on the West coast (West coast)<br/>
I keep it on post when I'm with my East coast folks locs (East coast)<br/>
Y'all know what's crack-a-lackin<br/>
I'm from the hood of the drivebys and kidnappings, and car-jackings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ice Cube]</i><br/>
Me and Snoop Dogg on the hog<br/>
On our way to the mall, fuck alla y'all<br/>
We gon' ball til we fall, watch the chrome crawl<br/>
Intercept these fine bitches cause we want 'em all<br/>
Droppin drawers, poppin coochie and lickin balls<br/>
Only gangsta ass nigga follow nigga laws<br/>
Only gangsta ass bitches get to run the hogs<br/>
Only real ass niggaz get to set it off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Lady of Rage]</i><br/>
Now, the way I gets off in that ass it's a sin to not assassin<br/>
Grab a microphone have flashbacks and start flashin, ahh<br/>
I'm bound to toast ya<br/>
String you up like you was on the Ponderosa<br/>
Sip on Mimosa do it that way cause I'm supposed ta<br/>
Now most of ya, don't measure up<br/>
I'll make it hot and turn the pressure up<br/>
Steamin, regular, nah supreme and I ain't gassed<br/>
I blow an MC away like Fox(?) when I pass<br/>
Ain't nuttin shitty about this here fuck around and that's that ass<br/>
Just like, grass I, I want more Green than the Goblin<br/>
Matter of fact I want more Bank than that chick that be modelin (UHH!)<br/>
My uzi weighs more than a single ton<br/>
I leave you single son, who wanna mingle not a single one<br/>
Hah, now tell me what you figure, nigga<br/>
Rob load up the show slow flow spitter<br/>
The hard hitter (UHH) the R nigga, roll<br/>
I break it down sweet then I bring it back slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Nigga that was dumb diggy diggy dumb dumb<br/>
Here them niggaz come kiddy kiddy come come<br/>
I think a nigga sprung spriggy spriggy sprung sprung<br/>
Probably why he done diggy diggy done done<br/>
Yo' lady think I'm cute, I be knockin her boots<br/>
When she's away from home, she be swallowin juice<br/>
You thinkin that's yo' son, but he ain't lookin like you<br/>
See the barrel of a gun, nigga whatcha gon' do?<br/>
Set it off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Niggaz pop mo' shit while we drop mo' shit<br/>
Continously, nigga nigga please<br/>
Slang yo' ki's, birdies and trees<br/>
You can catch me and my niggaz, overseas<br/>
Shootin the breeze, with a cute Vietnamese<br/>
or was she Lebonese? I think she Chinese<br/>
It really don't matter cause they all on they knees<br/>
It's somethin bout these motherfuckin West coast G's<br/>
Make that cheese, when the cops come you bet' not freeze<br/>
Blast on 'em like the Genovese, they yo' enemies<br/>
Lock you up and fuck you up<br/>
Talk shit to you beat you down then cuff you up<br/>
and leave you in a cell stuffed (damn!)<br/>
I ain't got no money for bail, that's real as fuck (f'real)<br/>
Tryin to get a meal ticket and kick it<br/>
Chill, catch a plane to Spain or maybe Brazil<br/>
on the real can you feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland ad libs for a bit]</i><br/>

<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
