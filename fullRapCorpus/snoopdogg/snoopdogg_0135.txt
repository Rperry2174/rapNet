<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah man, this is another 9 inch dick classic<br/>
We wanna dedicate this one, to all the fellas<br/>
who got a hardhead bitch, who just won't listen<br/>
Y'know?  The best thing to do, is leave her<br/>
Don't hit her, shake that ho (bitch I'm gone!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Soopafly]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm gone.. I can't take it no mo'<br/>
I can't get through to you<br/>
There's nothin I can say that you seem to understand<br/>
Bitch I'm gonnnnnnnnneeeeeee.. I'm out oh yeah yeah yeah<br/>
I'm through wit'chu<br/>
Oh I'm through wit'chu, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
I knew that you, was a ho back then<br/>
And bitch you're still one now<br/>
Ya like to bust, nuts in your face<br/>
But with that big-ass mouth<br/>
you need to shut the fuck up, you talk too much<br/>
I told you once before, yeah<br/>
That pimpin don't, like to tell you twice<br/>
So I'm walkin out that dooooooooooor<br/>

<i>[Chorus: Soopafly]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm gone.. oh yeah bitch I'm, oh I, I got to get the, hell outta here<br/>

Oh yeah, I'm through wit'chu bitch, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
(Bitch I'm gone) Bitch I'm through wit'chu<br/>
I'm through wit'chu, cause I refuse to lose<br/>
I can't be locked in your world<br/>
(Bitch I'm gone) I need to breath, I got to roll<br/>
(I'm through wit'chu) Ain't no way<br/>
I can stay another day wit'chu<br/>
<br/>
Bye bye bitch, and wit all the other pussy, yeah<br/>

Still livin with ya grandmama buckin mouth ass<br/>
You shoulda known, you was fuckin with a mack (MACK)<br/>
Instead of steppin your game up, you got pushed way to the back<br/>
(Step off, step on back)<br/>
I seen yo' expression, when you seen me pimpin in the club<br/>
It looked like, it looked like you wanted to break down, down and cry<br/>
But I just didn't give a damn, I didn't give a damn, no no I didn't<br/>
Cause bitches ain't shit, anyway, so don't even ask me why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Soopafly]</i><br/>

<i>[Chorus - singers only version, in background]</i><br/>
