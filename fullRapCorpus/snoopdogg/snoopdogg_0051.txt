<i>[MP:]</i><br/>
(Ha ha) That's some real shit where the hot boys at,<br/>
Where the hot girls at <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Ya heard me? <i>[x2]</i><br/>
The game is to be sold not to be told, ha ha<br/>
Now this No Limit shit, No Limit nigga<br/>
Everbody wanna know how this shit happens, but we ain't playa hatin<br/>
And what's goin on, but ya know what?<br/>
It don't  get no realer than this though dog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS(x2)]</i><br/>

Mid-west niggas gettin bout it, UNGH!<br/>
South-side niggas gettin rowdy, UNGH! (yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop:]</i><br/>
Fuck that man,da game is to be sold, not to be told, 1st things 1st<br/>
I'm a gangsta, nigga, so I'ma roll<br/>
Ya got to get bout it or without it<br/>
I had to shake the spot cause the game got crowded<br/>
I'm devoted and quote it, I'm rowdy and bout it<br/>
A No Limit Soldier, and happy to shout it<br/>
Got this tank on my neck, got my tech. on deck<br/>
I slap raps at your caps and try to make my snaps<br/>
Nick-Nack patty-wack big happy sack, the dealer is back<br/>
And I'm ridin' through your neighborhood dippin' in my Cadillac<br/>
I'm sellin this shit, I ain't tellin this shit<br/>
I'm a mutha fuckin 2-time felon ya bitch<br/>
From the cold hearted streets of the LBC <br/>
To a mansion in the south down the street from my nigga P<br/>
See, real niggas recognize the realness<br/>
Put ya mutha fuckin choppers up if ya feel this<br/>
(Bust one) Now bust one(gun shot) Not just one <i>[2 gun shots]</i><br/>
And if ya want some get some, I bet we got some<br/>
Bustas discuss us, niggas poppin all the Ying-Yang<br/>
Still the Dogg Pound Gang (DPG, Man) <br/>
Beats still funky, Beats by the Pound in the house,<br/>
At the mutha fuckin door<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS(x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop:]</i><br/>
(Gettin rowwwdy) Everybody in the game, say the same<br/>
Is Snoop's still that gang bang cocaine nigga slangin everythang<br/>
I'm tryin to get as much as I need<br/>
While I fuck with these out of town hoes blowin all they weed (shut up)<br/>
Parlayin, so whatcha sayin<br/>
Bring a couple buddies witcha, girl we ain't playin<br/>
Baby must miss read me, cause she miss lead me<br/>
Has some niggas come by later (what?) and try to spray me (bitch)<br/>
But I'm just to quick, slick and sly<br/>
When it's time to ride I let the bullets fly cause it's do or die(die die...)<br/>
I wear blue 7 days out the week (for life)<br/>
I mob the street, DP, while I'm holdin my heat<br/>
I wanna warn you, shit they got killers on the East, Mid-West, up North, down<br/>
South in California<br/>
So if you got your chrome, you need to stay in the zone<br/>
And get a vest for your mutha fuckin dome<br/>
Cause it's on like a dog with out his bone<br/>
I'm in it to win it and No Limit is my home (for life for life)<br/>
Nigga, real niggas recognize the realness<br/>
Put ya mutha fuckin choppers up if ya feel this<br/>
(Bust one) Now bust one(gun shot) Not just one <i>[2 gun shots]</i><br/>
And if ya want some get some,(what up what up) I bet we got some (got some)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS(x4)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[MP:]</i><br/>
Nigga, bout it bout it ha ha<br/>
Snoop Dogg, Master P, and the whole No Limit mutha fuckin family nigga<br/>
From the South to the West to the East to the middle<br/>
To the mutha fuckin WORLD!<br/>
Ha ha real niggas and bitches unite
