Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick<br/>
For those who don't like it, eat a dick<br/>
But for those who with me, sing that shit<br/>
As it go a little something like this<br/>
<br/>
La Di Da Di, we likes to party<br/>
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody<br/>
We're, just some niggaz who're on the mic<br/>
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic (right)<br/>
For all my Doggs keepin y'all in health<br/>
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself<br/>
Cuz it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditionin<br/>
Which we create, cuz that's our mission<br/>
So listen close, to what we say<br/>
Because this types of shit happens every-day<br/>
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin<br/>
I gave myself a strech up, a mornin yawn and<br/>
went to the bathroom to wash up<br/>
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup<br/>
and said um "Mirror mirror, on, the wall<br/>
Who is the top Dogg of them all?"<br/>
There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted<br/>
The mirror said, "You are you conceited bastard"<br/>
Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef<br/>
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf<br/>
Used Oil of Olay, cuz my skin gets pale<br/>
And then I got the file, for my fingernails<br/>
I'm true to the style on my behalf<br/>
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath<br/>
Clean, dry, was my body and hair<br/>
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear<br/>
for all the bitches I might take home<br/>
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne<br/>
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks<br/>
Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks<br/>
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no<br/>
I went back in, I forgot my indo<br/>
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)<br/>
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)<br/>
This was a girl playin hard to get<br/>
So I said "What's wrong?" cuz she looked upset<br/>
She said um<br/>
<br/>
It's all because of you, i'm feelin said and blue<br/>
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days<br/>
I love you so, how much you'll never know<br/>
Cause you took your dope away from me<br/>
A-huh, a-huh, ahuh<br/>
<br/>
Damn, now what was I to do<br/>
She's cryin over me and she was feelin blue<br/>
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye<br/>
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"<br/>
Her mean mother steps then says to me "Hi!!"<br/>
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye<br/>
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet<br/>
Slammed the child on the hard concrete<br/>
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone<br/>
Somethin was wrong I said, "What was goin on?"<br/>
I tried to break up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her!"<br/>
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either!"<br/>
She grabbed my closely by my socks<br/>
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks<br/>
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick<br/>
They started cryin on my shoes and grabbin my dick<br/>
and sayin....<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you give me a play<br/>
So we can brake it down the Long Beach way<br/>
And if you give me that okay<br/>
I'll give you all my love today<br/>
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see<br/>
Somehow your words just hypnotize me<br/>
And I just love your jazzy ways<br/>
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay<br/>
<br/>
And on and on and on she kept goin<br/>
The bitch been around before my mother's born!<br/>
I said, "Cheer up!" so I gave her a hit<br/>
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!"<br/>
She said, "No you're not," then she starts cryin<br/>
I says I'm nineteen, she says, "Stop lyin!"<br/>
I says, "I am, go ask my mother<br/>
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"<br/>
Yeah, uhh, tic toc you don't stop<br/>
And to the, ah tic toc and you don't quit<br/>
Yeah, tic toc and ya don't stop, and to the<br/>
ah tic toc and ya don't quit, beeeotch!
