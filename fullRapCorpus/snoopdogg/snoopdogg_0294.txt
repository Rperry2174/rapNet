Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Hurry, hurry, write your number on the napkin right now<br/>
And if you feel it let me hear you say oh, cause I gotta go<br/>
Something's burning, you see the party people rocking side to side<br/>
And if you feel it let me hear you say oh, cause I gotta know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She DTF cause she's down to feel<br/>
That aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real<br/>
Are you a freak, or what?<br/>
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut<br/>
You crack me up<br/>
Are you a freak? So am I<br/>
So could we see eye to eye?<br/>
<br/>
You must like gold, I bet mind control that's coming out your television and radio<br/>
You must escape (say what) escape from here<br/>
Get intelligent when you hit that shit and let it go (go)<br/>
Far from here, let it go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You try to survive, you're under pressure cause you're running outta time<br/>
But this is not a chance you wanna blow, cause we gotta go<br/>
The deal is murder, you think long, you've been wrong, get it out your mind<br/>
Make you move when you hear them screaming oh, cause I gotta go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Why don't you swing, swing side to side?<br/>
Dear, dear, glide and glide<br/>
Swing, swing side to side<br/>
Dear, dear, do it one more time<br/>
Why don't you swing, swing side to side?<br/>
Dear, dear, glide and glide<br/>
Swing, swing side to side<br/>
Dear, dear, baby let that ride
