(Uncle Snoop Dogg.) <br/>
Yo' whassup, whassup. <br/>
(Could you read us a bedtime story?) <br/>
Alright, alright. <br/>
Ya'll get my ash tray, get my lighter. <br/>
I'm a read ya'll a gangsta bedtime story. <br/>
Come here, sit on my lap. <br/>
(Okay.)<br/>
Check it out.<br/>
<br/>
Great scotts, it's hot today<br/>
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest<br/>
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air<br/>
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care<br/>
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck<br/>
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck<br/>
Shooting like a muthafuckin vietnam vet<br/>
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set<br/>
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots<br/>
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop<br/>
You better have a spot up in town my nigga<br/>
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga<br/>
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat<br/>
Grease strikes you out with no get back<br/>
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat <br/>
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that<br/>
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me<br/>
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me<br/>
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all<br/>
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em<br/>
LBC in this muthafucka cuz<br/>
I had to show these niggas what time it was<br/>
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns <br/>
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves<br/>
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip<br/>
Or better yet, strapped a clip <br/>
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater <br/>
And put the ride down out of G two seater<br/>
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that<br/>
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that<br/>
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back <br/>
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack<br/>
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack<br/>
I brought the curl back and the golf hat<br/>
The black poker sack and this skandelous raps<br/>
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks<br/>
I brought snaps to the game nigga<br/>
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga<br/>
S-N double O-P fa sho<br/>
I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow<br/>
Oh once upon a time in the LBC<br/>
There lived a OG from the DPG<br/>
And all the little kids looked up to him<br/>
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him<br/>
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel<br/>
And all they hated on him because he was way to real<br/>
I don't know why but he's just so fly<br/>
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight
