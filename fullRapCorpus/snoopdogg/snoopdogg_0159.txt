<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Greetings loved ones<br/>
It's the big boss dog... Snoop D-oh-double-G<br/>
I want you just to lay back one time<br/>
And let yourself unwind<br/>
Yeah, this album number nine<br/>
I call it "Ego Trippin'"<br/>
Fo' shiggadal<br/>
Ain't nuttin to it but to do it<br/>
I know, I know, I know<br/>
I know y'all be trippin off how I be doin my thug thang on TV<br/>
But I never forget about what I love the most, and that's makin music<br/>
So uhh... I hope y'all... enjoy this shit right here<br/>
I took my time on this one<br/>
Oh yeah! Be on the lookout for QDT<br/>
That's Quik, Dogg and Teddy<br/>
Oh, my nigga Terrance Martin in this motherfucker too<br/>
Ay, press play homey!<br/>
Nah, on the real, press play!<br/>
Right NOW <i>[echoes]</i>
