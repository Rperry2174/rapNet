Radio Killa, Big Snoop D O dub<br/>
The American Dream<br/>
<br/>
Ayo nephew, come up off them keys<br/>
Sing a lil' somethin' for the ladies<br/>
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?<br/>
Let 'em know how we feelin' right now<br/>
<br/>
Every time I go around, shawty love me down<br/>
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that<br/>
She make it do what it do when we doin'<br/>
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that<br/>
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout<br/>
<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
Gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta love<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, she love it the way I put it on her<br/>
Blowin' trees, summer breeze, sippin' Corona<br/>
Lost dog I give it to her right and she like it<br/>
She on the hip like a psychic, izzy<br/>
<br/>
One of the coolest of fool on the flow<br/>
I whispered in her ear, come here you ready to go?<br/>
I bowled up a winna and put it up in the air<br/>
Got that low dress on you comin' up outta there, yeah<br/>
<br/>
She like that, you like that<br/>
You say you bite, well, I bite back<br/>
And I'm all go, we can do it till tomorrow<br/>
I beat it up like Harpo<br/>
<br/>
Snoopy, I go hard, baby, yes<br/>
Kissin' on yo' chest and I'm diggin' out your stress<br/>
I won't stop till yo' finished<br/>
But you ain't felt love till a gangsta get up in it, Dream<br/>
<br/>
Every time I go around, shawty love me down<br/>
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that<br/>
She make it do what it do when we doin'<br/>
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that<br/>
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout<br/>
<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
Gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta love<br/>
<br/>
She always cold in the middle of the night<br/>
'Cause I'm a dogg, I'm a give her what she like<br/>
She say my name loud, I say her name low<br/>
That's what I aim fo', that's how the game go<br/>
<br/>
Baby like the way I wake her up<br/>
'Cause I'm a gangsta, I grab her by the butt<br/>
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep<br/>
Woke that ass up just to put her to sleep<br/>
<br/>
Everyday is the same thang, I creep in<br/>
It's like true blood, I sink my teeth in<br/>
I gotta have it, the LB raisement<br/>
We was taught to dig 'em down crazy<br/>
<br/>
Lights out, I'm so lit<br/>
Mama's so gone, daddy won't quit<br/>
I won't stop till you're finished<br/>
But you ain't felt love till a gangsta get up in it, Dream<br/>
<br/>
Every time I go around, shawty love me down<br/>
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that<br/>
She make it do what it do when we doin'<br/>
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that<br/>
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout<br/>
<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
Gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta love<br/>
<br/>
This the life that you show<br/>
The loop, the coop, the grows<br/>
Anything goes<br/>
It's so good got her wigglin' her toes<br/>
<br/>
The boss, the dream<br/>
The floss, the cream<br/>
The trips overseas<br/>
All these things really don't mean a thing<br/>
<br/>
When I'm tearin' that ass up workin' you like a shift<br/>
I give it to you like a gift<br/>
You hear what that boy say, you wouldn't jack, give it up fast<br/>
Then I hit it from the back<br/>
<br/>
Snoopy you're so good, she screamin' and I like that girl<br/>
She off in another world<br/>
I ain't stop till you're finished<br/>
She love this gangsta especially when I'm in it, Dream<br/>
<br/>
Every time I go around, shawty love me down<br/>
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that<br/>
She make it do what it do when we doin'<br/>
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that<br/>
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout<br/>
<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
Gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta love<br/>
<br/>
Gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
Gangsta, gang, gangsta<br/>
That gangsta love
