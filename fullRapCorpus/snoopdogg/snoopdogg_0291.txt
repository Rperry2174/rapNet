<i>[Snoop Dogg (Mr. Porter):]</i><br/>
Alright I'm ready<br/>
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'...<br/>
For life, for life...<br/>
<br/>
(I like that)<br/>
Gangsta shit<br/>
(We gon')<br/>
Real smooth, you dig?<br/>
The big boss dogg<br/>
Snoop d-o-double-g<br/>
(See you niggas on <i>[?]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Mr. Porter:]</i><br/>
Cause my life's worth more than<br/>
The money that ya' live and die for<br/>
And where I'm from my nigga you get shot<br/>
For sellin' out your man when he the reason you got on<br/>
(I ain't trippin')<br/>
You know they say, that gangsters don't live that long<br/>
But how can I be here homes if I wasn't real-ly that strong<br/>
I pro'ly should be long gone<br/>
Tell me (Tell me, tell me, tell me)<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, what does it take to be dangerous<br/>
Everytime I look around, the game steady changin'<br/>
From coast to coast, rearranging<br/>
Them boys out west, we insist to keep it bangin' (Westside)<br/>
Ah yeah, we maintaining, burnin' up the charts, we spark, now we blazin'<br/>
My young home boy, he amazing<br/>
The cookie, rookie, shook him and took him<br/>
And now he famous (wow)<br/>
Couldn't quite picture that, wonder what he fishin' at<br/>
Now ya talkin' bout this and that<br/>
But pass that loc, I don't diss no mo'<br/>
I make number one hits, you know<br/>
Believe me, I make it look easy<br/>
You wanna know how to do it, then watch Snoop Deezie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, cuz, the game won't wait up<br/>
Dismissed all the beef and shook all the haters<br/>
And took on the new routine<br/>
Started coaching youth football to go straight clean<br/>
Like mean Joe Green, I step on the scene<br/>
They want an autograph and a picture, you know what I mean? (nah mean?)<br/>
I get to 'em, nigga, don't ask why<br/>
I'm real to my people, that's just how I ride<br/>
Yeah, since I slid in the do', I been at this<br/>
Some gangsta mack shit, but I did it with practice<br/>
Yeah, yeah, y'all know I get actin'<br/>
I live to learn, teach to reach my status<br/>
Top of the charts, have heart, have money<br/>
To have money, you gotta have heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's been thirteen years, no pain, no tears<br/>
Respected by all my peers<br/>
No matter where I'm posted at, my hands stay close to that<br/>
Ratta da dat dada dadat dadat<br/>
And as a matter of fact, no beef on the streets<br/>
No black on black. We gon' be all on one track<br/>
So I fall in ride or get lost in the pack<br/>
It's like that, fo' real, we ain't bluffin'<br/>
Right now it's West Coast or nothin'<br/>
I'll push that line and in due time<br/>
Y'all gon' respect this cause out here, fool, we rhyme<br/>
Oh, yeah, we bang, but right now it ain't time<br/>
So put away yo' nine, an' fall in line<br/>
(Tell 'em why)<br/>
<br/>
