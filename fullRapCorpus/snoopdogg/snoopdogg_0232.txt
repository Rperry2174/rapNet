<i>[Hook - Mike Posner:]</i><br/>
French inhale<br/>
I like the way you french inhale<br/>
Do it again<br/>
French inhale<br/>
I like the way you french inhale<br/>
Do it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Uhh, you ain't gotta sell it, cause its already sold<br/>
And you ain't gotta roll one cause its already rolled<br/>
Check out my technique, just weed, let it flow<br/>
Shit, I've been smoking since I was 14 years old<br/>
I had a dime that never smoked blunts, just bowls<br/>
Taught me how to blow O's, inhale through my nose<br/>
So if you see me smoking don't blow my high<br/>
Uhhh, so I roll one and we both gonna fly<br/>
You smell it all in my clothes<br/>
I'm taking in all the smoke when I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
French inhale<br/>
I like the way you french inhale<br/>
Do it again<br/>
French inhale<br/>
I like the way you french inhale<br/>
Do it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I take it to the face, inhale it through my nose<br/>
Blowing with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes<br/>
And crack-a-lac, peel it back<br/>
What you call a mack who crack a mad bitch like that?<br/>
A cracker jack<br/>
Im like a florist, touring like a tourist<br/>
Godzilla flyin on a pegasaurus<br/>
Niggas know about it, even fore I pull it out<br/>
I put some fire on it, and now they beggin me to put it out<br/>
I'm in the hallway, rolling on the purple psyche<br/>
I know the in's and out's so I'mma do what the fuck I like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
French inhale<br/>
I like the way you french inhale<br/>
Do it again<br/>
French inhale<br/>
I like the way you french inhale<br/>
Do it again
