It's time to slow it down, steadily grindin<br/>
And this is, the big Doggy Dogg..<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't talkin about no Air Force Ones<br/>
I just gotta know, before you let me get some<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?<br/>
I got to know, or you could show, me<br/>
Silk cotton see-through lace your sexy thong<br/>
I got to know, or you could show, me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Freak-a-leek, peak peak<br/>
Let a nigga sneak a few, peek-a-boo<br/>
Let's see what we can do<br/>
I'm bout freakin you, and sneakin you<br/>
Into a quiet place<br/>
So I can look at it face to face<br/>
Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton<br/>
I can tell, cause you like squattin<br/>
Your last dude, he was so rotten<br/>
And now your love is to be gotten<br/>
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind<br/>
But what I'm really tryin to do is ready between your pantylines<br/>
I know it seems oh so personal<br/>
But I'm just tryin to make you feel real comfortable<br/>
I know, so, what will it be?<br/>
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troublin me<br/>
Can I get a glimpse, one for the pimps?<br/>
I got one question, answer me this then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You came by the chuuch with a whole lot of body<br/>
Got invited to our annual pajama party<br/>
Workin that lace, I think it was the French cut<br/>
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt<br/>
Hidin it, should be dividin it<br/>
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it<br/>
And slide in it, real smooth like<br/>
with a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like<br/>
zoom boom hit the poom-poom right<br/>
Just to get your groove right<br/>
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it<br/>
When you gon' let a nigga have a look at it?<br/>
Callin all cars, yeah baby girl you a star<br/>
But it's on you if you wanna go real far<br/>
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps<br/>
I, have one question, answer me this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
