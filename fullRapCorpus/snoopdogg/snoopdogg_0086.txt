<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Yo.. uh-huh<br/>
I'ma try somethin different on this right here<br/>
but I know y'all gon' feel it<br/>
cause I know y'all feel me<br/>
It's some real shit right here, y'knahmsayin?<br/>
I ain't never did it like this before<br/>
Check this out..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop - singing]</i><br/>
I'm the kind of G that everybody knows<br/>
But I'm so low-key, when it comes to hoes<br/>
I never break the rules and that's just how it goes<br/>
All my friends and foes - know that's just how it goes<br/>
I can flip the script but I chose not to this time<br/>
There's so much to say with so little time, but I like it<br/>
(Yes I like it)<br/>
I'm gon' dip dive socialize and get high<br/>
I wish my people had, other ways<br/>
I'm thankful, that a brother's paid (that a brother's paid)<br/>
But how can I be happy?  My hair is still nappy<br/>
I miss my grandpappy<br/>
I wanna do right but the world is wrong<br/>
That's why I'm singin this song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song<br/>
Y'all niggaz better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)<br/>
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)<br/>
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song<br/>
You bitches better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)<br/>
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop - singing]</i><br/>
There's so much goin on out there in the world today<br/>
All these - ladies, players, gangsters, and suckers<br/>
I get caught up sometimes, some of the people I hang with<br/>
they turn out to be snitches, bitches, yeah they switches<br/>
But you know like I know I can't stop doin, what I got to do<br/>
I'ma keep doin what I got to (I'ma keep doin) y'know!<br/>
Everywhere I go, the game is the same<br/>
People lookin at me want me to say somethin<br/>
want me to do somethin, but I don't know nuttin<br/>
If I ain't gettin paid, I can't drop no rhymes<br/>
I can't do nothin for you no mo', I ain't got that kinda time<br/>
and they know..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ minor variations]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop - singing]</i><br/>
I try to be to myself, and try to stay.. away from the world<br/>
But the world just keeps runnin after me (runnin after me)<br/>
I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness<br/>
but somehow, the wickedness is in my circle - what am I to do?<br/>
I try to ask God to help me get through this<br/>
what am I to do to this?  Just do this, let's do this<br/>
So I, continue to mash, day by day (day by day)<br/>
I continue to play, play by play<br/>
And I con-tinue to spit my manuscript (spit it)<br/>
and say what I want to say (say it)<br/>
And I do it to ya ev-ery-day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ minor variations]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Leave me alone, I think you better leave me alone<br/>
Leave me alone, leave me alone - better leave me alone<br/>
If it don't pay you wrong, leave me alone<br/>
I think you better leave me alone, leave me alone<br/>
Leave me alonnnne, leave me alonnnne<br/>
If it don't pay you wrong..
