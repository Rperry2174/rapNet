Big Snoop Dogg <br/>
Occupation real<br/>
Conversation skill show you how to make a mill'<br/>
Pimpin'  cath me on tour<br/>
I headline the bill with beatufil bitches,<br/>
I done  been to brazil<br/>
Nigga, aks fo' real, my pockets is filled<br/>
Big money I'm the boss of my gangsta feel<br/>
They say they got the cure, I ain't takin the pill<br/>
I'm a stillkeep the gangsta after fifteen years<br/>
Ya digg<br/>
<br/>
Cant give it up gettin money the way that I live<br/>
The king of the west coast I'm runnin this shit<br/>
Big snoop dogg nigga you know what it is<br/>
The forty calli screw yo face like you fuckin with this<br/>
<br/>
No cure for the cash nigga my pockets big<br/>
Kush weed is the best, so why would I quit<br/>
High flyin in the ??<br/>
I drop em down pick em up yes I am the pimp<br/>
<br/>
What you thought, doggystyle all up in yo bitch<br/>
If theres a cure for getttin money theres the opposite<br/>
Never give it up, man I love this shit <br/>
Blunt after blunt, hit after hit<br/>
Six fo low ridin with the candy kidden<br/>
If theres a cure fo beein gangsta I dont want this shit. <br/>
<br/>
A mother fo the sunrise sposed to hit the block<br/>
Lil bad mothafucka pull the pockets pull the rocks<br/>
Learned to throw them thangs<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you why they call me snoop doggy dogg<br/>
I got a lot of bitches plus this nigga stay sharp<br/>
Now follow me, as I creep through the fog<br/>
Is secure for this shit you better keep It out of dodge<br/>
<br/>
Before I put you in some shit<br/>
You really got to swap, then call the hustle boys,<br/>
To get you mothafuckas robbed<br/>
<br/>
Is five in the mornin' <br/>
I climb in my zone, I'm from the LBC, <br/>
Where the climate is cold<br/>
And I know you player hatas got your eyes on my dope, <br/>
Cause I spit that real shit, <br/>
In your ear you can ??<br/>
Spend summers on the beach <br/>
Hidden gears on the boat<br/>
Fifty G's all in twennys keep the duffel bag closed<br/>
<br/>
What you call heat<br/>
Eat a nigga'ho <br/>
Fo you chain snatchion niggas tryna size up my gold<br/>
Its the problem, I dont need no antidote <br/>
No cure nigga, I let the wound heal slow<br/>
I gotta keep it gangsta makin moves  on the road<br/>
Tour bus full of weed smoke, bitches n' hoes<br/>
I've been doin this fo years<br/>
Nigga thats how it goes<br/>
<br/>
Is the big boss dogg I'm the truth untold<br/>
West coast camping no mean to brag the boss <br/>
The benz or the porche, I done have them both<br/>
Lil snoop count my money cut my fingers its mo<br/>
Its the celebration, grab yo glass n' toast<br/>
<br/>
West Coast!
