<i>[INTRO:(PRINCE ITIAL)]</i><br/>
Watch it!Watch it!<br/>
Daz is coming and there'll be no more waiting<br/>
Watch it!Watch it!<br/>
Kurupt is coming and there'll be no more waiting<br/>
Watch it!Watch it!<br/>
Doggystyle is coming and there'll be no more waiting<br/>
You might be shooting up close with the Itial ever lose respectin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1:(KURUPT)]</i><br/>
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind<br/>
Thinkin many plots blossoms how amny times?<br/>
I'm sedated my (?conscriptiated?) from beginning <br/>
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke<br/>
To my loccs way down in the Valley deep<br/>
To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach<br/>
To my bulls out in Philly coz all they smoke is phillies<br/>
Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches<br/>
Now really really ever slip or trip<br/>
A big shout out to my niggas in ??<br/>
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MCs like ships<br/>
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips<br/>
I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts<br/>
The homies catchin cases,robberies and assaults<br/>
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that<br/>
Listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BRIGDE:(DAT NIGGA DAZ)]</i><br/>
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop<br/>
Gotta get somewhere<br/>
When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop<br/>
Gotta get somewhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2:(DAZ,BAD AZZ,unknown)]</i><br/>
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid<br/>
Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself<br/>
Put em to rest,confess nevertheless<br/>
Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best<br/>
For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage<br/>
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast<br/>
And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat<br/>
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z<br/>
I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre<br/>
In '96,with a diff'rent approach I'm shit<br/>
I got the flavour and I'm major,bust the ass<br/>
Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us<br/>
Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya<br/>
When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya<br/>
I bet'cha I won't let ya escape<br/>
Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area<br/>
When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast<br/>
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone<br/>
Once again another zone is gone<br/>
MCs try to step they get lit and blown<br/>
<br/>
At the end the lights go out so before they do<br/>
I'm a L-B-C on through,stayin true<br/>
Demanding my respect,respect is what I've given<br/>
So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven<br/>
To the point of no return so the streets I roam<br/>
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black<br/>
.45 calibre Glock,gat,gun or pistol<br/>
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run<br/>
Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with<br/>
When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up<br/>
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it<br/>
With the every attempt they fail,oh well<br/>
Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers<br/>
The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-<br/>
I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips<br/>
Get in my way and get stepped on<br/>
I'm stompin,steppin with my projectile weapon<br/>
<br/>
Wuz up (?Jex?)so's eject the hum<br/>
When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?<br/>
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust<br/>
No ho is a must!If I bust<br/>
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max<br/>
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs<br/>
We wax tracks and smack up MCs who compose the violence<br/>
Bringin drama with no parental guidance<br/>
Eyes went deceived,somethin up my sleeve to intrigue<br/>
And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs <br/>
When we do the do to you so go call your crew<br/>
And who wants to compete with technique<br/>
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak<br/>
And what you say when I display<br/>
Sleepless acts as (?bombin ya?),suffer from insomnia<br/>
And I'm a gonna be comin for you<br/>
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew<br/>
(Watch out nigga!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[OUTRO:(SNOOP DOGG)]</i><br/>
It's the sucker MC barbecue cookout!Cookout!<br/>
Watch out now!<br/>
Ha-ha yeah wit'cha bad self.Watch out!
