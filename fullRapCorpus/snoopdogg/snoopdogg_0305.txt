Turn me up, turn me up<br/>
Just Blaze<br/>
<br/>
What's up, what's happening?<br/>
Big Snoop in this bitch, get it crackin'<br/>
Dickies creased up and they saggin'<br/>
Gat in the right side, left side flag<br/>
Niggas running at the lip again<br/>
Got me feelin' I'ma trip again<br/>
And you thought I wasn't listenin'<br/>
Bitches talk shit, got me walkin' like a Crip again<br/>
Gotta hit you with the re-up<br/>
I'm married to the streets, fuck a prenup<br/>
Ayy lil' nigga roll the weed up<br/>
Dre get my cup, we about to get G'd up<br/>
<br/>
Long Beach on my right side<br/>
CPT on my left side<br/>
I got Watts in this bitch<br/>
It be dogs from the 'jects still screaming out West Side<br/>
Long Beach on my right side<br/>
CPT on my left side<br/>
I got Watts in this bitch<br/>
Tiny loccs from the third and they screaming out East Side<br/>
<br/>
Bitch niggas still bang on 'em<br/>
50 Cal shots, let it rang on 'em<br/>
And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle<br/>
We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em<br/>
Bitch niggas  still bang on 'em<br/>
50 Cal shots, let it rain on 'em<br/>
And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle<br/>
We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em<br/>
Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em<br/>
Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em<br/>
But then again I ain't brainless<br/>
I'll have my little loccs hit you with the stainless<br/>
Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em<br/>
Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em<br/>
But I ain't tryna make ya famous<br/>
I'll have my tiny locos hit you with the stainless<br/>
<br/>
Shit you know who I be<br/>
D-O double G, super C-R-I-P<br/>
Creepin' through the fog<br/>
And steppin' through the smog<br/>
And you know I'm high as shit<br/>
And my bitches fly free<br/>
Shit you know who I be<br/>
D-O double G, super C-R-I-P<br/>
Creepin' through the fog<br/>
And steppin' through the smog<br/>
And you know I'm high as shit<br/>
And my bitches fly free<br/>
<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas wanna trip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas need that<br/>
<br/>
It's enough of that to go around<br/>
Real G's make the hood go 'round<br/>
Keep the planet spinnin' on it's axis<br/>
How is he so hood? How can you ask this?<br/>
I guess you can say I put in practice<br/>
On the strip, under lights, now I'm back bitch<br/>
And even if I'm blown on my own<br/>
With the chrome to your dome<br/>
Make you stretch like elastic<br/>
I need my real G's to the left<br/>
Bitch niggas staying to the right<br/>
I need my tool front and center<br/>
Hard on these scores from the Summer to the winter<br/>
Spring to the Fall, bitches still on my balls<br/>
It's the number one nigga from the hood  Doggy Dogg<br/>
Still pull up on a nigga when I need to be heard<br/>
I'm a killer and a stealer, but I ain't from Pittsburgh<br/>
Real niggas on the set, I get your whole clique served<br/>
You best observe, a B chalked out on the curb<br/>
With your momma and your people sayin' "Supercrip did it"<br/>
They won't testify, so he got away with it<br/>
Now I'm sttin' on my throne, on my bad phone<br/>
I'm talkin' to Iron man, smokin' on fireman<br/>
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane<br/>
Walkin' through the clouds with a Crip stick cane<br/>
<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas wanna trip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
Super Crip, who?<br/>
Super Crip, what?<br/>
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas need that
