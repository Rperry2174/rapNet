Once upon a time, in the L.B.C.<br/>
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street<br/>
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name<br/>
To make it interesting it's me, peep game<br/>
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad<br/>
And two step-brothers who treated me bad<br/>
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors<br/>
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores<br/>
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:<br/>
"We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"<br/>
And even worse than that, to make me feel low<br/>
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows<br/>
Girls used to say, "Snoop, you're so cute<br/>
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"<br/>
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue<br/>
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew<br/>
He said ah, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!<br/>
The princess is having a royal ball<br/>
If you can rap, also dress fresh<br/>
You might win a date with the sweet princess"<br/>
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash<br/>
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad<br/>
I said, "Step-dad, may I?"<br/>
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied (Cinderfella!)<br/>
My brothers were goin, they were gettin down<br/>
Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)<br/>
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted<br/>
"We can and you can't," is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)<br/>
They all stood there, laughin in my face<br/>
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"<br/>
<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
<br/>
Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss<br/>
And I'd get them back if I had one wish<br/>
Before I could make my thought a phrase<br/>
There appeared a man from a puff of haze<br/>
He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb<br/>
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!<br/>
Now I've came here with the main purpose<br/>
Of granting you your fondest wish"<br/>
I said, "Herb, my man, just make me fresh<br/>
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"<br/>
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot<br/>
And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit<br/>
On my feet was some white tube socks<br/>
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock<br/>
I showed him my sack, and don't you know<br/>
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe<br/>
Once again his hands began to flow<br/>
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)<br/>
He checked me over, passed me the keys<br/>
And said, "One more thing before you leave...<br/>
You must return before the stroke of twelve<br/>
Or you'll turn back into your old self"<br/>
<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
<br/>
I jumped in the low-low and went on my way<br/>
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say<br/>
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic<br/>
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)<br/>
The princess was starin, while holdin a drank<br/>
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank<br/>
She waved her hands like, "Hello!  Hi!"<br/>
Then gave another gesture like, "Come here, guy!"<br/>
I left the stage, girls came in flocks<br/>
The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks<br/>
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock<br/>
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock<br/>
No time to waste, I broke out in haste<br/>
The princess followed in a futile chase<br/>
A quick steady pace is what I kept<br/>
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps<br/>
For the six-fo' I continued my stride<br/>
About this time I heard gong five<br/>
I was down the block when I heard gong eight<br/>
And the princess screamed out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"<br/>
<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
<br/>
I was almost home when my luck ran out<br/>
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout<br/>
My fresh low-low, also went too<br/>
And there was no denyin that my night was through<br/>
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported<br/>
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded<br/>
Made it to my pad, no time at all<br/>
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall<br/>
Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased<br/>
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's<br/>
Early the next mornin, when I awoke<br/>
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat<br/>
Slid into the front, my family stared at me<br/>
Sayin, "Wasn't that you?  Nah, it couldn't be"<br/>
They kept askin me if I did my chores<br/>
My butt was saved by a knock at the door<br/>
"Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked<br/>
"The princess," this sweet voice remarked<br/>
She said she was lookin for a certain man<br/>
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand<br/>
The family ran around with their heads in the air<br/>
Bringin her shoes from everywhere<br/>
She just shook her head, a nod of relief<br/>
And said, "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"<br/>
I ran in the room and got my shoe<br/>
And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?"<br/>
Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute<br/>
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"<br/>
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light<br/>
And I was wearin shit, from just last night<br/>
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'<br/>
Yelled to my family, "I've GOT to go!"<br/>
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I<br/>
And in back of me, I heard my family cry...<br/>
<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)<br/>
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love<br/>
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
