<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Ride with you niggas like<br/>
Slide off that you're feeling right<br/>
All we got is you and me<br/>
I know what you need, girl<br/>
Smoke you some weed, girl<br/>
Sit back, let me take your time!<br/>
Impress the ladies, ain't no questions, baby<br/>
I got the answer for you and me<br/>
I put a smile on your face, let me take you to a place<br/>
Make you feel like Heaven!<br/>
<br/>
Put your make-up and your Gucci on<br/>
Rock star like, baby, camera, lights, movie's on!<br/>
Plus, I feel the vibe of what you want<br/>
You be doing that that cool thing<br/>
All the grown, new thing<br/>
I got you coming back, turn around, boomerang<br/>
Underground doing things<br/>
Girl, I know you like that<br/>
Don't get tough, sweet like a<br/>
Nigga like a track store, afraid to..<br/>
Try to catch a milly on! (Slow it down!)<br/>
Baby, let me catch up with you<br/>
Get that cake up, leg it down, wake up with you<br/>
Stand down, and taste the picture<br/>
I got a cool lil' skirt because I'm damn that mister!<br/>
I keep my plan on focus, my focus is you<br/>
We're cool as a one bo, we're cool as a two<br/>
Baby had your phone and I let it do what it do<br/>
I'm sitting in my whip outside, now step out and just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I like your flavor, you step your game up<br/>
Welcome to the majors with Soopafly, look alive!<br/>
We bang at the house, swimming pool, sip or die<br/>
Look at you, look at mine, looking good, wish you would!<br/>
Take it off, slide on me!<br/>
Work it like a Romeo, glide on it, make it cream<br/>
Double stuffed Oreo<br/>
I'm like the Mario, I got my chest out<br/>
Macking while I sit back, you can pull the rest out<br/>
I'm like a star is born, and I'm the next out<br/>
Pray to get your next out, slide to the left and<br/>
Now I'm looking at your best friend<br/>
Shoot back! I look at the mess we're in<br/>
And I don't play no games, though<br/>
Plus, that ain't what I came for<br/>
(No) I wanna slide out, smoke with you<br/>
Rub on your angle<br/>
Then give me head like a bankroll<br/>
I got a cool disposition, girl<br/>
I like you right in this position, girl<br/>
I'm the boss, get submissive, girl<br/>
Make you drop, turn around, it's your world<br/>
So you can just<br/>
<br/>
