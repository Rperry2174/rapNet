<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Cold game (cold game), new twist (new twist).<br/>
My niggaz step back and let me do this (do this)<br/>
Cuz I'm that 5-0 with em, getting 5-0's, sittin getting in the wind<br/>
For all my homies in the pen<br/>
It's back on<br/>
My backbone, my wife in my life &amp; down wit a nigga before my paper was tite.<br/>
Boo, you's a real bitch<br/>
I write that real shit<br/>
That them niggaz just got to get with<br/>
I bounce in and out of town just like a basketball player<br/>
Pass weed with the G's<br/>
And pass laws with the mayors<br/>
See, that's the difference between <br/>
You, me, and him<br/>
Nigga, I'm Silk the Slim<br/>
With the feather in his brim<br/>
I swim under water and don't get wet<br/>
Then bounce back to the hood and C-walk the set<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I stay on em like cop cars<br/>
Man, you watch your rabid-ass nine <br/>
Tryin to stop cars hoo-bangin this fast-lane game<br/>
It ain't a thang<br/>
I was learnin this game when you was servin your cane<br/>
It's where my shit's at<br/>
Flip rats tryin to get some get-back<br/>
Sit back, an holla at a playa bout: cold game<br/>
I stay Bout It (Bout It)<br/>
A bitch'll have you crossed up<br/>
An niggaz get you crossed out<br/>
I cant hang and bang wit y'all no more y'all niggaz flossed out<br/>
An papers what I'm all about<br/>
It's down that bullshit roll with y'all or take the baller<br/>
I take the baller out, he take the small amount<br/>
Long-term big shit<br/>
That's what I'm all about<br/>
Call em out, stall em out<br/>
Fuck em, I twist em<br/>
The hardhead never listen<br/>
They never recognize and they never pay attention<br/>
I stay G, and by the way did I mention: young nigga<br/>
