Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden...<br/>
<br/>
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks<br/>
Party don't rock like it used to rock<br/>
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock<br/>
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks<br/>
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks<br/>
Party don't rock like it used to rock<br/>
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock<br/>
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks<br/>
<br/>
Standin' amazing, hit you in the brain<br/>
Get with Snoop Dogg, he can put you in the game<br/>
Put you on the stage, maybe even front page<br/>
Get a little fortune, have a little fame<br/>
Kill 'em with class, toes to the boogie while you fill up your glass<br/>
So quick, so fast<br/>
No razzmatazz, I'm just an eastside nigga<br/>
With my gangster ass, twenties<br/>
I used to pinch pennies<br/>
Only Gs, I don't fuck with no <i>[?]</i><br/>
My clique is sick, it expandin'<br/>
To outlaws, riders and bandits<br/>
What you gon' do<br/>
When we coming to a hood near you?<br/>
<br/>
You know I used to come through with the tools and Glocks<br/>
Party don't rock like it used to rock<br/>
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock<br/>
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks<br/>
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks<br/>
Party don't rock like it used to rock<br/>
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock<br/>
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks<br/>
<br/>
What's beef? 'Cause beef is in the kitchen<br/>
What you want dog? I'm on a million-dollar mission<br/>
How can you get it if you ain't been through shit?<br/>
I'm just a seed that was planted by Ruthless<br/>
My family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC<br/>
Crybaby, used to C-Walk at the park<br/>
Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark<br/>
Real love, real dubs, real <i>[?]</i><br/>
Trip Locc, kin folk, and Wayniac<br/>
Peace to the deceased that passed away<br/>
"Duces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way"<br/>
What you gon' do<br/>
When we pull up in a hood near you?<br/>
<br/>
You know I used to come through with the tools and Glocks<br/>
Party don't rock like it used to rock<br/>
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock<br/>
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks<br/>
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks<br/>
Party don't rock like it used to rock<br/>
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock<br/>
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks<br/>
<br/>
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, certified official gangsta shit<br/>
Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga<br/>
Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls<br/>
It's either hog status or buster status<br/>
It ain't no in betweens<br/>
You can't wake up and put this on, nigga<br/>
Every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit<br/>
Clappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches<br/>
Mansion business and stackin riches<br/>
It's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow<br/>
Gs up, forever<br/>
The boss dogg an' Tha General, front line and on the east side
