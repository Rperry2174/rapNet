<i>[Charlie Wilson croons in the background]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Beautiful.. perfect.. flawless.. debonaire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]</i><br/>
Where'd you get that silky skin?<br/>
And the colors those eyes come in?<br/>
Does the light come from within?<br/>
God made you, did he make the grin?<br/>
Wings are under all your clothes<br/>
You worth more than your weight in gold<br/>
Where did God put down your mole<br/>
Or were you only made for show?<br/>
Girl you're perrr-feeeect - when God made you<br/>
I wonder if he kept the mold, or are you just for show?<br/>
Girl you're perrr-feeeect - when I see you<br/>
it takes my mind to cloud nine, girl you're so fine, yeah - hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Lovable, and yeah you're pursuable<br/>
Everything is beautiful, even down to your cuticles<br/>
It ain't about me, it's all about you<br/>
You make me do what you want me to<br/>
Yeah, it's just like that<br/>
Here go my number baby girl why don't you get right back<br/>
You're a, perfect dime, I'm workin mine<br/>
Just the thought of me and you I mean it's blowin my mind<br/>
Cain't explain it doe, but if I'm wit'chu<br/>
I can't remain a ho, or stay in the flow<br/>
It's a shame to know, I maintain the flow<br/>
Baby girl me and you is unexplainable<br/>
Mm, yeah - we need to get into actin<br/>
Cain't you see this is a natural attraction<br/>
A lot of maxin and relaxin<br/>
C'mon baby girl, give a player some action, I'm askin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
If you would, if I could<br/>
You make the bad boy in me go good<br/>
Tell a lie?  No I tell the truth<br/>
Baby boo on the real you know you hundred proof<br/>
Mm, I can't even believe that<br/>
You livin the single life, damn I need that<br/>
I hate to see a queen without a king<br/>
If I had you I'd get you e'rything<br/>
Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago<br/>
See my baby go wherever I go<br/>
Costa Rica, Obregato<br/>
If I get you I hit the lotto<br/>
Loco shoppin, get what you want to<br/>
Sky's the limit, so go on and spend it<br/>
I said it cause I meant it<br/>
So go and give me your love and get in it to win it<br/>
Hit it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Mm, I know you dig my rappin<br/>
I see you smilin so I might get some action<br/>
Yeah, so let's get it crackin<br/>
It won't be no +Rerun+, "Hey hey hey - +What's Happenin'+?"<br/>
It won't be no type of scrappin<br/>
Me and you, this is everlastin<br/>
I hate to sound sarcastic<br/>
But we'll make a classic, it'll be fantastic<br/>
We need to get into actin<br/>
Cain't you see this is a natural attraction<br/>
A lot of maxin and relaxin<br/>
C'mon baby girl give a player some action, I'm askin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg (Charlie Wilson ad libs)]</i><br/>
Mm, the perfect girl, livin in the perfect world<br/>
Like I said, I hate to see a queen without a king<br/>
I'm available, let's make it happen<br/>
Yeah, the dime or the dub, how you love that?<br/>
Ha ha ha<br/>
Yeah, 'Beautiful Part 2' - thought you knew
