<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Bada-bing, bada-boom, what a dogg gotta do?<br/>
Let me holler at you boo, damn I miss you<br/>
I just wanna kiss you, and all that good stuff<br/>
Was I really all that bad or was I good enough?<br/>
I'm under pressure, I can't run plays like this<br/>
My mama always said that there'll be days like this<br/>
I'm all alone by the phone, in a zone, face is stone<br/>
Wonderin', if you ever comin' home<br/>
I try to run the streets and play<br/>
But that feeling just won't go away<br/>
My whole life I'd throw away, to get you back on my team<br/>
Damn, why'd you have to go away?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'<br/>
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'<br/>
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me<br/>
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy<br/>
<br/>
(Why did you leave me?)<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
(Why did you leave me?)<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
Mama told me there'll be days like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I get up early in the mornin', miss your rudeness and kissin'<br/>
I also miss that smell of that good breakfast in the kitchen<br/>
Listen, I'm a star but I'm wishin'<br/>
To follow you wherever you are<br/>
You the wheels to my car, and I can't roll without you<br/>
My heart is a ice box, it's cold without you<br/>
Why'd you have to, leave me this way?<br/>
I'm doin' bad, you don't wanna see me this way<br/>
I'm at the pad, tryin' to do my best<br/>
I'm so stressed, and yes I'm still the King of the West<br/>
Tryin' to manage, and I'm gon' handle it<br/>
I need you back in my life, 'cause I'm tired of livin' scandalous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'<br/>
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'<br/>
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me<br/>
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy<br/>
<br/>
(Why did you leave me?)<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
(Why did you leave me?)<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
Mama told me there'll be days like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Oh my Lord, I'm sittin' at the board with my head down<br/>
I can't write my next line, I need to lay it down<br/>
Hmm, I'm stuck like a dump truck<br/>
Lookin' stupid, cupid down on my luck<br/>
I touch a four leaf clover<br/>
Hopin' for somethin' good, like I should<br/>
If not I guess it's over<br/>
Baby be real with it<br/>
Do you love me, do you miss me?<br/>
I can't deal with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'<br/>
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'<br/>
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me<br/>
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy<br/>
<br/>
(Why did you leave me?)<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
(Why did you leave me?)<br/>
You can't leave me by myself like this<br/>
Mama told me there'll be days like this
