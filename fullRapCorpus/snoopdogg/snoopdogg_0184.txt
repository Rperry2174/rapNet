<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
1800, I'm blunted, fa cert'<br/>
Snoop D-O-dub', pocket full of dubs<br/>
All my niggaz dubs, rollin on candy<br/>
Feelin like meh, square bitches can't stand me<br/>
Hey! My niggaz turnt up, I'm a beast bitch<br/>
West coast, I'm on the East bitch<br/>
When I'm in the place, the hoes lose it<br/>
They say they love me, and the music<br/>
The spot jerkin, they be gettin low<br/>
She wanna roll, that's what I'm here fo'<br/>
I threw a grand up, and watch it come down<br/>
That ain't for you bitch, I like to hear the sound<br/>
Now put your hands up, I wanna see you work<br/>
She blew a kiss, I blew the purp'<br/>
I'm geeked up girl, I'm on my tip too<br/>
My niggaz all on, and I'ma get you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
1800, I'm blunted, fa cert'<br/>
Snoop D-O-dub', I'm higher than a mug<br/>
Cameras goin off all the chickens want hugs<br/>
And when I'm on the bill I fa'sho' fill the club<br/>
E'rybody know me, nigga I'm a star<br/>
Long Beach Laker, see the faces in the car?<br/>
Pimpin what it do, she poppin like a pill<br/>
1800 then my hand made it spill<br/>
Your party on E, if Snoopy don't come<br/>
You smoke about a zone, I smoke about a drum<br/>
Burnt in the club, my hands on her thigh<br/>
A Eastside nigga put his hood in the sky<br/>
She like what I say, I like what she do<br/>
Turn that ass around and drop it like a fool<br/>
I'm geeked up girl, I'm on my tip too<br/>
The homies all on, but I'ma get you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
1800, I'm blunted, fa cert'<br/>
Snoop D-O-dub', turn that shit up<br/>
I don't buy bub, tequila got me goin<br/>
Burnt in the club, and e'rybody known<br/>
Nigga I'm a boss, I do what I do<br/>
Millionaire status, nigga who is you?<br/>
My locs on bright, baby look at me<br/>
She like how I talk, I get it from the P<br/>
Lil Jon did it, the party goin dumb<br/>
Put it in the air, listen to the drum<br/>
Snoop Dogg said it, we gettin turnt up<br/>
Swishers all around, gettin burnt up<br/>
Look at how I do, I grab her by the waist<br/>
Whisper in her ear, then I touch her on the face<br/>
I'm geeked up girl, I'm on my tip too<br/>
E'rybody on, but I'ma get you (LET'S GO!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Jon]</i><br/>
OA-KAYYY!
