Would you be with me if I had nothing?<br/>
<br/>
Wuddup tho? Niggas and niggettes, this yo boy<br/>
Big Snoop D-O-double G<br/>
Comin' at yo ass with That's My Work Volume 2<br/>
If you don't you work, you don't eat<br/>
Yes sir, yes sir<br/>
Coming at you live and direct with this motherfuckin gangsta music mane<br/>
You thought I was gone?<br/>
No, I'm back on my shit mane<br/>
Can't stop, won't stop<br/>
Volume two<br/>
You don't you work, you don't eat<br/>
That's My Work, let's go<br/>
<br/>
Yall ready?<br/>
Oh yea<br/>
Lil something for 2013 on yo ass<br/>
Still going strong<br/>
Oh yea<br/>
Nothing but the dogg in me nigga<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen a Venus and Serena?<br/>
Baby wanna smoke with her, she gotta pop a green one<br/>
Hand on my Nina, leanin' in my beamer<br/>
No time for sleep 'cause nothing comes to dreamers<br/>
All I'm bout is getting it, east side reppin' it<br/>
Shout out to my homies in the hood that's on a different shit<br/>
Scrambled like I'm Robert Griff<br/>
Gon keep on drivin it<br/>
Walk up in the strip club<br/>
These hoes is steady poppin' it<br/>
I'm a cribglomerate<br/>
I get what Obama get<br/>
Could've been yo daddy boy 'cause I know where yo mama live<br/>
Put the kids to bed, take a bleezy to the head<br/>
Yea, that's what the homie said<br/>
<br/>
Word of mouth, the streets talkin<br/>
I'm in the C-Town, dickin' down the sea hawk<br/>
She love the way a G talk, conversation, demonstration<br/>
Hit er with that street walk<br/>
Crill?<br/>
<br/>
Yea man<br/>
I know you thought<br/>
You thought you thought huh?<br/>
I ain't went nowhere homie<br/>
I gotta stay true to what I do, ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
Back up on my good foot, feelin like an actor<br/>
Back in '88, sold yogurt out the wrapper<br/>
Then I became a rapper<br/>
Money up front but I guide it up to back er<br/>
New shoes, new clothes<br/>
All for the fuck of it<br/>
Played my cards right so it's safe to say I struck it rich<br/>
Givin back, takin care of everybody<br/>
I'm doin bad, homie don't you worry bout it<br/>
Walk the walk and try to talk the talk<br/>
I'm tryin to give you more than just food for thought<br/>
If you movin while you grooving<br/>
Hopin' that you won't get caught<br/>
Never let em know about it<br/>
Only let em hear about it<br/>
Hit that paper, read about it<br/>
<br/>
Word of mouth, the streets talkin<br/>
I'm in the D-Town, droppin' off a sea hawk<br/>
Hit her with some G talk<br/>
And slide off with that east side long beach sea walk, ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
That's my work<br/>
I'm in overtime mode<br/>
You call this time and a half<br/>
Snoop, Drama
