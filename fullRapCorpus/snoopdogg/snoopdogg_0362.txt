<i>[Intro: Big Pimpin]</i><br/>
Just another day in the motherfucking neighbourhood<br/>
A pimp's waking up and he's feeling good<br/>
Versace to the flow<br/>
He didn't even mess with the taylor made shit today y'all<br/>
Smelling good with his reptiles on for sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm waking up in the morning, man I'm mourning; what's wrong?<br/>
My Nigga Corleone gone in my Zoning, but I'm boning, out to school<br/>
Cause I can't be late, cause they'll lock the gate<br/>
And it's damn near eight, that's when the bell ring<br/>
I'm a slide on in, and come right on in<br/>
And once I bail through the hallways, giving it up<br/>
Funky fresh stars and khakis, cool living it up<br/>
What up? - the same shit trying get paid and stay strong<br/>
Lunchtime, I make my way to get my grub on<br/>
Ten minutes to one, feeling good like I should for sure<br/>
Fourth period; walk through the door<br/>
I'm wreaking and smelling like endo<br/>
But still the day moves on to 2:44; one minute left to class<br/>
By Warren G, the Twins and Daz<br/>
Nate Dogg finna scoop us up in a blue drop top Brouham<br/>
I hear some bitches from Wilson wanna tag.. along<br/>
And get up, for the get-down<br/>
Word got around about the niggaz from the Piddound<br/>
We keep the whores on point, to join on lit<br/>
And keep heat discreet, until the shit jump off<br/>
Well we're all from the side, so we won't ask why<br/>
So you best get high!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: X2]</i><br/>
Too high, so fly, like Snoop is poly high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wayniac]</i><br/>
See I... took advantage cause I live right next door <br/>
to the funkhouse, dunkhouse with the whole show<br/>
Niggaz know how we go; from first 'til four we don't show<br/>
Lunch and then the last whore<br/>
It's getting dealt with some melt shit I guess<br/>
We smoke the Stress, cause my quest wasn't chronic yet<br/>
Little niggaz growing up with my dogs <br/>
Cause we pack the hogs, exercise for my balls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Trip Locc]</i> <br/>
Stacked bigger than I thought it would be<br/>
Me and the family, working on TV, get paid and fuck their enemy<br/>
Moving on up, like the Jeffersons but quicker<br/>
All we think about is finding ways to get richer<br/>
Hit you like some dodo, got you're begging for more<br/>
It's a trip, I'm serving on the solo<br/>
Low blow, I had you feeling me<br/>
I got some C-O-N-V-O for your community<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]</i><br/>
I'm still in a fast lane state of mind<br/>
Time is impossible, for me to try to find<br/>
I'm out of school on the line<br/>
Hustling here and there, never show no fear<br/>
Hosted it up on a watch, I posted it up with a glock<br/>
PCH in atlantic, is what you see just don't panic<br/>
It's me, Snoop rocks and when my homies get static<br/>
Got a pistol that blasts like a cannon<br/>
Look out for when we form at the wall, nigga where you standing? <br/>
Raise up, realize, street lights magnify<br/>
Life is giving; don't let it pass you by<br/>
I'm here and there with the bud, conversating with the drink<br/>
Shocked in my own zone, got time to think<br/>
Cause what would I be, if I wasn't who I am<br/>
Maybe dead or in jail, maybe time'll never tell<br/>
Approach me wrong and you will get chin checked<br/>
To disrespect my clique, and you will get dealt with<br/>
Uhh.. plain and simple, nevertheless with the best shit available<br/>
Test me now, let me see how brave you are<br/>
I'm scott free, so it's on like it used to be<br/>
D-O-G-G P-O-U-N-D G-C, for life, two times 'til I die<br/>
Oh why, Oh why, life is a challenge when you die?<br/>
What's the peak for me, is the cash and the strap<br/>
Since the 2-1-3 days been like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Big Pimpin]</i><br/>
Feeling very playish, ha.. I mean very plash<br/>
And the bitches saying: why shouldn't he?<br/>
Yeah he should; doing what he does and he does it good<br/>
He goes to work, yeah, he does it good<br/>
On pavement or dirt, checking the skirt<br/>
The story of a Pimp's Life, yeah baby<br/>
You gotta have the stomach for this shit, Hoo weeee<br/>
To fuck with this, the story of a Pimp's Life<br/>
Ohh yes baby, honey suckle to a berry<br/>
Got to check; the traps, got to check the dollars<br/>
Got a doctorate from the street called: Peace Mack of Diamond Net<br/>
A scholar with my niggaz from the underground <i>[Echoes]</i>
