<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yo Doc what up my nigga<br/>
Snoop Dogg, it is what it is<br/>
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man<br/>
And i think it's time for me and you to just<br/>
Turn it down a bit<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Imagine it never happened<br/>
Imagine no rappin'<br/>
Imagine niggaz trapped<br/>
Imagine it havin' action<br/>
Imagine how niggaz could be actin'<br/>
If you never got this shit crackin<br/>
Imagine life's so hard<br/>
You can't imagine it's like livin' in city of god<br/>
You feel me<br/>
Imagine life on the yard<br/>
I'm tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job<br/>
Imagine Biggie with his son<br/>
Imagine Pac gettin' call pop 'bout one<br/>
Imagine a mother strugling<br/>
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son<br/>
Imagine life you can't win<br/>
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen<br/>
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz<br/>
When you put back to the streets you get right back in<br/>
Imagine Russell still strugling<br/>
No Def Jam it's anotoher nigga hustlin'<br/>
And no rocks on them fellaz<br/>
Just rocks on them fellaz<br/>
Just try and keep it bubblin'<br/>
Imagine niggaz just stoped<br/>
From the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up<br/>
I can't imagine no less<br/>
But it don't take imagination<br/>
To know niggaz been bless with<br/>
HIP-HOP<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Before we go<br/>
Can you imagine?<br/>
Picture years, with your mom<br/>
Can you imagine?<br/>
Hang her picture in the sky<br/>
Can you imagine?<br/>
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells?<br/>
Imagine being tossed around and put in jails<br/>
Imagine life when you can't get from under<br/>
Imagine niggaz at ya when you done fo'<br/>
Remember when they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch<br/>
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit<br/>
We act like we hate to see you gun hoe<br/>
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know.<br/>
Imagine niggaz in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg &amp; D-R-E,<br/>
And felt just like the niggaz in the 2-1-3.<br/>
Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me.<br/>
Imagine you was up on top of this shit<br/>
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick<br/>
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit<br/>
Imagine if my niggaz got together and tow up this bitch, yeah<br/>
You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done<br/>
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run<br/>
Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' on somebodies son<br/>
Imagine if these niggaz neva saw a colour<br/>
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggaz kill each other<br/>
All the drunk fool gets pissed on balls<br/>
He fuckin' off my niggaz, they gone murder us all<br/>
Imagine that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
