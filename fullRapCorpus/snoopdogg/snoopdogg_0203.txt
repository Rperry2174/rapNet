Take it back to the afros and the naturals<br/>
Cape cutter picks we slips into the back <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm O.G. my nigga for real though<br/>
Straight up off that east side top of the hill yo<br/>
I'm looking at the overview<br/>
Thinking bout 86 damn I was overdue<br/>
Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood<br/>
While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood<br/>
That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy<br/>
<i>[?]</i> oops a daisy<br/>
Demon or a heathen scheming while I'm dreaming<br/>
Screaming to get even seeing is believing<br/>
And don't you forget that<br/>
Get it to you get back hit that kick back<br/>
Three flies one a way<br/>
Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say<br/>
Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quick trying to be grown<br/>
Day turn to night and play turn to fight<br/>
Yeah I guess my granny was right<br/>
<br/>
Reflections of the way life used to be<br/>
It's all right<br/>
<br/>
I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills<br/>
I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight<br/>
Make it back to my ride<br/>
Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side<br/>
My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo<br/>
Slid me away just to get me away<br/>
I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood<br/>
I'm banging riding but doing it good<br/>
When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering<br/>
As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred<br/>
With the dealers the killers the <i>[?]</i><br/>
The best from the west and the beast from the east<br/>
Yeah I'm acting a fool<br/>
I'm getting my degree from gladiator school<br/>
I chose this life cause I knows this life<br/>
Sell a little crack and my flows is tight<br/>
I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is<br/>
I can still hear my grandma's voice<br/>
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight<br/>
Yeah I guess my granny was right<br/>
<br/>
Reflections of the way life used to be<br/>
It's all right<br/>
<br/>
If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk<br/>
And these was the rules squeeze on these fools<br/>
I came up in a different era homie<br/>
Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it<br/>
Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like<br/>
Now who you wanna be like<br/>
That fool on the TV screen<br/>
Or the homie on the corner getting major cream<br/>
In the Cadillac beating like Battle Cat<br/>
A nigga with money don't know how to act<br/>
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts<br/>
All money nonsense yeah none of that<br/>
Quarter sack run it back<br/>
Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that<br/>
If a trick jump the track do you want your money back<br/>
Lil bitch was a bunny rat<br/>
Watch for the funny hat<br/>
Cause it's gonna come<br/>
And my granny said it's no fun<br/>
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight<br/>
Yeah I guess my granny was right<br/>
<br/>
Reflections of the way life used to be<br/>
It's all right
