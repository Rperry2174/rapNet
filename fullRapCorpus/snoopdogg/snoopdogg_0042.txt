<i>[Snoop Talking]</i><br/>
What's up baby can I get with you?<br/>
Its called dogs get lonely 2<br/>
Bow-wow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I dont give a damn, what your homies say<br/>
You don't stay on me, your always out to play<br/>
Your so hard to find, seems your shaking me<br/>
D.O.G.'s we get lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Look here babygirl D.O.G.'s we get lonely<br/>
You can ask all my homies, all D.P.G. got tenderoni's<br/>
Now when we on the road trying to get this paper<br/>
and phone call away is what you say<br/>
But some times you got to find time to get up<br/>
to get out and get away You feel me<br/>
Now all I want to do is stay real and stay true<br/>
I'm trying to have a little something, and keep you satisfied, but <br/>
(when) my homeboys say its time to ride then I'm a ride<br/>
See I'm a gangsta I'm a always be a gangsta you cant change me<br/>
Dispite at night I might get lonely ya heard me come and serve me<br/>
I'd love to take you to the mall<br/>
buy you a little somthing go to the movies too<br/>
If thats what you want to do, thats what you trying to do<br/>
thats what we going to do<br/>
Now I'm a put you on a back burner<br/>
cause I got to get this cheese with my crew<br/>
But baby momma full of drama aint that right<br/>
D.A.Z. dog's get lonely too<br/>
Now you knew the dog was dangerous and you took it<br/>
You got good loving<br/>
You hook me up a good meal<br/>
but you still couldnt hook me<br/>
Let me stop lying, I'm trying to be too cool, I shaking the real<br/>
All my homies do y'all know D.O.G.'s can get lonely too thats real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Talking]</i><br/>
Yo yo check this out baby<br/>
Im not even going to rap on this one<br/>
I'm not I'm not much of a rapper at all<br/>
But check this out I'm a put this P.I. down to you real small<br/>
I mean I got to get this money I'm out here hanging with my homeboys<br/>
We do what we do we been doing this<br/>
before I even met you you know what I'm saying<br/>
Times get hard my homies gone be there I know you there for me<br/>
I know you want to do those things that<br/>

I mean when I get lonely I'm a holler at you<br/>
You gone be there for me<br/>
Thats real<br/>
