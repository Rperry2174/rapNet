Yeah man...<br/>
<br/>
"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin<br/>
but when it comes down to the action part, the most folks take a little<br/>
light vacation"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man<br/>
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me<br/>
And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me<br/>
On some real talk like...<br/>
<br/>
It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers<br/>
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low<br/>
Nobody's guidance so I decided to sleep by the do'<br/>
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'<br/>
Driftin off into another stage of life<br/>
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight<br/>
Niggaz ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no<br/>
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind<br/>
Many men were eradicated by music minds<br/>
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize<br/>
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time<br/>
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty<br/>
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body<br/>
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest<br/>
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Fuck that nigga, I'ma do it right<br/>
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like<br/>
for me to be mad, saying, "Niggaz can't stand me"<br/>
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's<br/>
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more<br/>
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl<br/>
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow<br/>
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though<br/>
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI<br/>
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme<br/>
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual<br/>
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual<br/>
Tryin to change the direction of flowin<br/>
And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"<br/>
<br/>
Ain't been nobody to change game since King came<br/>
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged<br/>
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope<br/>
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable<br/>
And they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way<br/>
Go that way, roll that Jay<br/>
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony<br/>
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it<br/>
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'ma do it<br/>
And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"<br/>
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse<br/>
Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first<br/>
You can never beat a hoe, lemme show you how to treat a hoe<br/>
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable<br/>
(So...) Got a way to get his own music out<br/>
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad<br/>
Take my time, with my.. great mind<br/>
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it<br/>
Thanks to niggaz who might make it illegal<br/>
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples<br/>
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters<br/>
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adida's<br/>
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks<br/>
Givin niggaz a puff, still givin it up<br/>
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggaz is up<br/>
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
We bust 'til we buss 'em up<br/>
(Lay Low), I know they told you not to fuck with us<br/>
Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain<br/>
Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane<br/>
And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit<br/>
You couldn't spit the shit that I spit 'cause I'm the shit<br/>
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips<br/>
And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch<br/>
I'm through with this! <i>[crowd cheers]</i>
