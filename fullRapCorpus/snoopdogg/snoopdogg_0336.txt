Ayo, K-Dot? You up on that new Snoop Dogg? That nigga shit banging!<br/>
I ain't fuckin' with none of these new niggas, but that nigga, Snoop Dogg? That nigga back!<br/>
Right, right, he a wild lil nigga. But that's where you're wrong at lil homie; big Snoop never left!<br/>
<br/>
I'm still here<br/>
Yeah, chada-di-da-da<br/>
Sugar...<br/>
Yah, man...<br/>
Check it<br/>
<br/>
Didn't think I would last, I'm adrift on a draft<br/>
While I'm flippin' my craft, hold a gift to the gab<br/>
Cre-i-zippin' my rag see, hop on the grass<br/>
Peep-pop on these suckers tryna avoid the clash<br/>
But if I must I must, let me raise my glass<br/>
Tryna move on off and put you on up - some fresh game<br/>
Or how to maintain, sustain and gangbang<br/>
You never change, you stay the same<br/>
It sound easy, don't it? I put a lot on it<br/>
I be Dogg on it, I really want it<br/>
Achieve at the speed that you work at<br/>
And these is the G's we the throwbacks<br/>
Battlecat on the track<br/>
There is just no way you can call that a comeback<br/>
We done that, we run that, from the top back little to the front<br/>
We only here to give you what you want<br/>
Blaze it, one!<br/>
<br/>
When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you<br/>
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there<br/>
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you<br/>
Just turn me on, turn me out and let me play<br/>
Lada-di-di-da-da!<br/>
<br/>
Horse and a carriage<br/>
Sports in a marriage, all in a day's work<br/>
Show you how these plays work<br/>
Longevity, heavenly blowing kush heavily<br/>
Rearange my melody, no more felonies<br/>
Shout-out to my mama Beverly, and my grandmother the elderly should be upheld to the utmost<i>[?]</i><br/>
Half the reason why I'm great<br/>
Mississippi the state<br/>
Let me shake back <i>[?]</i> back to the beat<br/>
And keep supplying yall with more heat for the street<br/>
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Lion, it's all the same<br/>
One thing's for sure, this shit bangin<br/>
Achieve at the speed that you work at<br/>
See these is the G's and we the throwbacks<br/>
Battlecat on the track<br/>
There is just no way you could call it a comeback<br/>
Been there done that<br/>
<br/>
When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you<br/>
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there<br/>
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you<br/>
Just turn me on, turn me out and let me play<br/>
Lada-di-di-da-da!<br/>
<br/>
Lada-di-di-da-da!<br/>
Yeahma, Snoop Lion<br/>
Snoop Dogg, hehe!<br/>
I'm still here!<br/>
