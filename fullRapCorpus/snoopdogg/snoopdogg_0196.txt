<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
From the hood, to the valley, from yards, to the alleys<br/>
"Wonderland" in demand and the man is "Malice"<br/>
O.G.'s blow trees, gold keys to the palace<br/>
Gangbang on 'caine maintain for the challenge<br/>
and shank ya, bank ya, levitate ya, spray ya<br/>
Butch (Cassidy!) Come with some gangster flavor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Butch Cassidy]</i><br/>
On my block, I handle my deep business every day<br/>
I hustle, on the streets I do it the old fashioned way<br/>
I roll out, with some girls that's from the hood<br/>
They love me, that's understood<br/>
And we burn trees that's so good, damn, we, should<br/>
Daily, I stay G'd up with my khakis and my 'gars<br/>
Burn, then I pick up my two dogs and bend the curb<br/>
That's gangsta, gotta grab a fresh <i>[?]</i> bud<br/>
Now I bend it up like a thug<br/>
And my Chrysler on two dubs, plus, G'd, up<br/>
I keep it gangsta fo' sho', because it's all that I know<br/>
The only way that I roll, the only way that I'll go I'm so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]</i><br/>
SO gangsta, I'm so, SO gangsta<br/>
So gangsta - SO gangsta, we are, I'm sooooooo<br/>
SO gangsta, so gangsta, SO gangsta<br/>
So gangsta, SO gangsta, bye bye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Itchy gitchy ga ga, the shit that get you hotter<br/>
So you won't have to bother or come back yeah baby father<br/>
Best save for dada, unbutton your collar<br/>
Mix the shit yup it's "Tha Doggfather"<br/>
Six-deuce Impala, hip-hop to holler<br/>
Chipped blocked and locked, hits with rottweilers<br/>
Stand out, and van out the week<br/>
I bang out, and hang out the streets<br/>
Push the line of a capo, a don<br/>
Whick-whack niggaz did black folks so wrong<br/>
Peep that out<br/>
Eastside Long Beach, grip that out<br/>
Two times on mine; see I'm a vet on the set<br/>
Steppin my step, where my weapon is kept<br/>
C-rag in my pocket yeah it's still on my left<br/>
I'ma smoke 'til my motherfuckin last breath<br/>
I'm so gangsta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Butch Cassidy]</i><br/>
Are you gangster? They all know<br/>
Hot doe, breaks down do's and kill at shows<br/>
Wanksta - never though<br/>
Let it go, call up hoes, I got the indo<br/>
Boooooom, watch the intellect lose her fear<br/>
Street shit they can't come near<br/>
Let 'em all know that I'm here, no more fears<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
