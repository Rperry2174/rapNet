<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
1998, Dogghouse Records steps on the scene<br/>
Unlike any other record label, we plan to get green<br/>
And keep it clean, and stay oh so mean<br/>
So rough so tough, haha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Suga Free]</i><br/>
What his here? This for them suckas<br/>
Nigga I came from a long line of playas<br/>
that ain't scared of NAR' ONE OF Y'ALL MOTHERFUCKERS!!<br/>
I see these niggas wanna see me catch a case and get struck out<br/>
But I'm laughin', 'bout to knock they ass the fuck out<br/>
Bitch quit actin' like a stuck up clown<br/>
That's why yo raggety-ass attitude is fucked up now<br/>
Suga Freeeeee......hahaha<br/>
Bitch swingin' on my dick sayin WEEEEE!<br/>
The pimpin' is crackin' so I feel like mackin' tonight (aight)<br/>
Now them 70 niggas? 30 gon' hate us<br/>
That's why I play the role, keep control<br/>
and throw them off wit' these dirty gators<br/>
See time was torn<br/>
Cuz if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit<br/>
I bought you somethin too, WHAT'S MINE IS YOURS!<br/>
BUT NOW?! You'd rather bring me down and see me fall<br/>
Walkin' wit my head down straight dependin' on y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
The call me Honcho<br/>
I like to Spark-le<br/>
I'm 'bout to barbecue a bitch like the charcoal<br/>
Am I a star? NO Ya' in my car? NO<br/>
My name is Soopafly, bitch so ya' all know<br/>
Now heffer don't act stupid, cuz y'know who I am<br/>
The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn<br/>
I tell that hoe run, man that hoe better scram<br/>
I pimp across the land<br/>
Better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram<br/>
Snoop Dogg told me that<br/>
Now blow me back while I'm pimpin on this funky track<br/>
Bang E.S. we givin' it up got the bitches singin' the rest<br/>
We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test<br/>
Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest<br/>
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast (so fast)<br/>
Fuck wit' us I'll put a foot up yo ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ruff Dogg]</i><br/>
Collect calls from the pen, so I catch it in the kitchen<br/>
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches<br/>
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jackup<br/>
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up<br/>
We slap hoes that step on toes of our DaDa's<br/>
and ask them niggas in the Source Awards when I caught them<br/>
while y'all was pacin', the homies was bringin' up situations<br/>
Eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop and Kokane]</i><br/>
Dogghouse (woof) in ya mouth (we'll make you go away)<br/>
<i>[Repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga, Dogghouse, this Kurupt bitch, yeah<br/>
<br/>
OK, let the homies spray the K<br/>
Dippin hittin' switches bouncin' over ditches<br/>
Callicodes collapse niggas, perhaps niggas<br/>
Trap or dap and clap niggas, I'M YOUNG GOTTSTRA<br/>
Put it up, pistols might sizzle a nigga<br/>
For shizzle my nigga Kurizzle was nizzle my nigga<br/>
LIke a bitch or a busta, bust a, four fizzle<br/>
surface the air miss wit a homie, wait for the whistle<br/>
Who you thought we was? Temperatures might rise<br/>
Before everybody feel the fire from the 5's<br/>
I told Daz we about to fry niggas like fries<br/>
And seperate them by 5's, and light up the skies<br/>
Crip that D.P., K-U-R-U-P-T<br/>
Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth<br/>
Dogghouse gangstas (woof, woof, woof, woof)<br/>
Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth, ya bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Like this, for the sake of the game<br/>
Bitch nigga jaw-jackin' get ?blasted? out the frame<br/>
Let them punk punk you up<br/>
You jumped up and got stomped the fuck down, what now?<br/>
Showdown, got your three ring circus Bozo's<br/>
cannot work or see the tears of a clown<br/>
Listen nit wit, you can't get wit<br/>
try to sit wit, and get yo shit split quick<br/>
If you wanna say the word is bond<br/>
word is bond, then, I attack like ninja hunter<br/>
You rhyme soft like the other Hunter<br/>
Heather Hunter, fake a gangbang fronter<br/>
Capital D to the O-G-G<br/>
Capital H-O-U-S-E in ya mouth, oh bitch if ya didn't know<br/>
Long Beach City dirty like THE SOUTH!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Lou]</i><br/>
?Wit Suga Free in? I'm in this motherfucker leanin'<br/>
I'm quick to do it umm, meant to do it<br/>
Stayed on my toes like the nigga pimpin', watching the corner<br/>
Much love to my niggas rippin', in California<br/>
Doin it big with my nigga Bad, these niggas mad<br/>
At the 2001 Benz, guzzlin' Henn<br/>
It's Dogghouse and we all in, ballin'<br/>
Goldie got a couple of hoes hoppin' out the Rolls, we chillin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
I came in bangin dub ?minutes? (20 minutes)<br/>
All my niggas know I ain't no motherfucking gimp<br/>
I get down damn, runnin' from damn town<br/>
Dogghouse nigga, Dogg Pound bound<br/>
How you motherfuckers like me now when I do it like<br/>
Bust on the microphone, cuss on the microphone?<br/>
Yeah this nigga like Tracy, Tray Deee<br/>
Bang his ass, slap his ass in the striz-neet<br/>
Catch him wit the headlock, pistol whippin' wit the glock<br/>
Lil' Goldie Loc about to set up shop<br/>
These motherfuckers don't like me anyway<br/>
Shit, I ain't got nothing to say, wit no time to play<br/>
What these motherfuckers thought I was about?<br/>
When I bust this bitch i put my dick in her mouth<br/>
Now all them niggas got something to say<br/>
But I'ma tell 'em Lil' Goldie don't play, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Yeah it's the genius of the click<br/>
Known to sleep a nigga quick<br/>
So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist<br/>
I drew the diagram how to mash the game<br/>
Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs<br/>
From the knuckle shoes buckle when we lock and strap<br/>
I'm a real rider nigga you can drop the act<br/>
I got stripes and bars from a life at war<br/>
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all<br/>
Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks<br/>
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats<br/>
Do or die, to survive from my time of birth<br/>
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse<br/>
It's going down, Dogghouse gangsta style<br/>
And fuck Death Row, we'll take 'em out<br/>
We got the whole rap game bangin' now (C--RIP!!)<br/>
What you motherfuckers think this game's about?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Repeat 8x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mixmaster Spade]</i><br/>
Oh, good evening Topp Dogg I'm so glad you're here<br/>
All the bitches in the front, the gangsters in the rear<br/>
I'm not Dr. Jekyll nor Mr. Hyde<br/>
Whoever told you that, they told you a lie<br/>
You been a waitin' and a waitin', as I can see<br/>
So treat me like the pope and bow to your knees<br/>
Oh the genius on the mic is back again<br/>
So get on the phone and go tell a friend<br/>
I been a waitin' for a while as you all know<br/>
And now I'm back on the mic doggin' the show<br/>
I got platinum 'round my neck, that will never fade<br/>
The name of the chain's Mixmaster Spade<br/>
A sure shot, body rockin'<br/>
A c'mon everybody get ready to rock<br/>
A sure shot, body rockin'<br/>
A c'mon everybody..............<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
