<i>[Hook - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
My weed man got the hook up<br/>
Rollin' up another pound every time you look up<br/>
Big-ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up<br/>
So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups<br/>
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up<br/>
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin' kush ups<br/>
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up<br/>
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin'<br/>
(Don't stop!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Tae Bo, five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Workin' out, chiefin' up, creepin' up, keepin' up<br/>
With the Joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals<br/>
In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it<br/>
Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho<br/>
Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho<br/>
Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob<br/>
Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool<br/>
Cause they know what I got<br/>
I got a bag of the Saturday pot<br/>
And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night<br/>
What do you like?<br/>
When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life<br/>
Now light... the fatty, jump in my Cadi<br/>
Pull your seat back, yup, I know you need that<br/>
Let it flow, set it go, incredible<br/>
That ain't gold, layin' low like 10 to 4, on the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
My weed man got the hook up<br/>
Rollin' up another pound e'rry time you look up<br/>
Big-ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up<br/>
So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups<br/>
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up<br/>
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin' kush ups<br/>
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up<br/>
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin'<br/>
(Don't stop!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Don't even trip<br/>
Ain't really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip<br/>
So much weight you thinkin', “Why this ain't for sale?”<br/>
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails<br/>
She conin' joints, I'm rollin' weed up myself<br/>
Don't ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes<br/>
I heard Polillo 'bout to drop some shit, order those<br/>
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low<br/>
Not too many when I roll, more arms than Goro though<br/>
Boys hatin', I'm just countin' up the money I just made<br/>
And what I'm makin' make a nigga make a million dollars later<br/>
Smokin' <i>[?]</i>, gettin' high pays<br/>
I like my eyes glazed<br/>
Ain't empty out my ashtray in days<br/>
At my house playin' pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats<br/>
I roll a joint, you roll another one next<br/>
Can't even name a nigga colder than<br/>
Ain't pay for game that mean you stole it then<br/>
Know it's the bomb when you hold it in<br/>
<br/>

Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up<br/>
