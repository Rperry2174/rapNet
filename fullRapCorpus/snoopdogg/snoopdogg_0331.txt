<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself<br/>
I roll a motherfucking fat back to myself<br/>
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her<br/>
Til she finally did it<br/>
Overworked but I'm still committed<br/>
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it<br/>
Gracefully gazing unto the sky<br/>
A lot of people smoke just to get by<br/>
But I see things much differently<br/>
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically<br/>
Put it in a letter so you let it be<br/>
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree<br/>
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J<br/>
And not have to answer to nobody<br/>
I live my life like it's a party<br/>
So let's go cuz<br/>
<br/>
So go ahead and blaze up<br/>
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)<br/>
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Devin The Dude:]</i><br/>
I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep<br/>
I got me a sweet<br/>
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police<br/>
You think you could smoke like my &amp; Snoop, don't try to compete<br/>
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up<br/>
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up<br/>
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity<br/>
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me<br/>
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe<br/>
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so<br/>
Then I got plenty of flowers to blow<br/>
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong<br/>
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song<br/>
And do it however you please, you please<br/>
Today's the day to smoke weed<br/>
<br/>
So go ahead and blaze up<br/>
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)<br/>
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now<br/>
Remember smoking with my cousin<br/>
Now we all Raw cone stuffing<br/>
Enough to wake neighbors up<br/>
KK my favorite flavor<br/>
And you ain't gotta ask cause we major<br/>
I smoke like them old players<br/>
Only put it in the paper<br/>
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me<br/>
Known to keep the room cloudy<br/>
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open<br/>
The best trees I be smoking<br/>
Smell it through the bag so it's potent<br/>
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice<br/>
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it<br/>
A pothead but I be focused<br/>
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit<br/>
Only the best what you dealing with<br/>
It's legal now, everybody's doing this<br/>
<br/>
So go ahead and blaze up<br/>
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)<br/>
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana<br/>
Go ahead and blaze up<br/>
Today's the day to blaze up<br/>
So go ahead and put your J's up<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na<br/>
<br/>
Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight
