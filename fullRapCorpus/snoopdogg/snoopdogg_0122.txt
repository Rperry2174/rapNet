<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Snooooooooooop..<br/>
Snooooooooooop..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
When the pimp's in the crib ma<br/>
Drop it like it's hot<br/>
Drop it like it's hot<br/>
Drop it like it's hot<br/>
When the pigs try to get at ya<br/>
Park it like it's hot<br/>
Park it like it's hot<br/>
Park it like it's hot<br/>
And if a nigga get a attitude<br/>
Pop it like it's hot<br/>
Pop it like it's hot<br/>
Pop it like it's hot<br/>
I got the rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon<br/>
And I roll the best weed cause I got it going on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Pharrell Williams]</i><br/>
Uh! I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams<br/>
See these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?<br/>
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat<br/>
That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat<br/>
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs<br/>
The interior like suicide wrist red<br/>
I can excercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed<br/>
Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead<br/>
Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street<br/>
Wit the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat<br/>
So don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy shit<br/>
Trying to ask me shit<br/>
When my niggaz fill ya vest they ain't gon pass me shit<br/>
You should think about it, take a second<br/>
Matter fact, you should take four B<br/>
And think before you fuck wit lil skateboard P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that<br/>
Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah I had to do that<br/>
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside<br/>
But only on the left side, yeah that's the Crip side<br/>
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play<br/>
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ<br/>
<i>[scratches]</i> "two!" - "one!" - "yep, three!"<br/>
S-N double O-P, D-O double G<br/>
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it<br/>
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked<br/>
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside<br/>
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!<br/>
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little<br/>
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles<br/>
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle<br/>
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm a Bad Boy, wit a lotta ho's<br/>
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes<br/>
I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp<br/>
On the TV screen and in the magazines<br/>
If you play me close, you're on a red beam<br/>
Oh you got a gun so you wanna pop back?<br/>
AK47 now nigga, stop that!<br/>
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move<br/>
Your family's crying, now you on the news<br/>
They can't find you, and now they miss you<br/>
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you<br/>
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you<br/>
Then dance to this motherfucking music we crip to<br/>
Subscribe nigga, get yo issue<br/>
Baby come close, let me see how you get loose!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Snooooooooooop.<br/>
Snooooooooooop..
