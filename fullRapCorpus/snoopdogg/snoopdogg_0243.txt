<i>[Snoop Lion &amp; Cori B:]</i><br/>
Money makes a man and that's a crime<br/>
If we all were rich, we'd spend more time<br/>
With our daughters and sons, they're losing their minds<br/>
We all feel hurt, here's mine, hear me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Cori B]</i><br/>
Cause, no guns are allowed, in here tonight<br/>
We're gonna have a free for all, no fights<br/>
I wanna get lost in the crowd, in here tonight<br/>
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
Let the music play, me don't want no more gunplay<br/>
When the bodies hit the ground, there's nothing left to say, ay, ay<br/>
Me don't want to see no more innocent blood shed<br/>
Me don't want to see no more youth dead<br/>
Come hear me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Cori B]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home<br/>
This when it hurts to be gone<br/>
Two more young names to be carved out of stone<br/>
One summer day that went horribly wrong<br/>
Got my dawg on the phone<br/>
Crying and saying to leave him alone, but I'm not leaving his side<br/>
I know that somebody died, somebody's child<br/>
Some people ducked down and some people hide<br/>
Some people just cannot react in time<br/>
Bullets do not choose a victim<br/>
It is the shooter that picks them<br/>
They just can't wait to get you in the system<br/>
The district attorney could use a conviction<br/>
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen<br/>
Life is so heavy with that on your soul<br/>
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh<br/>
And pour something out for the lives that they stole<br/>
416<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Cori B]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Lion &amp; Cori B:]</i><br/>
Money makes a man and that's a crime<br/>
Money makes a man and that's a crime<br/>
I wanna get lost in the crowd, in here tonight
