Ayo Snoop Dogg<br/>
Yea<br/>
I got a question for you<br/>
Hm?<br/>
I wanna ask the question why<br/>
Why?<br/>
Do you do the thing that you do?<br/>
Shabba<br/>
And how you keep on doin the things that you do<br/>
What I do?<br/>
Yea<br/>
Tell a nigga<br/>
You ain't know?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Don't stop keepin it on and on<br/>
What do you see?<br/>
Something like a phenomenon<br/>
Baby what'll it be?<br/>
Hey girl<br/>
(Hey girl you know I'm talkin to you over there, come on over)<br/>
Yea, you know I got that shit<br/>
(You know we got that shit, go on and blaze up)<br/>
Don't trip<br/>
If you ain't bout this shit<br/>
(If you ain't bout it, don't be about it)<br/>
Nigga tell em who I am<br/>
<br/>
You the muthafuckin man dawg, that shit ain't hard to see<br/>
And what you do on the daily what them other fools try to be<br/>
Ain't comparison, Adidas yea we bearin em<br/>
Smoking on that medicine<br/>
Tell them muthafuckas let us in<br/>
<br/>
Ayo the partys packed from the body to wall<br/>
This is what I need from ya'll<br/>
Put your hands up in the air<br/>
Put your hands up in the air<br/>

<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Imma give it to ya, Imma show ya what that business is<br/>
Imma give it to you like that<br/>
Imma give it to ya, Imma show ya what that business is<br/>
Imma give it to you like that<br/>
What you gon do for me? What you gon do for her?<br/>
What you gon do for him? What you gon do for them?<br/>

<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Don't stop keepin it on and on<br/>
What do you see?<br/>
Something like a phenomenon<br/>
Baby what'll it be?<br/>
Hey girl<br/>
Yea, you know I got that shit<br/>
Don't trip<br/>
If you ain't bout this shit<br/>

<i>[Daz Dillinger:]</i><br/>
When I was a little baby boy<br/>
My mama gave me a brand new toy<br/>
Two turn tables with the mix and I learned to rhyme like a dolomite<br/>
Time went by in a fly creation<br/>
I knew someday I would rock the nation<br/>
So I made up my mind just what to do<br/>
Put on some gray and blue and made my own crew<br/>
<br/>
And since you dig, your shit on hit and this is how we rock<br/>
I chitty bang my city man and this is for the block<br/>
Equipped to hit, I get you whipped and spit that shit you like<br/>
I'm on like superfly tonight<br/>
Cus I don't have no kryptonite<br/>
<br/>
