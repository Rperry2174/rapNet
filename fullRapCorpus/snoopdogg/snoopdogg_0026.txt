All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge<br/>
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college<br/>
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene<br/>
Watch the gangsta haters close cos they worse than dope fiends<br/>
I hope things get better for you<br/>
cos I'ma make things get better for me<br/>
and keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB<br/>
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea<br/>
We ride at high tide, the East is my side<br/>
I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable<br/>
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible<br/>
Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence<br/>
Wit persistence I perceive<br/>
to supply you wit what you need, no room for greed<br/>
Better go around and when it come to you<br/>
don't bite off more than you can chew<br/>
Respect the game and the game will respect you back<br/>
Game is life, life is struggle<br/>
without the coastal juggle<br/>
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal<br/>
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)<br/>
or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces<br/>
and put it back together and remain tougher than leather<br/>
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg<br/>
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Just keep it real Dogg<br/>
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all<br/>
<i>[repeat x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Teatlet?, hold em, shake em, roll<br/>
Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls<br/>
Pound puts it down all around the world<br/>
But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga<br/>
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark<br/>
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?<br/>
On the microphone I bury the bone<br/>
Always, strays try to follow me home<br/>
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin doo-doo<br/>
I'm steppin on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe<br/>
See I'm smashin full-breaded wit no leash<br/>
When I mob, make marks across the street<br/>
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail<br/>
for the bow-wow LBC style<br/>
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper<br/>
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever<br/>
I want em close enough so I can lock on em<br/>
wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em<br/>
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em<br/>
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, uhh<br/>
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?<br/>
Major trick we're hittin licks like a doberman gang<br/>
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy<br/>
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all<br/>
Just keep it real Dogg<br/>
<i>[repeat x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs<br/>
where it's all about dope and pistol smoke<br/>
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver<br/>
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out<br/>
Oh, did you not know<br/>
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door<br/>
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses<br/>
Knockin niggas llike cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin<br/>
It's like in a action<br/>
cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin<br/>
Bustin, no need for discussion<br/>
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust<br/>
close enough to touch then rush<br/>
Clean and radical and get clutch<br/>
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone<br/>
for the D-O-double G (with the solid gold rhyme)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Just keep it real Dogg<br/>
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all<br/>
<i>[repeat x3]</i>
