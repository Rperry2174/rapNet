<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Stacey Boots, perms and suits, I'm braided up, can fade it up<br/>
I skated up, you waited up, so you know I got to go ahead and tear shit up<br/>
Turn lose on these muthafuckers Jelly Roll<br/>
Nephew, boy this shit is out of control<br/>
Rockin, rollin, bangin b<br/>
A little something, something nigga, thats banged up streets<br/>
Freak, freak yall, into the beat ya'll<br/>
And to all my big doggs grab your meat cha'll<br/>
And yes, yes ya'll, oh we the best ya'll<br/>
We got the shit that make the bitches grab they breast ya'll<br/>
It don't stop till the wheels fall off<br/>
954 headed swervin in the goodin clinic, tryin keep it hot right<br/>
Fuckers spot light, my nigga Jelly Roll make it knock light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We all shinin' stars<br/>
Ya'll know who you are<br/>
And dip low lows with me<br/>
You party with a D.P.G.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
We ridin, dippin, slippin, slidin, eastside up eastsiders<br/>
Riders, ballers, rollers, ladies, <br/>
players, gangstas, macks, pimps, and 'llacs<br/>
Hustlers, bitches, niggas and G's, we having big thangs blowing trees<br/>
Shinin, grinin, refuse to lose<br/>
I gotta a G in my pocket for dippin out of shoes<br/>
I head the corner in the Navigator<br/>
Committed to excellence like a Raider<br/>
You hate a nigga like me but you got to love me<br/>
Your lady wanna shove me and your kids wanna hug me<br/>
A nigga fuckin like Buggsy Seagal again, I'm in the ringle again<br/>
I do it all legal again, I can't lose you won't win, respect the boss<br/>
If you run up, you gettin done up, I love to floss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Why you acting bad, probably cause I'm know as the bad actor<br/>
In the rap game I'm the big factor, macker, smack a bitch in a second<br/>
The big dogg nigga very well respected<br/>
You gotta put your mash down when you wanna get to the top<br/>
The game is stuffy like Puffy don't stop<br/>
I thought I told ya, nigga I'm a soldier<br/>
No Limit Lieutenant, yeah I did it<br/>
I'm committed like a motherfucker supposed to be<br/>
Won't let no bitch niggaz close to me<br/>
From my head to my feet I'm protected from harm<br/>
Cause I'm a muthafucking shining star, you feel me<br/>
And fuck who wanna kill me<br/>
you niggaz thrill me, but guess what will be<br/>
On top tip top, non stop, dogg not<br/>
And you gotta let me end, the nigga I'm a shine like a G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
