Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence, for the small chronic break?<br/>
A-hah, niggaz be brown-nosing these hoes and shit.<br/>
Takin bitches out to eat, and spendin money on these hoes, knowhatI'msayin?<br/>
I treat a bitch like 7-Up I never have I never well<br/>
I tell a bitch like this<br/>
Bitch, you without me is like Harry Melvin without Bluenotes<br/>
You'll never go platinum<br/>
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga
