<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Brothers is wack by popular demand<br/>
Chasin fame and girls livin they life on cruise control<br/>
But tell me; what do it profit a man<br/>
to gain a whole world livin trife but then lose his soul?<br/>
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin<br/>
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin<br/>
Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free<br/>
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stevie Wonder]</i><br/>
It's no better people who have left the problems of today<br/>
Leavin to conclude that for their life is not the way<br/>
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find<br/>
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind<br/>
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd<br/>
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood<br/>
Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed<br/>
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong<br/>
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have<br/>
As God blessed the child that can go get his own<br/>
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip<br/>
Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins<br/>
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich<br/>
But to them they can endure to the end and win<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stevie Wonder]</i><br/>
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd<br/>
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood... yeahhhheyyyy<br/>
<i>[scatting to a harmonica]</i><br/>
Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world<br/>
Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls<br/>
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd<br/>
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run<br/>
With God, man ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stevie Wonder]</i><br/>
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd<br/>
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You're so frustrated, worryin 'bout your bread<br/>
And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stevie Wonder]</i><br/>
When you lose too much too baaaaaaad<br/>
Just go talk to God and prayyyyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
And you's a good women, but you can't understand<br/>
why it seems like you ain't never gon' find yourself a good man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stevie Wonder]</i><br/>
When you feel your life's too HARRR-ARRRRRD<br/>
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Mothers on welfare or ladies that's strippin<br/>
You under so much pressure, feel like your sanity's slippin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stevie Wonder]</i><br/>
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd!<br/>
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood, hmmm<br/>
He'll never never let you down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[S.W.]</i> You know that, don't you Snoop?<br/>
<i>[Dogg]</i> You know I know it Uncle Steven<br/>
<i>[S.W.]</i> Oh I know that too, we know it<br/>
<i>[Dogg]</i> Yeah we do<br/>
<i>[S.W.]</i> Thanks a lot man<br/>
<i>[Dogg]</i> Nah thank you man I appreciate that, you know I love you<br/>
<i>[S.W.]</i> And I love you for what you sayin<br/>
<i>[Dogg]</i> God bless you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
And you can catch me down on my knees, askin the Lord please<br/>
Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease<br/>
There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression<br/>
I'm askin for your protection and thanking you for your blessing<br/>
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll<br/>
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal<br/>
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much<br/>
Now that's tabernacle, chuuuch!
