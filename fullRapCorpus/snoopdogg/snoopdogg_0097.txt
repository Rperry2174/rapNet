<i>[Mac Minista]</i><br/>
There's a scripture in the Mac Bible that says<br/>
'He that trusts a ho, shall surely be broke'<br/>
'Pressure busts a pipe that make water run uphill'<br/>
Alotta you niggas talk that shit<br/>
But half you niggas ain't real<br/>
Will the real niggas stand up and be counted<br/>
Or lay down and be mounted<br/>
Cuz this game is not a playground, it's a classroom<br/>
It's not a holiday, but an educational process<br/>
And experience is your greatest teacher<br/>
So listen to the gangsta mack preacher<br/>
Macks do what they want, bustas do the best that they can<br/>
From half of a gangstas start, is a sucka's dream<br/>
In the game God said, that he would send a G<br/>
With the street ethnics and G-Code<br/>
With the gangsta Ten Commandments<br/>
And the gangsta Ten Commandments shall read:<br/>
'Thou shall kill a snitch'<br/>
'Thou shall check a bitch'<br/>
'Thou shall charge a ho'<br/>
'Thou shall send a sucker'<br/>
'Thou shall respect the G'<br/>
'Thou shall pack that steel'<br/>
'Thou shall keep it real'<br/>
'Thou shall flex his G's'<br/>
'Thou shall stack his green'<br/>
'Thou shall stay true to his game'<br/>
See I'm a gangsta, not a prankster<br/>
I don't pull rabbits out of my hat<br/>
But I will pull a strap from behind my back<br/>
Now how 'bout that!
