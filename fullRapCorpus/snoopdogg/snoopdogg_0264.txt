<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Groove thang, groove thang, groove thang...<br/>
Yeah, cause I be rockin' my two chains<br/>
And I do things, and I do things...<br/>
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang<br/>
My groove thang, my groove thang...<br/>
Yeah, just watch me now in my groove thang...<br/>
My groove thang, my groove thang...<br/>
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang<br/>
Yeah, just watch me now...<br/>
<br/>
Too hippy to be cut-throat - hippies blow the best smoke<br/>
Rollin' up RAWs and living royal<br/>
All my and bays &amp; jays is loyal, they won't leave me cause I spoil<br/>
The baddest of them all, the hash is why I won't fall<br/>
Molasses can't match my crawl, I'm higher than all of y'all<br/>
They sayin' they born to ball, I'm sayin' I'm Santa Claus<br/>
Funny jokes I tell all, always inhale fog<br/>
Nappy dreads, my hair long - Diamond 5-foot bong<br/>
Could never be a clone...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's a new thang and a new look<br/>
Kids be makin' our names in the book<br/>
Who you wanna be when you grow up?<br/>
The Broadus Boyz, we actin' up<br/>
We showin' out and we show up<br/>
We ballin', it's all we know, it's not an option<br/>
You see us, and yes, we poppin'<br/>
Standin' tall, we not fallin'<br/>
On top, and yes, we callin' shots<br/>
What you thought? I'm in charge and I'm the boss<br/>
Do a show and then we shop for the flyest gear<br/>
We up in here, dippin' and dodging, man, changing gears<br/>
This the life we chose, so you gon' hear this all year<br/>
<br/>
