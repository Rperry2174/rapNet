I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey<br/>
<br/>
Overzel me, propel me, propeller, cat pilla,<br/>
Rap healer, dope dealer, grip it back<br/>
Look it back now, reseller,<br/>
Exhale, inhaler, feller, Juicys pored<br/>
Dueces for all you loud mouth bitches who adore<br/>
I can't play on your field anymore<br/>
Take it flight, now look at me soar<br/>
In and out of space with my foot to the floor<br/>
Higher and higher, I won't retire<br/>
Halfie don Kaya, Love smokin fire tata like satellite,<br/>
All on the wire,<br/>
Keep it up, speed it up, slow it up<br/>
Throw it up<br/>
Your bitch is looking at me cause she probably wanna go with us<br/>
It's cool with me, hop in, hop in, ain't no stopping<br/>
We keep knocking, rocking<br/>
<br/>
I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey<br/>
<br/>
Dimes, dubs, quarter ounce oz, put it in a zag<br/>
Let it burn slowly everywhere I am<br/>
Nigga got a blow tree rolling every gram<br/>
They be like holy smokes, that man no joke<br/>
Can tell if it's that "mehh" (crap) if you don't choke<br/>
Never gonna quit, every chance I'm a toke<br/>
Zips smelling like the whole plants in my coat<br/>
For autographs, coming at me with all the names<br/>
And what I gotta have<br/>
I got my own shit, and this ain't for the little kid<br/>
This grown shit, having a party at my crib<br/>
Bring your own bitch, I got 3, so matter of fact you can take one<br/>
And roll a joint baby girl let's bake one<br/>
And take this weed and I can show you how to make one, ah<br/>
<br/>
I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Niggas know I get lifted it's high school, I stay high, I mean I don't gotta get high I'm already there, yeah, I was high when I said that, haha, whatup snoop!<br/>
<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey<br/>
<br/>
I'm just soaking up the breeze, smoking on some trees<br/>
I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees<br/>
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need<br/>
I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees<br/>
<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, I get lifted, everyday<br/>
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey
