<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i> <br/>
One, two, three and to the heat<br/>
Stop countin sheep and move your feet to the beat<br/>
I bet you're wonderin, "Who are you?"<br/>
The baker who made new Hot Pockets come true<br/>
Now let me give you, an introduction<br/>
to the Master Baker of this production<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bow Wow]</i><br/>
Yeah, you know he bakes here, you know he bakes there<br/>
He be baking all day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I bake err'ywhere<br/>
Wanna bake with me? Then come on in<br/>
We light up taste buds (From beginning to end)<br/>
My buttery seasoning so hip, it drips<br/>
Tastes so good, gotta lick your lips<br/>
Smell my savory garlic, but don't disturb<br/>
The garden where I grow, flavor-fantastic-al HERBS<br/>
(Yeah, his flavor-fantastical herbs, y'know!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Biz Markie]</i><br/>
YOU... You got what I eeeeeaaat!<br/>
Now say you're just a baker<br/>
But you're my Hot Pockets maker<br/>
OH BABY YOU... got what I eeeeeaaat!<br/>
You got the hot buttery crust<br/>
I need your hot buttery crust, OHH!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[KevJumba]</i><br/>
Hold up, hold up, my friend's got a (beef) with you<br/>
Take a step back baker, The Butcher's coming through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Oliver Cooper (KevJumba)]</i><br/>
I see you like that crust, well I like it too<br/>
But without my premium meats, you got nothing to chew<br/>
See I'm the Master Butcher and I bow down to zero<br/>
Online, they call me the 8-Bit hero<br/>
I fly cross the land so my flocks are protected<br/>
Try to come for my beef and you gonna get rejected<br/>
Cause when you step to me, you gonna get stuck<br/>
As your head takes a buck from pepperoni nun-chucks<br/>
(He's got premium meats, the cream of the crop)<br/>
Welcome to my B-I-Double G Butcher Shop, ya hearrrd?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Biz Markie]</i><br/>
YOU... You got what I eeeeeaaat!<br/>
You make the Steak and Cheese<br/>
That brings me to my knees<br/>
OH BABY YOU... got what I eeeeeaaat!<br/>
The flavor is so sweet<br/>
You know how to spice that meat<br/>
..errrAUGH!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg (Bow Wow)]</i><br/>
Now I know The Butcher likes to take credit for the show<br/>
But there's a reason that my bakery is rollin in the dough<br/>
Listen lil' baby, don't fall for the cuts<br/>
(It's the buttery crust that makes you want so much)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Oliver Cooper (KevJumba)]</i><br/>
Don't listen to him, girl - he's been baking too long<br/>
It's my premium meats that make your lips sing a song<br/>
(When that sauce heats up, the pepperonis do the rest)<br/>
It's exactly why my new Hot Pockets are the best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Biz Markie]</i><br/>
No, no, no YOU... both got what I eeeeeaaat!<br/>
I love your buttery crust<br/>
But I love that meat just as much<br/>
OH BABY YOU... both got what I eeeeeaaat!<br/>
You got all my hot treats<br/>
You both make me complete<br/>
OH BAAA-BAAAAAAAAYYYYEEE!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Larry King]</i><br/>
Hello, hello, gentlemen, have you forgotten about, the CHEESE?<br/>
HELLO! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!
