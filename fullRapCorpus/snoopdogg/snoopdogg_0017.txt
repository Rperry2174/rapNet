I put down more hits than mafioso made<br/>
And Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano<br/>
And I know, I know the way you feel<br/>
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real<br/>
Just to get you caught up in amazement<br/>
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous<br/>
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack<br/>
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha<br/>
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan<br/>
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo, <br/>
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes<br/>
Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's<br/>
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga<br/>
I'm Tha DoggFather<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)<br/>
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)<br/>
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance<br/>
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance<br/>
I'm so fly like a dove<br/>
I come from up above<br/>
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love<br/>
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em<br/>
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom<br/>
I delete em, but don't mistreat em<br/>
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on, <br/>
Let me flow on<br/>
You can rock to tha rythme you see <br/>
or you can rock to tha rythme of me<br/>
Just remember when you do your thang,<br/>
Make sure you do your thang on a hang<br/>
And everythang, is everythang<br/>
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase<br/>
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case<br/>
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,<br/>
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost<br/>
I'm Tha DoggFather<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now, do anybody in tha house remember<br/>
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)<br/>
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC<br/>
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)<br/>
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop<br/>
Have prestigious women <br/>
That's the truth from the begining<br/>
In and out of the flyest hotels<br/>
You say your family don't know me<br/>
Hold on hommie, that's formost and promos<br/>
Sales, tails, scales and jails<br/>
Success before death<br/>
No one in my clique fails<br/>
As females with the almighty Father lead<br/>
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need<br/>
And it ain't no party like this kind, <br/>
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind<br/>
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind<br/>
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and<br/>
I'm tha DoggFather<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Repeat until fade out)]</i>
