Quick draw - I'm fast on my heat<br/>
Buckle up and take a ride in my passenger seat<br/>
Put your feet to the pavement, look at my behavement<br/>
See how, the be how, and trip what I was raised with<br/>
Can't no nigga fade me, bangin' like the 80s<br/>
Had a lot of money with a handful of babies<br/>
Boy, this shit is crazy - straight from the turf<br/>
Hit the red alert and ask Mack it better work<br/>
So I slide to the spizot, right behind the lizide<br/>
And get a bag of pizot, avoid getting hizocked<br/>
Cause hizabs is on me, they want me, but I can't fold<br/>
I'm an Eastside rider, I was born to roll<br/>
Never tell to be told, never sell to be sold<br/>
On the level, what a rebel, boy, I stay in control<br/>
And I'mma let you ride with me so you can see how it goes<br/>
And we'll hit the track and let you peep out some hoes<br/>
And if you like what you see, and you agree with me<br/>
Then you enjoy my perspective of the LBC<br/>
Kick back and roll up, and mix the Henny with the soda<br/>
We ridin' like we flyin' through the system of solar<br/>
And the aroma of doja, the atmospherin' we hearin'<br/>
Since I'm the driver I'm ridin' with rear-end super suspension<br/>
The misson can't be completed 'til you get that vibe<br/>
Now you're mobbin' to the beat on the passenger side<br/>
<br/>
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go<br/>
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow<br/>
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go<br/>
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow<br/>
<br/>
We in the tre, so I'mma dip it slow<br/>
Next stop is the liquor store<br/>
Last sip, pour it back<br/>
So good, I had to get some more of that<br/>
Yeah. And now we on tizilt<br/>
Interior, mizilk - exterior, sizilk<br/>
Okay, okay, alright - say it like all day<br/>
In the tre with the dawgs, that's the player life<br/>
How you feel now?<br/>
I know - you probably want the wheel now<br/>
But I can't and I ain't, so just roll up some more of that dank<br/>
And pour some more of that drank<br/>
And hand me that CD so I can let the shit knock<br/>
Live in the drop<br/>
You can hear it when we comin', we speedin' up the block<br/>
While we're beatin' up the block, it's 'bout to go down<br/>
Slip-sliding, rip-riding with my broham, haha<br/>
<br/>
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go<br/>
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow<br/>
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go<br/>
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow<br/>
<br/>
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go<br/>
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow<br/>
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go<br/>
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow
