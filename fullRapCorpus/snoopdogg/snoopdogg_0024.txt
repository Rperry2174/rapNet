Can you feel it, nothing can save ya<br/>
For this is the season of catching the vapors<br/>
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do<br/>
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew<br/>
What you want on Nate Dogg<br/>
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'<br/>
'Ain't No Fun', now check it<br/>
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it<br/>
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam<br/>
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear<br/>
She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair<br/>
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess<br/>
Talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress<br/>
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer<br/>
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her<br/>
But now he wear boots that match with his suits<br/>
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap<br/>
And now she stop flautin and won't it speakin<br/>
Be comin round the Pound every single weekend<br/>
to get his beeper number she be beggin please<br/>
Dyin for the day to eat these<br/>
<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
She caught the vapors<br/>
<br/>
I got a little cousin that's kinda plain<br/>
He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang<br/>
A mellow type of fellow best laid back<br/>
But back in the day he wasn't nuthin like that<br/>
I remember when he used to scrap every day<br/>
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey<br/>
He wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied<br/>
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside<br/>
Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad<br/>
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had<br/>
They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta<br/>
Or be there in jail or some other shaker<br/>
But now he's grown up to be a surprise<br/>
D-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide<br/>
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child<br/>
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle<br/>
<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
They caught the vapors<br/>
<br/>
I got another homie from tha L-B-C<br/>
Known ta yall as D.J. Warren G<br/>
He cut grass trasform wit finesse<br/>
......... and all that mess<br/>
I remember when we first started to rap<br/>
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop<br/>
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said<br/>
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted<br/>
Now my homie Warren still tried<br/>
On and on and on til the like break of dawn<br/>
To work at tha V-I-P would be the link<br/>
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip<br/>
Now for the year after Regulate<br/>
Warren G is havin papers so my homies write straight<br/>
He walked into the same record shop as before<br/>
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store<br/>
Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it<br/>
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren<br/>
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't<br/>
Now guess what they call sessy bussin<br/>
<br/>
the vapors<br/>
They caught vapors<br/>
I got to talk bout me now<br/>
<br/>
Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg<br/>
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog<br/>
When I was a teenager I tried to be down<br/>
And since they wasn't tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound<br/>
I saw a crew on 2-1 street<br/>
and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said<br/>
no, and treated me like a wet food stamp<br/>
after gettin rejected, I ain't runnin upset<br/>
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?'  Rhymes at rates<br/>
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait<br/>
What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight<br/>
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music<br/>
They acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi<br/>
But now things switched from West to East<br/>
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?<br/>
'We used to see Daz, back in the day'<br/>
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed<br/>
<br/>
You caught the vapors<br/>
You caught the vapors<br/>
You got the papers
