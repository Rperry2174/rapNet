Yeah, this record's for my baby, my baby boo<br/>
I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone<br/>
And you say I'll never make records for you no more<br/>
Well this record is from me to you baby<br/>
Yeah, real talk<br/>
<br/>
Been around tha world<br/>
I've been into many places seen some unfamiliar faces<br/>
But baby none of them compares to you<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone<br/>
<br/>
I seen everything twice<br/>
Been around tha world, I've seen every scene twice<br/>
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice<br/>
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice<br/>
<br/>
I do it big, fuck the rumors<br/>
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas<br/>
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami<br/>
I did all that, I was voted ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorta like Sammy<br/>
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy<br/>
Sipping Chardinae, making deals on my hands free<br/>
Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me<br/>
'Cause I own rap and I'm coming for your day job<br/>
<br/>
Until then I'm chilling at the day spa<br/>
Relax my mind and just chill<br/>
'Cause without you none of this is real<br/>
Baby you know I<br/>
<br/>
Been around tha world<br/>
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces<br/>
But baby none of them compares to you<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but now I'm back across the water<br/>
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter<br/>
Blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell<br/>
By my rag hanging, fuck this is Crip, but I'm chilling<br/>
<br/>
It feels so good to get away<br/>
Especially when your name is D O double Gizzee<br/>
Coast to coast jetting, man I been doing that<br/>
What's up, just start balling ... I been around the track<br/>
<br/>
Hop in Peas with the bosses<br/>
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office<br/>
Docking down in Monaco, churching with my folks<br/>
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat<br/>
<br/>
My life is like a movie<br/>
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me<br/>
Then I relax and chill<br/>
'Cause without you none of this is real<br/>
Baby you know I<br/>
<br/>
Been around tha world<br/>
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces<br/>
But baby none of them compares to you<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone<br/>
<br/>
Been around tha world<br/>
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces<br/>
But baby none of them compares to you<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone<br/>
<br/>
Just for you baby<br/>
Yeah, I'm on my way home right now<br/>
I'm on my way right now<br/>
I'm leaving the studio right now<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, soon as I get home tomorrow I'ma go unplug it<br/>
Matter of fact I ain't even gonna bring it in the house<br/>
See you in a minute
