<i>[Hook - 2x : Ric Rock]</i><br/>
Sticky fingers is the one I love<br/>
I love him, I love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Mmm, mmm, mmm<br/>
Sometimes I just look at how you buy me things <br/>
Before I split you wide open and I take a whif<br/>
You so fine and now that you mind, it's that time<br/>
I'm holdin' on you close, can't wait to be kind<br/>
Slowly dig you out and spread you 'cross the sheet<br/>
Run my fingers through your hair, 'til you soft and sweet<br/>
As you clingin' to my fingers, time to get you hot<br/>
Wrap you up real tight, then I lick the top<br/>
Got you properly positioned to consume you whole<br/>
But I know as we together I'ma lose control<br/>
Any way I spark the flame and the games commence<br/>
As your aroma take over I get faded quick<br/>
See you fill me with a feeling so fulfilling it's thrillin'<br/>
That without you it's about to be a reason for livin'<br/>
I spend my last cash, even chose to fight<br/>
But yet I would even share if the mood is right<br/>
Let's get high<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Where my grinder at?<br/>
Where my grinder at?<br/>
So I can breakdown some Colombian black<br/>
Can't find my tire, so I use my 'tibs<br/>
Twist it up in some chocolate, now hit this shit<br/>
... And hold it in for about 20 seconds<br/>
Now how the hell you'd get "Mary Jane" naked?<br/>
Watch me light the cigarette up, I bet it burn out<br/>
Now hit some of this shit nigga, it get you turned out<br/>
Make you wanna jump back and kiss ya'self<br/>
Solo blunt to the neck, I don't need no help<br/>
But if I run to a bad bats, it's just anotha dollar loss<br/>
In time to pop my coller, 'til I pop a coller off<br/>
Situation sticky, no need for being picky<br/>
Don't touch ya face, the crystals make you itchy<br/>
Who's the theif that stole ya keef?<br/>
I had to smash on the teeth, right down the streets<br/>
You know why?<br/>
