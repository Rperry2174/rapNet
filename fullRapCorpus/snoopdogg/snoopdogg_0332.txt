My dawgs don't bark, but they get off<br/>
Fuck around and get your whole face bit off<br/>
Sinister, spit truth like a minister<br/>
So until I'm a monster, when it's the right time<br/>
Night time, nigga tryna creep<br/>
And keep from dyin' in these motherfuckin' streets<br/>
Fuck the police, from a black man's point of view<br/>
Spray that shit, say that shit<br/>
We right in front of you, each and every one of you<br/>
I'm not gon' tell y'all niggas what we gonna do<br/>
But whatever y'all did, put two on it<br/>
And put a foot on your neck with a shoe on it<br/>
Resident evil, it's all on camera and they still don't believe you<br/>
Clownin' around, don't come your clown ass 'round here<br/>
Nigga you gon' get down<br/>
Real talk, I'm leavin' all you clown ass niggas outlined in chalk<br/>
Stay black, payback from way back<br/>
I'm the homie, 'but the motherfuckin' homie don't play that<br/>
<br/>
And the night will fall, this is death to you all<br/>
When the nighttime falls, this the final call<br/>
This the final call, call, call<br/>
<br/>
The final call, see reparations will be tooken<br/>
Now it ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun, ha<br/>
Motherfuckers, trip this<br/>
<br/>
Cut them motherfuckers off the leash<br/>
It's been a week since my dogs ate, let 'em eat<br/>
See I'ma tell you upfront and uncut<br/>
See I'm a stand up nigga, I'm a man up nigga<br/>
Get what I gotta get, a bitch nigga gon' talk a whole lot of shit<br/>
Which is the main reason why you stuck around<br/>
And I don't fuck around<br/>
I'm blowin' new purple in a new circle<br/>
I don't wanna hurt you but I will spurt you<br/>
And send you back to the earth, you<br/>
Came from, game gun<br/>
Same one, that I used in another galaxy<br/>
Actually, it's all fact to me<br/>
If I ruled the world would it come back to me?<br/>
Black to me, with my hand on that thang thang<br/>
I'm from the home of the brave, land of the gang bang<br/>
<br/>
And the night will fall, this is death to you all<br/>
When the nighttime falls, this the final call<br/>
This the final call, call, call
