<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<i>[Brandy:]</i><br/>
It's the way you,<br/>
It's the way you make me feel<br/>
(Special girl, you're so special, special)<br/>
Baby just don't change, you're so real<br/>
(so special girl you're so special, special)<br/>
Show me that I'm special, tell me boy<br/>
<i>[Pharrell:]</i><br/>
Girl you know you are special<br/>
I bet you were born in the sky.<br/>
<i>[Brandy:]</i><br/>
Show me that I'm special, tell me boy<br/>
<i>[Pharrell:]</i><br/>
Girl, you know you are special, girl<br/>
The hottest in my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I know you, and you know me<br/>
And this is the place that you really wan' be<br/>
Let's make it crack-a-lack I make it look easy<br/>
Life can be a carnival and I'm a be your reason<br/>
Kiss me slowly,<br/>
Perform quiet storm til I get you nice-ly<br/>
I'm puttin out the blunt cause I see<br/>
I see that I need you more in my life<br/>
Than I need a bag of weed.<br/>
Now I compare you to a bird<br/>
When she fly by<br/>
I wanna rock you back to sleep<br/>
Like beddy-bye-bye.<br/>
Bounce in the 'lac<br/>
With your hand on my leg<br/>
Throw your bags in the back<br/>
I'm a show you where it's at<br/>
No telling if we might come back<br/>
You like that?<br/>
I figgerd out a way to catch a flight right back<br/>
See I ain't never flown for fees<br/>
Come spend a weekend overseas in greece with me<br/>
Please believe<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You know, if you're through with me<br/>
Then I'm through with you<br/>
But you're the one who fell in love<br/>
And said that love was true<br/>
But you ain't never fake on me<br/>
And you think that you gon find<br/>
Another G like me?<br/>
Dem nigga's ain't gon' play<br/>
They gon' just hump<br/>
They ain't gon do it yo way<br/>
I can't hate and say what they gon' do<br/>
All I know is that I'm true<br/>
And know that you my baby boo<br/>
Let's take a chance, Go to France<br/>
On a 3 day cruse<br/>
Walk with your man in the sand like ooh,<br/>
<br/>
It's our little rondez-vous<br/>
Whoopty-whoop<br/>
Big snoopy and ooh<br/>
I picture this love affair of ours<br/>
To last a lifetime just like flowers<br/>
Take a quic flick the get dressed<br/>
We'll head to Brazil,<br/>
I'll show you how it feel<br/>
When you're rollin with the real<br/>
How it feel?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Brandy and Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
We can make it, let's just stay together<br/>
Come together, don't go<br/>
Let's just have some fun and be together<br/>
Forever, for life!<br/>
<br/>
Now that we're living our life especial-ly<br/>
I say that you're my pick<br/>
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick<br/>
To me, I see you as a gift<br/>
Incredible it's edible<br/>
My ice cream, have a lick<br/>
I catch you when you fall like leaves<br/>
And be the one that you need<br/>
Come be my number one, please?<br/>
See I ain't never blow no cheese<br/>
And done no songs like these<br/>
I love the air that you breathe<br/>
You know why? (Why-Why?)<br/>
<br/>
