<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm sittin on my porch watchin the law<br/>
As they ride past in they patrol cars<br/>
So tell me why I feel like the enemy<br/>
They're supposed to be here protectin me<br/>
I might have went too far<br/>
Helpin' to contribute to makin their job hard<br/>
Servin' fiends like these people ain't no kin to me<br/>
I can't believe I'm out here killin my community<br/>
If you knew how far I came (far I came)<br/>
From where I am and where I used to be (where I used to be)<br/>
I don't want it, you can tell by the look at me<br/>
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'<br/>
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law<br/>
Baby you gotta believe me<br/>
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'<br/>
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law<br/>
Baby ya gotta believe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I know there's things I could've changed girl<br/>
I know there's things I could've done a lot better<br/>
Instead I'm in the streets tryin to make that cheddar<br/>
Thinkin in my mind that you gon' be there forever<br/>
I know I could've let it all go (let it all go)<br/>
But I was thinkin it would make life better (make life better)<br/>
Instead I'm sittin in this cell writin this letter<br/>
Thought I wouldn't get caught cause I was way too clever<br/>
I learned there's no one to catch ya when ya fallin<br/>
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're callin<br/>
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin<br/>
While you're starvin you're hearin bugs crawlin<br/>
Reminiscin' on them days you was walkin'<br/>
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossin'<br/>
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin<br/>
Somethin you see too often<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'<br/>
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law<br/>
Baby you gotta believe me<br/>
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'<br/>
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law<br/>
Baby ya gotta believe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Said I'm tired...<br/>
Said I'm tired...<br/>
I said I'm tired...<br/>
So tired, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'<br/>
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law<br/>
Baby you gotta believe me<br/>
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'<br/>
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law<br/>
Baby ya gotta believe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Akon]</i><br/>
Said I'm tired...
