<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
Like a star slipping out of place<br/>
Sliding from the sky<br/>
Tumbling through space<br/>
When you touch my hand<br/>
I swear I feel like I'm ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Yeh ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Like a wheel<br/>
Whirling round and round<br/>
Rolling down a hill (rollin' down a hill)<br/>
Spinning on the ground (rollin' down a hill)<br/>
Your kissing makes me dizzy yeh<br/>
In the head (ooh yeh)<br/>
And I'm ballin'<br/>
I'm ballin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hmm, I love this game coz this game love me back<br/>
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac<br/>
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track<br/>
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that<br/>
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars<br/>
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier<br/>
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are<br/>
Say it say it, coz they all deny it<br/>
Player play it, coz you cant deny it<br/>
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit<br/>
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch<br/>
Switch back to the old school, old fools know<br/>
This here thang we do so original<br/>
I got to have it, lavish<br/>
Is how we establish<br/>
On the real love one it feels good to have<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
Like a rose, flippin down the street<br/>
Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)<br/>
Bumpin to the beat (bumpin to the beat)<br/>
These streets they keep me busy yeh<br/>
Makin' bread<br/>
And I'm ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Yeh ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Oh here I go!<br/>
Ballin making dough<br/>
Working for myself<br/>
Coz it thrills me so<br/>
I keep women on my line<br/>
Coz they know<br/>
That I'm ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Yeh ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Oh here I go!<br/>
Driving down the road<br/>
I can't help myself<br/>
Ballin' Thrills me so<br/>
Yeh you blew my mind<br/>
And I know , I'm ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Yeh ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Do that, who that, you that one they called on<br/>
Baller' get your ball on<br/>
It's all on now fall on to a new groove<br/>
Really aint nothing to prove<br/>
We, set the mood<br/>
Or shoot some pool<br/>
Or blaze a Cool<br/>
What? Whatup fool<br/>
Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha<br/>
And once my small kitchen ?throw?<br/>
You know I gotcha<br/>
Watch out, no need to pull your glock out<br/>
It's a players affair, now<br/>
Look at my hair and the girls wit me<br/>
They got the same thang on<br/>
Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on<br/>
Coz my uncles about to get their sang on<br/>
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song<br/>
And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'<br/>
keep it ballin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3]</i><br/>
He starts to mill<br/>
Just rollin' tru his town<br/>
Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)<br/>
Raising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)<br/>
Becasuse he's loved<br/>
Loved in every city<br/>
Thats why he's ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
Yeh ballin'<br/>
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 3]</i><br/>
There it is coz it is there<br/>
Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player<br/>
They say time brings change and change brings time<br/>
It's so genuine and so divine<br/>
It's been so long in fact its overdue<br/>
Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you<br/>
I fell for you, I'll always look over you<br/>
Theres really not much that a player would'nt do for you<br/>
So quit stallin' and fallin'<br/>
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'<br/>
Now quit stallin' and callin'<br/>
And come get yaself a bar of this ballin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Yeh thats right, this is ahh, radio station 187.4 DG<br/>
Sock it to your ass<br/>
With something from The Dramatics<br/>
And Snoop Dog<br/>
Let them spot that ok<br/>
It's another one of those world premiers<br/>
Doin' it to ya doggystyle, in ya air hole<br/>
for the 2000 plus 1, yeh
