I’m from the East Coast but I’m falling so hot a nigger got me crib walking<br/>
I’m from the suburbs but it's that good you make a good girl wanna get to the hood<br/>

<br/>
is you alive<br/>

all I wanna do is like be inside you<br/>

going with your bad self baby cause I do adore<br/>
and I give you more<br/>

Jake got Beyonce I got Shante<br/>
with no entree that's my baby<br/>

when I bring em out feels so good I had to sing about<br/>
get it get it now<br/>
we flying out of town checking in the suite<br/>
pedicure on my feet<br/>
Miss Bow Wow queen of the town<br/>
hey yo Jaz tell em how I put it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
is it the way you look<br/>
is it the way you walk<br/>
is it the way you cook<br/>
is it the way you talk<br/>
I think it's all of the above<br/>
no play time in the day time making love<br/>
kids go to school<br/>
we can act a fool<br/>
skinny dip in the pool<br/>
do it real smooth<br/>
Miss Bow Wow queen of the town<br/>
hey yo Jaz tell em how I put it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>

oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
you got me saying thing I don't understand<br/>
ladies, if your man make you say, he hear to stay, he's hear to stay <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
oh oh yes I am<br/>
this my plan<br/>

take your pain<br/>
take my hand<br/>
take my name<br/>
make my kids<br/>
do your thing<br/>
ain't no game<br/>
show no shame<br/>
if I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name<br/>
so I got you got 2 1 2<br/>
put your face on my back brand new tattoo<br/>
20 year in the game what love won't do<br/>
a lot of women want me but I want you<br/>
you look cute when you smile so I renewed our vows<br/>
nowadays I ain't moving that wow<br/>
I changed my style it might happen to you<br/>
what gotten to me shit I gotten to you<br/>
and start raping about things like love and being true<br/>
now maybe we could make another baby or two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
you make me say <i>[x3]</i><br/>
so good got me speaking different languages
