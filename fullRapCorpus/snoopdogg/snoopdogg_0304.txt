<i>[Intro - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Damn, I still hear my mama’s voice<br/>
"Snoopy get your ass up and go outside and play!"<br/>
Hah, if she only knew what I was ‘bout to get off into<br/>
Bang!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg &amp; Too Short:]</i><br/>
Don’t stop being you, don’t stop being G<br/>
Egotistical, mystical, officially<br/>
Shuffle my feet to the beat with my heat in the stash<br/>
G in the bag with the C on the flag<br/>
We some real OGs baby<br/>
I was getting money in the 80’s daily<br/>
Niggas like me don’t never quit<br/>
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch<br/>
You got to tell ‘em what it is, don’t play with the game<br/>
I love it when you call a bitch out of her name<br/>
Don’t you dare try to save that ho<br/>
I know that you like her but you can’t wife her<br/>
I’m going on a tour ‘round the world<br/>
Probably fuck a whole bunch of girls<br/>
Probably get a whole bunch of money, sho’ can you save some for me?<br/>
Nah, but you can come and work for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg &amp; Too Short:]</i><br/>
Don’t stop being real, don’t stop that rap<br/>
Don’t stop showing homies how to shake that trap<br/>
I mean I seen so much but I'm still in touch with it<br/>
I don’t stop ‘cause I know y’all gon’ fuck with it<br/>
We keep going, full speed ahead with this<br/>
Niggas ain’t did the shit<br/>
Niggas ain’t real as this<br/>
We came through and peeled his bitch so quick<br/>
From the 80’s with a dope sack in my hand<br/>
To the 90’s with a DJ and a microphone stand<br/>
Can’t stop now, I’m in way too steep<br/>
Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep<br/>
Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs<br/>
The ones who real in the streets, the ones who locked in the halls<br/>
Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y’all<br/>
Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Don’t stop getting lit with the shit I spit<br/>
I know you’re down with the Dogg, I know you’re fucking with this<br/>
Don’t stop, won’t stop, this is all I know<br/>
From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl<br/>
Don’t stop getting money, bring that shit back<br/>
Don’t stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked<br/>
Can’t say much now ‘cause I’m moving a crowd<br/>
I’m moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous<br/>
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves<br/>
I made it out the motherfucking mean streets<br/>
And I still go back and touch the youth<br/>
I teach ‘em how to ball and I teach ‘em how to shoot<br/>
In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team<br/>
Teach ‘em how to rise to the top just like cream<br/>
Remain supreme by any means<br/>
Badda bang, badda bing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all<br/>
Don't stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop it, don’t stop<br/>
Don’t stop at all
