<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[static]</i><br/>
Pump Pump, Pump Pump, Pump Pump, Pump Pump<br/>
Pump Pump<br/>
<br/>
Let the motion of your body be the key, cuz we <br/>
be the motherfuckin G Funk family<br/>
Now, I'll play the G in this deadly game<br/>
Snoop Dogg is the name Dogg Pound's the game<br/>
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin nother<br/>
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother<br/>
Whether standin on the corner, or bouncin in the six-deuce<br/>
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose<br/>
Cuz back in the days, on the side where it's at<br/>
A nigga had to have a fat stack<br/>
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go<br/>
rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall<br/>
Can't none of y'all niggaz see the Doggy Dogg<br/>
Cuz I'm one rude bwoy comin with the wickedness<br/>
So shut the fuck up, and listen while I'm kickin this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Blam blam, blam to dem all<br/>
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Snoop]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now you can look to the Sun, and spot the moon<br/>
And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room<br/>
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk<br/>
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga...<br/>
I come down with the wickedness<br/>
One rude bwoy comin with the darkness (blam!)<br/>
Close your eyes cuz you can't see me<br/>
I quit school cause of recess you fuckin B.G.<br/>
I'm shakin up the party, like Lodi Dodi<br/>
Is he the dopest? Ya betta ask somebody<br/>
When, then, send, some gin<br/>
And a pack of zig zags now let the games begin<br/>
In nineteen-motherfuckin-ninety-three<br/>
I'm fuckin up every nigga known in the indistry<br/>
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thang<br/>
You know who I am you know my motherfuckin name, who am I?<br/>
(The S-N-Double-O-P) nickname (Silky Smell) last name (D-O-double-G)<br/>
The behavior and the flavor that I found<br/>
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Malik]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat<br/>
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat<br/>
Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique<br/>
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the<br/>
MC of the year, you hear and you fear<br/>
i got somethin for them niggaz in the front and the rear<br/>
I handle the sides, did a driveby in the who-ride<br/>
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright<br/>
You know when I come nigga I come wicked<br/>
Don't need no permisison, motherfucker I'ma kick it<br/>
Niggaz sweat my shit I wet em up with the biscuit<br/>
Lick em up shot, it don't stop, till dem all drop<br/>
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks<br/>
Just stop, rottin on the next niggaz jock<br/>
I'm strapped with my glock on your block<br/>
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
