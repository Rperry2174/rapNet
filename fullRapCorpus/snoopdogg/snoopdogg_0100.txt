<i>[talking while singing "Late night"]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, baby, I'm just out here trying to get this money...<br/>
I mean it's hard.. hustling late night<br/>
You know (late niight)<br/>
Some of these suckas out there tryna get what I got<br/>
Tryna pull me down (late night)<br/>
But you know.. I'm a real playa<br/>
Real hustler.. real gangsta<br/>
I'm bout getting this money (late night)<br/>
I don't give a fuck what time it is..<br/>
It can go down all night..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Button up the honcho, grab the brownies and heat<br/>
First step, to collect a nigga's bread and meat<br/>
The squares asleep<br/>
But all the hogs out on the prowl<br/>
Blocks get locked down like they off a child<br/>
Time to eat up off the streets full of fiends and hypes<br/>
Checking cream off ecstasy to the green and white<br/>
Dub sacks, the drugs packed up in kilo bricks<br/>
Getcha slang on, bang on, and keep yo chips<br/>
Baller had this, cause the savage beast did need to floss<br/>
So the hard, Bogard, and we squeezed it soft<br/>
Late night, the game tight, went up a notch or two<br/>
With fake vice, playin nice, steady watching you<br/>
Impossible, the clock when you.. ain't overtiming<br/>
The vivrant ways for crimes on the grind and start shining<br/>
9 to 5 is midnight to sunrising<br/>
Occupation gangsta committed to thug life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane]</i><br/>
On a late night..<br/>
That's the time we gone ride<br/>
Nigga, it's do or die<br/>
Late night<br/>
We ain't checking for names<br/>
When the hollow points fly<br/>
On a late night..<br/>
Deeper and deeper<br/>
We had to get into some gangsta shit<br/>
Late night<br/>
Deeper and deeper<br/>
They don't know who they fucking wit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Dead bodies with a funky smell<br/>
Throw 'em in the ocean<br/>
Jack the fo' up two times<br/>
And young nigga, keep coastin'<br/>
Turn on the DVD and watch myself on TV<br/>
It's killings after killings but they don't know it's me<br/>
It's lil' G, now what you think that stand fo?<br/>
I'm gangsta on the streets and I keep it Crippin' in the studio<br/>
Who else be up late night ready to jack like the whole house?<br/>
Gallop in yo shit like the black joust<br/>
To make it real simple and quick<br/>
If I don't have it, I gots to take yo shit<br/>
And it's all about the fast lane, nigga<br/>
When you see me on the streets, I got my finger on tha trigga<br/>
Never catch who's slippin' when I'm on them 2-wing deez<br/>
And when I get my bricks, I flood ya whole city in titties<br/>
Please believe, that I'm a lil' crazy motherfucker<br/>
Turned out by the Spillman's, Gaithen's, and Ruckas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane]</i><br/>
On a late night..<br/>
That's the time that we gone move a gang away<br/>
Late night<br/>
They call me Chef Boyardee, pushin' up some cakes<br/>
On a late night..<br/>
Deeper and deeper<br/>
I bang these streets for all so long<br/>
Late night<br/>
Deeper and deeper<br/>
Uh, wit this game that I got, I can't go wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[fades out]</i>
