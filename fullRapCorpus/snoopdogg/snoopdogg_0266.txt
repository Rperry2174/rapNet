<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Feels so real and my mind won’t let go<br/>
Let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go<br/>
Let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
In my mind I know<br/>
There’s no room without you<br/>
And you know, you know that we<br/>
That we belong together<br/>
You got the upper hand on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Feels so real but my mind won’t let go<br/>
Let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go<br/>
Let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i><br/>
I came to funk wit you one time<br/>
Making everybody wanna get up<br/>
This is the way we funk, yes sir<br/>
Making everybody wanna get up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I said it slow, so let it go<br/>
This is what we headed for<br/>
Once in a lifetime, you’re my lifeline<br/>
Baby boo on the real, it’s the right time<br/>
For us to let it out<br/>
And move you back into my house<br/>
And show you what this lovin is all about<br/>
I really didn’t think that I can turn you out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
In your mind you know<br/>
There’s no room without me<br/>
And I know, I know that we<br/>
That we belong together<br/>
I got the upper hand on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And it feels so real but my mind won’t let go<br/>
Let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go<br/>
You got to let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i><br/>
I came to funk wit you one time<br/>
Making everybody wanna get up<br/>
This is the way we funk, yes sir<br/>
Making everybody wanna get up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Feels so real but my mind won’t let go<br/>
Let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go<br/>
You got to let it go, you got to let it go<br/>
<br/>
Feels so real and my mind won’t let go
