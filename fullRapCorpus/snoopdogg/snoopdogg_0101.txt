<i>[Lil' Mo (Kokane)]</i><br/>
Roll with me<br/>
Come smoke with me (Smoke with me)<br/>
Come close to me<br/>
So low (Come flow with me)<br/>
Dance with me<br/>
Take a chance with me (This is your chance)<br/>
Take a dip with me<br/>
Don't go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Oh no, I have a party to attend<br/>
With some civilized people, and some more of my friends<br/>
I wish I could stick around<br/>
But I gotta take a trip back uptown, now<br/>
Layin wit'chu, stayin wit'chu<br/>
Playin wit'chu, is somethin I ain't gone do<br/>
Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here<br/>
And I done already been there, so I don't really care<br/>
Now you can take that, take that<br/>
Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that<br/>
You can't do nothin about it<br/>
You know damn well what I got back at the house<br/>
And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes<br/>
Gimme the blues, hand my the booze<br/>
Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it<br/>
So I'm skatin steady, datin on the move to groove<br/>
I ain't got nothin to prove infact, I got too much to lose<br/>
Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool<br/>
But I ain't leavin here wit'chu, for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Yo, this the single house<br/>
We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch<br/>
Everybody get they groove on<br/>
I'm sweatin like a rainy day, but I get my groove on<br/>
Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips<br/>
Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13<br/>
Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean<br/>
Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up<br/>
Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up<br/>
Dog walk to the cat walk<br/>
I'm ridin that ass like Tony Hawk<br/>
There's somethin about the way you blow my mind<br/>
Got me wanna boogie all the time<br/>
Baby this is what I'm lovin<br/>
Forget the last dance just to end up huggin, let's dance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Lil' momma got a gang of ass<br/>
Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast<br/>
Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance<br/>
Spark a conversation to ignite the flash<br/>
Bling bling all gleam, and I'm clean to whip<br/>
Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin with<br/>
You can act like the mack don't effect your type<br/>
Cuz you know a nigga tryin to have sex tonight<br/>
Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy<br/>
Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy<br/>
Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet<br/>
Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat<br/>
You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete<br/>
But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep<br/>
Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me<br/>
Girl cuz I'ma give it to ya like it's 'sposed to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane]</i><br/>
Come fuck with me<br/>
Drink with me<br/>
Smoke with me<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Loc with me<br/>
Drink some Hennesey<br/>
Goldie Loc, and Tray Deee<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop talking (Lil' Mo singing in background)]</i><br/>
Yeah you tryin to fuck with a nigga huh<br/>
I can't even trip though<br/>
It might seem like, some shit like, two-two<br/>
Beep-beep, haha, two-two<br/>
Beep-beep, two-two <i>[Repeat until fade]</i>
