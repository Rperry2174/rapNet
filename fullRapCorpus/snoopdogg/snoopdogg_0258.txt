Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
And I can't go another day<br/>
You make it hard to stay awake<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Ain't no other words to say<br/>
You make it hard for me to stay<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
<br/>
And my mind is all about you<br/>
I don't know what to do cuz you have got me confused<br/>
We're talkin on the phone<br/>
We fuss and fight, you bout that life<br/>
I just wanna love you right<br/>
Love you right<br/>
<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
And I can't go another day<br/>
You make it hard to stay awake<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Ain't no other words to say<br/>
You make it hard for me to stay<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
<br/>
Make time to make love<br/>
That's what we made<br/>
Lookin nowadays, lookin like it's gon fade<br/>
Tee Wee when they see he a G so<br/>
If he lose baby he gon gain another though<br/>
What a brother know? Keep it on the low<br/>
That's what my grandma say<br/>
It's supposed to go<br/>
Feel the same, we toastin, post<br/>
And if it all works out then we Casper the ghost<br/>
Me and Dan Funk, we capture the fun<br/>
Commune shit and lose shit, we set it all for<br/>
Playin with me, oh you best let it all go<br/>
The vish, in the wind you blow<br/>
<br/>
I'm fadin away<br/>
And I can't go another day<br/>
You make it hard to stay awake<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Ain't no other words to say<br/>
You make it hard for me to stay<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
<br/>
Yea<br/>
This is uh<br/>
Snoopy Collins<br/>
Long time, no hear from<br/>
Can you smell me?<br/>
That's Dan Funk<br/>
Uh<br/>
Girlâ€¦ you got me fadin away<br/>
The love you used to love<br/>
Just doesn't appear anymore<br/>
Find and you shall seek<br/>
Seek and you shall find<br/>
Find time to unwind<br/>
Yea baby<br/>
<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
And I can't go another day<br/>
You make it hard to stay awake<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Ain't no other words to say<br/>
You make it hard for me to stay<br/>
Girl you got me fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
<br/>
It's hard to stay wit you girl<br/>
It's so hard to stay wit you girl<br/>
And even harder to play wit you girl<br/>
It's so hard to stay wit you girl<br/>
And even harder to play wit you girl<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
Fadin away<br/>
Fadin away
