<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West<br/>
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow<br/>
Y'all niggaz know who I am y'all niggaz tearin up shit<br/>
But we got somethin old, and somethin new for y'all tongiht<br/>
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg<br/>
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go<br/>
I'm hearin motherfuckers tryin to steal my flow<br/>
But it ain't no thang cause see my nigga Coolio<br/>
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'<br/>
Ya know, some of these niggaz is so deceptive<br/>
Usin my styles like a contraceptive<br/>
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya havn't learnt<br/>
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack<br/>
So put your gun away, run away, cuz i'm back (why?)<br/>
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now<br/>
Tell me what's goin on<br/>
It make me wanna holler, cuz my dollars come in ozones<br/>
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes<br/>
and quit tryin to spit at my motherfuckin hoes<br/>
Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point<br/>
You think you got the bomb cuz I rolled you a joint<br/>
You'se a flea and i'm the big Dogg<br/>
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin paws<br/>
Y'alls, niggaz, better recognize<br/>
And see where I'm comin from it's still East Side till I die<br/>
Why ask why?  As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-Y<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a Doggy Dogg World<br/>
It's a Doggy Dogg World, it's a Doggy Dogg World<br/>
The Dogg's World<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:  Kurupt]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten <br/>
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin juice and gin<br/>
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers<br/>
Styles vary, packin flavor like Life Savors<br/>
Ain't that somethin, talk shit and I'm dumpin<br/>
I had your whole fuckin block bumpin<br/>
Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China<br/>
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya<br/>
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through<br/>
One-two, three, you can't see me<br/>
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics<br/>
A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets<br/>
It's on again, it's on and poppin<br/>
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin<br/>
I wanna see some panties droppin<br/>
I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton<br/>
(All I ever did was just use that hoe<br/>
 Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)<br/>
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news<br/>
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes<br/>
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs<br/>
and I smoke weed for the fuck of it<br/>
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked<br/>
but it's manditory that I kick it<br/>
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it<br/>
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin<br/>
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin<br/>
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn<br/>
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin<br/>
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action<br/>
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog<br/>
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)<br/>
Tell when (till the early morn)<br/>
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)<br/>
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)<br/>
<br/>
Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'<br/>
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow<br/>
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick<br/>
Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)<br/>
Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about <br/>
the city where I'm from, dum diddy dum<br/>
As you groove to the gangster shit<br/>
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique<br/>
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk<br/>
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want<br/>
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high<br/>
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
