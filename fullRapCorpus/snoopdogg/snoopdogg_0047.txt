The stock market has always been 100% when it comes to pussy<br/>
The worlds oldest profession<br/>
Yah it's still alive<br/>
No matter what the consequences<br/>
A trick 'gun still buy it<br/>
No matter how sick they make it<br/>
A hard stick gunna still wanna play it<br/>
Marching up, every day and every night<br/>
To the drummers beat<br/>
Titled the oldest profession, and it never fell back<br/>
Not even in the recession<br/>
No Christmas toys for the kids<br/>
Yah daddy fucked it up<br/>
He said he was drunk playing poker with the boys<br/>
Yah niggas pay for pussy<br/>
Remember that Easter Sunday<br/>
It was so damn sunny<br/>
We didn't get no Easter clothes, candy, or Easter bunny<br/>
Yah, daddy fucked it up<br/>
Rollin' dice with the boys<br/>
Yah niggas pay for pussy<br/>
Whether it's at the tity bar<br/>
Or outta the car<br/>
Yah niggas pay for pussy<br/>
<br/>
OHH yah, Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah<br/>
Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah<br/>
Some niggas pay for pussy, oh yah<br/>
Dem niggas pay for pussy, oh yah<br/>
Niggas pay for pussy, oh yah
