Big Snoop Dogg<br/>
Can you be my doctor?<br/>
Can you fix me up?<br/>
Can you wipe me down?<br/>
So I can lick you up<br/>
Make you give it up, Give it up<br/>
Til you say my name<br/>
Like a jersey, jersey<br/>
shittin' down the game<br/>
Be my head coach<br/>
So you can put me in<br/>
And never take me off<br/>
Til you can taste the win<br/>
Do it again and again<br/>
Til you say my name<br/>
And by the way I'm so glad that you came<br/>
<br/>
Tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)<br/>
I'm gonna get you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)<br/>
Tell tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)<br/>
I just wanna get you wet wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)<br/>
<br/>
Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami<br/>
Can you drip, drip, drip,<br/>
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami<br/>
Can you drip, drip, drip<br/>
<br/>
She's hot on a rainy day<br/>
Don't drown<br/>
Call me up<br/>
I can save you now<br/>
Lick your feet and kiss your mouth<br/>
Swisha sweet, I got you out<br/>
There's only one way we can stop the drought<br/>
Come with me take a trip down south<br/>
I can tell she's thirsty<br/>
I'm in the hole like a birdie<br/>
What you wanna do tonight<br/>
It's still early<br/>
Wanna get spewed tonight<br/>
She's all sturdy<br/>
I'm in between your lips<br/>
Like a cigarette<br/>
She wanna quit<br/>
But she wanna make it, make it, make it wet<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna get you wet<br/>
Tell tell me baby are you wet<br/>
I just wanna get you wet wet<br/>
<br/>
Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami<br/>
Can you drip, drip, drip,<br/>
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami<br/>
Can you drip, drip, drip<br/>
<br/>
Can you, can you get me up?<br/>
Like I'm wait for the first class<br/>
So I can give it to you rough<br/>
Like a first draft<br/>
Would you like a paper plane<br/>
You know 'bout that paper babe<br/>
But fuck them dollar bills<br/>
Girl make it rain<br/>
holiday Inn, come<br/>
Meet me on the 8th floor<br/>
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though<br/>
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n slide<br/>
It's a flood in your heart love<br/>
Girl let me pop up in your hot tub<br/>
Every night every day<br/>
Sippin' on a different drink<br/>
Different chicks different days<br/>
I do it different ways<br/>
Where you going<br/>
What'd you say<br/>
I want her river flowing to another lake<br/>
Another ocean another ocean<br/>
On the beach on the beach<br/>
I'm bout to take a swim<br/>
Let let me dip my feet and get wet<br/>
<br/>
I wanna get you wet<br/>
Tell tell me baby are you wet<br/>
I just wanna get you wet wet wet<br/>
<br/>
Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami<br/>
Can you drip, drip, drip,<br/>
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami<br/>
Can you drip, drip, drip
