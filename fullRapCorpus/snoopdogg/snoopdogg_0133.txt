Niggas, get your milla genuine draft, cause its milla time, we about to go hard on these hoes on<br/>
this one right here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[soopafly]</i> Can you control your hoe? (You got a bitch that wont do what you say)<br/>
You can’t control your hoe? (She hardheaded, she just won’t obey)<br/>
Can you control your hoe? (You’ve got to know what to do, and what to say)<br/>
You’ve got to put that bitch in her place, even if it’s slapping her in her face.<br/>
Ya got to control your hoe. Can you control your hoe? <br/>
<br/>
I went to your house; your girl came in and started cussing you out. You should have slapped her<br/>
in her face, I wanted to tell you, but it wasn’t my place. I kept it on the low, cause I know you<br/>
was gonna check that hoe. But instead, you was quiet as a mouse, maybe you started to think it<br/>
wasn’t your house. Cause she was acting like a nut, you got a kind of bitch that would kick your<br/>
butt. What kind of pimp holds back? Never met a bitch that a pimp can’t slap, whats wrong with<br/>
the pimpin’? Why you get a whippin’? All I got to say is this:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: 2]</i><br/>
This is what you made me do; I really didn’t want to put hands on you. But bitch you playin’<br/>
with fire, i'm so sick and tired, of loud mouth bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips<br/>
on you, cause bitch you playin’ with fire, i'm so sick and tired. <br/>
<br/>
This is what you forced me to do, I really didn’t want to put hands on you, but bitch you<br/>
playin’ with fire, i'm so sick and tired. Of bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips on<br/>
you, bitch you playin’ with fire, I’m so sick and tired.  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(No: can you control your hoe? At the end.)
