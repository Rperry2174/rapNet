<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Late night on the move, what you bitches wanna do?<br/>
We can do a hotel or get up in a swimming pool<br/>
Set up on the mountaintop, let you get a hella view<br/>
Once you get the diznick, you do what I tell it to<br/>
Ain't no telling like Jacks on<br/>
You can kick it with a he-she or chill out with a felon<br/>
I'm a go gorilla not your average bitch nigga<br/>
All I want is your money but I just might hit up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Money gone<br/>
Got your bitch on my cellphone<br/>
Tryna get with a nigga but I'm bout gone<br/>
Gone like a motherfucker, really not tripping man<br/>
I'm fucking with these hoes and I'm getting all these bitches man, bitches man<br/>
With the game of the players and and I'm only<br/>
Big fame with the game, man I'm certified<br/>
Won't say, Ros√© went to her defense<br/>
Don't say nothing nigga that's my bitch<br/>
Hoes say late night when it fall apart<br/>
They say and I took her from you in the dark<br/>
Inner freeze and I end up with the car keys<br/>
Had to put the bomb weed, as I break a bomb bitch<br/>
And they say you roam in the centerfold<br/>
But she bomb and she grown and she wanna go<br/>
So I put her in the back of a Sprinter Van<br/>
Rent A Center... van, yeah I went up in her man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
See on the late night tip<br/>
I know a lot of y'all even know what it is, but let me talk to the bitches for a minute<br/>
Yeah, excuse my French, yeah, real spit<br/>
See here's the thing right here baby<br/>
Now when you with a mac you gotta get maced<br/>
And when you with a pimp you gotta get pimped<br/>
But when you with a player you gon get played<br/>
So which one is it? Cause it's late night, choose up<br/>
Slide up outta them store shoes and slip into these hoe shoes<br/>
Yeah, like Pimping Silky say, see about it<br/>
Haha yeah, it's late night, it's real late, it's too late to be talking<br/>
I mean it's too late for anything but uh... doing what we came here to do, so let's get it<br/>
<br/>
