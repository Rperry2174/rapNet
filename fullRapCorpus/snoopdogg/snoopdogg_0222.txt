I had seen a lot of niggers come up in this game<br/>
But never did they make the look so good<br/>
From candy cars to bright yellow bras<br/>
The gangster white walls and the wood<br/>
<br/>
You see, there comes a time in a man's life<br/>
Where you gotta choose the goods of the game<br/>
Oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place<br/>
Where everybody knows your name<br/>
<br/>
It's a cold game, I ain't been one to<br/>
Jump in and out of the range<br/>
Maybe an old school synagogue<br/>
Spinnin' the vision from which I faint<br/>
<br/>
You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'<br/>
East Side High enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind<br/>
The state that I'm in is gangster bliss<br/>
This is what you're callin' a sis<br/>
Passin' them off quick, memories missed<br/>
<br/>
I made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money<br/>
Been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin'<br/>
In fact, I got better, clutchin' on Beretta's<br/>
Blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether<br/>
<br/>
A war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll<br/>
And I never be questioned by some new young chump<br/>
Poppin' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk<br/>
Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done<br/>
Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?<br/>
<br/>
Hold closer my hands from my throne<br/>
And I never be crucified within my own zone<br/>
Here is a very good reason to show love<br/>
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug<br/>
<br/>
From mamas goin' down for murder in '93<br/>
To keys all over the city bowlin' in Snoops league<br/>
I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter<br/>
Two sons, beautiful wife for starters<br/>
<br/>
I did it all, Jack, poppin' this peas<br/>
Eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah<br/>
Don't judge me, you only knew Snoopy<br/>
You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up<br/>
<br/>
Like some loco, I earned my respect<br/>
Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check<br/>
But all in all, I did it, B, cool as a blind with a C<br/>
Leveled my life as I push away the groupies<br/>
Snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about your circumstances<br/>
Take your chances, still from the B, L, B, C<br/>
For you are the C<br/>
Haler at you're the Snoopy<br/>
Haler at you're the Snoopy<br/>
<br/>
I paid my dues<br/>
And now it's time to make a change<br/>
Gotta make that move<br/>
There's a time and place for everythin'<br/>
<br/>
I paid my dues<br/>
And now it's time to make a change<br/>
Gotta make that move<br/>
There's a time and place for everythin'<br/>
<br/>
I paid my dues<br/>
And now it's time to make a change<br/>
Gotta make that move<br/>
There's a time and place for everythin'<br/>
<br/>
I paid my dues<br/>
And now it's time to make a change<br/>
Gotta make that move<br/>
There's a time and place for everythin'<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about your circumstances<br/>
Take your chances, still from the L B C<br/>
For you are the C<br/>
Haler at you're the Snoopy<br/>
Haler at you're the Snoopy
