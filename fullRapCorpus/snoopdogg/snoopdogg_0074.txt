<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Whassup nephew?<br/>
Sittin here choppin game, my nigga Bad Azz<br/>
Niggaz get the misconception of us<br/>
cause we so cold at what we do<br/>
But I really wanna let niggaz know what's happenin though<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: KoKane, Snoop]</i><br/>
<i>[K]</i> Now I don't want anybody<br/>
to get the wrong idea about me<br/>
I don't have nothin to hide<br/>
I want the world to see..<br/>
<i>[S]</i> I'm a gangsta gangsta<br/>
Gangsta niggaz do your dance<br/>
(C-Walk, C-Walk homey, yeah)<br/>
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bad Azz]</i><br/>
See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars<br/>
Poppin collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers<br/>
See we smoke and go hoein cause the bitch ain't never shit to me<br/>
and pussy stay sellin, so I never let it get to me<br/>
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials<br/>
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original<br/>
Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo<br/>
Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though<br/>
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again<br/>
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower<br/>
While, you get nothin, we keep gettin more<br/>
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top<br/>
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block<br/>
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga<br/>
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga<br/>
(Yeah, nigga what?)  Holla at 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East<br/>
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least<br/>
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back<br/>
of they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star<br/>
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool mayn<br/>
Go on and do yo' thang, gang-bang<br/>
in the hood and in Hollywood<br/>
Record company executives think it's all to the good<br/>
Get to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back<br/>
and had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayn<br/>
I'm down with P, and D-R-E<br/>
A real nigga from the motherfuckin L.B.C.<br/>
I just look like this, I stay down for the twist<br/>
I'm real with this, deep as abyss<br/>
I gave you a pound, then I gave yo' wife a kiss<br/>
I had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullsheeit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 3X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[singing ad libs by KoKane to fade]</i>
