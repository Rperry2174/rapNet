Staxxx in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage <i>[x2]</i><br/>
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Rodg.<br/>
<br/>
It's the same story, a nigga rich,<br/>
I'm on some nigga shit, and you're nigga bitch!<br/>
You better check 'em, tell 'em I'm off the chain,<br/>
I buck and bang, homie that's only game,<br/>
Oh I ain't got a problem, you see me get the staxxx,<br/>
You see I bought the Phantom, 24's don't come with that,<br/>
I've been around the world, check gripping every state,<br/>
You bitch don't like me, she fake, so people might call it hate,<br/>
But I don't give a damn, a boss's life is how I make that bread,<br/>
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich and have you bitch make my bed,<br/>
My pockets fat as shit, you niggas mad as shit,<br/>
Fuck neither Warner bro's, I'm on some Gladys shit,<br/>
Many have tried and failed, shit I'm out on bail,<br/>
I make more cheese than your old man and he went to Yale,<br/>
Shit I went to jail, you can go to hell,<br/>
You got some shit to tell, I got some shit to sell.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got staxxx in my jeans Phantom up in my garage,<br/>
I got staxxx in my jeans Phantom up in my garage,<br/>
I got staxxx in my jeans Phantom up in my garage (yeah!)<br/>
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Rodg.<br/>
<br/>
Candy paint dripping, look at all them bags,<br/>
I had to show and brag, 'cause being broke's a drag,<br/>
I gotta get this paper, my kids they gotta eat!<br/>
We got a lot of heat, just case them dollars, cease,<br/>
Been out for balling, shot calling and I make that change,<br/>
And I don't want the Range, chop that spray on things,<br/>
That's how gangsters do it, we get our green and bricks,<br/>
We put our green in blunts, you spend your green on chicks,<br/>
I'm on some player shit, dynasty straight Lakers shit,<br/>
Cook it up on some baker shit, and chop it up on some paper bitch!<br/>
I got my mind right, and my money right,<br/>
If you ain't in the game for the money, you the funny type,<br/>
And I'm laughing my ass off, Phantom with the mask off,<br/>
Legal, so they hating when I gas off,<br/>
You know how Snoopy does it, Phantom, don't bitch touch it,<br/>
One hundred thousand a show, I'm getting dough like fuck!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Look how that flag hanging, gangbanging I ain't no punk,<br/>
Maintain till that thing came out the truck, make that (A)K go pop pop pop!<br/>
I'm about my bidness boy, making money never been so smooth,<br/>
You bitch you're about to lose, 'cause she's about to choose!<br/>
And that's the way it goes, S N double O,<br/>
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble ho!<br/>
Now go get paper girl, yeah, I meant for real,<br/>
One time I told a bitch not to come back till she got two thousand dollars in two dollar bills! (Wow!)<br/>
That's cold game, a ho thing,<br/>
I'm high as Soul Plane, I smoked the whole thing,<br/>
You know how daddy do it, I'm true to it,<br/>
I take a cocaine, bew it then put some blue to it!<br/>
That's some gangster shit, these hoes love this gangster dick,<br/>
Khaki's and some gangster kicks, yeah, bitch, that's my gangster fit,<br/>
I'm balling boy, and you ain't got to ask,<br/>
She all about this pimping, I'm all about this cash,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
