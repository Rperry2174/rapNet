<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Ehehe, oh really?<br/>
You know what? .. You talk too much<br/>
Hoe get up out my face unless you tryin to fuck<br/>
Cause on the real a nigga kinda drunk<br/>
And right now the way you lookin bitch you fly as fuck<br/>
I don't even know if I done had too much<br/>
You play too much, I had to fuck<br/>
Cuddled you up and put my hands on your butt<br/>
Rubbin your stuff and now your pants full of nut<br/>
.. You can't tell me nuttin<br/>
Let me shoot my thang on your bellybutton<br/>
I got to, keep it gangsta<br/>
Your homegirl want some, I just might bank her<br/>
Shank her, bank her, and take her bankroll<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg and my game is way cold<br/>
Never, ever, overexpose<br/>
I usually got a car with a room full of hizzoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly<br/>
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?<br/>
Shake it, bake this thing for me<br/>
Cause you just flow so viciously<br/>
Soopa-Duper, you so fly<br/>
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?<br/>
Shake it, bake this thing for me<br/>
Cause you just flow so viciously<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soopafly]</i><br/>
Now bitch, check it out, where my money, c'mon break it out<br/>
Just sayin hoe, I ain't playin c'mon, take it out<br/>
Dick down the track, c'mon, we gon' work it out<br/>
Straight pimp shit we on, we gon' church it out<br/>
(If you don't know) I'm quick to change up stick<br/>
My dick in yo' mouth and aim up<br/>
Open up your eyes you'll see my navel<br/>
Flip down my drawers, you'll see that label<br/>
Sniffed so much 'caine/Kane, the bitch got able/Abel<br/>
Put the switch on, directed my cable<br/>
Splash!  What head work and what ass<br/>
Bitch stop my dick hurtin, now fuck Daz<br/>
Run fast if I tell ya bitch walk<br/>
Get caught, I'm takin all that bitch got<br/>
I don't need no relationship<br/>
All I really had in mind was my dick, yo' face and lips, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly<br/>
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?<br/>
Shake it, bake this thing for me<br/>
Cause you just flow so viciously<br/>
Hovi Baby, you so fly<br/>
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?<br/>
Shake it, bake this thing for me<br/>
Cause you just flow so viciously<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Young! Woo! Hov'! Yes<br/>
She wanna meet the only king on the East coast<br/>
Hook me up witcha boy Snoop she said he so low<br/>
I never get the chance to get at him<br/>
Only on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah<br/>
Listen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him<br/>
If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!<br/>
.. Hov ain't into backwards mackin<br/>
.. How backwards that is<br/>
.. I don't love 'em though<br/>
'Less makin a little paper then I love 'em the most<br/>
If she's, sneakin in the club with the toast<br/>
I'm flyin the friendly skies with 36 hoes<br/>
Shit, I can get a chef to cook for me<br/>
Talk about some paper if you tryin to book me<br/>
Ma, you can keep your head<br/>
I got, expensive habits that need the bread<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly<br/>
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?<br/>
Shake it, bake this thing for me<br/>
Cause you just flow so viciously<br/>
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly<br/>
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?<br/>
Shake it, bake this thing for me<br/>
Cause you just flow so viciously<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go do the bump.. give me that funky stuff" <i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I like the way you shakin that ass, so don't stop<br/>
Slang that ass like I used to slang rocks<br/>
Bend over trick let me get to that spot<br/>
Later on you can lick on my lollipop<br/>
I like the way you shakin that ass, so don't quit<br/>
You know you get a hella response from my dick<br/>
Don't put your fuckin clothes back on 'til you rich<br/>
The type of woman I want tonight, a straight bitch!
