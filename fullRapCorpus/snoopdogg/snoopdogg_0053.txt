<i>[Suga Free]</i><br/>
No, uh-uh excuse me wait baby treat yo' cash<br/>
And remind me when we get home to get goin<br/>
and crack my whip and pack yo' shit<br/>

Naw bitch look at me when I talk to you<br/>
I checked the bitch and said, "Ah-hah some shit?<br/>
No ub-uh, shut up, you gon' do what I tell you to do!"<br/>
Now name three motherfuckers you can call.. you cain't<br/>
One pimpin that, two pimpin that, three pimpin that<br/>
That bitch got off! (Say what my nigga Suga Free, what you say?)<br/>
Snoop say what? (Huh?) I said<br/>

Or lady I'ma have to go (see ya, see ya!)<br/>
Suga Free, bitch that don't stand for some old nice ass nigga<br/>
tryin to get some pussy and you tryin to get some of this dick free<br/>
I'm live ta be a old-ass pimp with cataracts<br/>
Reminscin on regular park trees with the homies<br/>
and slappin bitches in Cadillacs<br/>
<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much!<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much!  Heyyy<br/>

<i>[Sylk E. Fine]</i><br/>
Now check me, I'm in a helluva situation<br/>
I got LOVE for the homegirl but it ain't no escapin<br/>
Now I've been waitin fo' the chance fo' me to do my thang<br/>
Cause when I GO OUT baby, I GO OUT with a bang! (bang bang)<br/>
Thursday night, 'bout to hang out at the House of Blues<br/>
Fresh attire, new shoes, plus a new, hairdo, WHOO!<br/>
I'm mesmerized by the music that they bump in the club<br/>
I see my homegirl man (whas' happenin, whas' up?)<br/>
lookin like he need some love<br/>
And everytime I see him, he been givin me the eye<br/>
Cause he my type and I'm his type and plus we love to ride<br/>
Imagine that, off we left<br/>
Hot sweat hot sex it ain't like we just met (ahh, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Why she trust me?  Since his girl went on a little trip<br/>
I made his sweat drip, he made me strip<br/>
It ain't my fault he in a fucked up relationship<br/>
That just go to show, you never know who you dealin with<br/>
Love over friendship, that's why I live my life trustless, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much!<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much!  Heyyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Hmm, I spent the night at the homie's house, shit<br/>
Slept in his livingroom, on his couch<br/>
Nigga high'n a motherfucker burnt out (shit)<br/>
Before you know it, god damn, the homie chirped out (damn!)<br/>
And he ain't said shit, he just dip in his Seville as he peel<br/>
Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?<br/>
Now baby got a gown on, gettin her clown on<br/>
As she slid downstairs, now she takin me down home<br/>
Cheatin in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom<br/>
Am I wrong?  Shit, on and on and on and on<br/>
Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you<br/>
His baby momma in my face, she shakin poo-poo, what would you do?<br/>
Trust is a motherfuckin loco, shit<br/>
and so is temptation, and I don't know what I'ma do<br/>
Come on through (come on through) so I can cum on you (cum on you)<br/>
Shit if the homey knew (if the homey knew) if the homey knew<br/>
(if the homey knew)<br/>
<br/>
I wish you wouldn't trust me so much<br/>
