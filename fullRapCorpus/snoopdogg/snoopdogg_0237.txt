High school nigga<br/>
And they're tryin to get the smoke outta the booth<br/>
But their not doing a good job<br/>
Ohhh, oh, oh, oh, oh ohh<br/>
My grades gettin low<br/>
But I'm still gettin high<br/>
It might seem slow<br/>
But time still goin byyyy<br/>
Hey<br/>
Oh and I forgot to mention<br/>
My girlfriends trippin<br/>
And my homies ain't acting the same<br/>
Well as long as there's papers and grinders<br/>
I'm taking my time and Imma roll my weed<br/>
And take one to the brain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
One more yeah I'm always puffin<br/>
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it<br/>
Had nothin, but now I'm stuntin<br/>
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn<br/>
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen<br/>
And everywhere I go yea I'm loaded<br/>
<br/>
You know my money been kinda funny<br/>
But I'm still gettin fly<br/>
And uhm I don't got the best wheels<br/>
But the hoes still jump inside<br/>
Oh and I forgot to mention<br/>
My bestfriends trippin<br/>
Me I'm doing all that I can<br/>
But as long I stay on my grind<br/>
There's gonna be haters outsiders<br/>
Tryin to take my shine<br/>
And now their part of the plan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I guess if you insist I will<br/>
I'm a twister feel mista feel good to ya<br/>
I got it if ya need it and you kno I will<br/>
And this is after school so we gon go until<br/>
The janitor, handed her, a pack of that<br/>
Righteously she brought it all back to mac<br/>
So I'm a do it back to back, got her fat<br/>
Bags are packed, posted by the cafeteria<br/>
Eatin on a snack, boy I make it crack-a-lack<br/>
Days goin to my nights, live a young wild life<br/>
King of the zoo<br/>
Devon what it do<br/>
Knockin all trees down, devin mac with the sac<br/>
Rollin up with knees down, baby girl ease down<br/>
It's a holiday, we smokin pot today<br/>
I got alot to say, I keep it locked away<br/>
That's how it is<br/>
Dealin with the pressures of my school life<br/>
Livin on the edge, joints to the head<br/>
And so the man said...<br/>
<br/>
