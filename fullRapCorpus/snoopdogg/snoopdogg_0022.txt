<i>[Intro: (distressed Latino woman)]</i><br/>
<br/>
The dog saw 'im...they tear...they...looked liked they try to tear him off.<br/>
I said "Oh my God! They want to eat my husband<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I was sittin at the pound about to eat dinner<br/>
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner<br/>
My nigga Sparky-O was playin basketball<br/>
and my niggas in the backyard, y'all about to squab my Doggz<br/>
Dirty ???? gets CREAM, it's a good scheme<br/>
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team<br/>
I squabble...Friday cos that's what I do<br/>
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew<br/>
but you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap<br/>
They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back<br/>
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate<br/>
he gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him<br/>
Now they've got Michael Corleone<br/>
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin<br/>
He likes to smash on, uhh<br/>
and ain't no need to reach for heat cos you can't get your blast on<br/>
Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em<br/>
and when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma<br/>
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws<br/>
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz<br/>
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey<br/>
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him<br/>
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?<br/>
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him<br/>
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game<br/>
but when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang<br/>
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down<br/>
cos if you don't then you can't represent the Pound<br/>
Now it's like a sport<br/>
and if I get caught I'm right back in court<br/>
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell<br/>
but you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell<br/>
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick<br/>
cos I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs<br/>
Ask my little homey Technique<br/>
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG<br/>
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat<br/>
but the rest of the pits they rollin wit me<br/>
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino<br/>
Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos<br/>
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick<br/>
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me<br/>
???? bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet<br/>
to get the bitch up off me<br/>
and I can't tame her and I can't blame her<br/>
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer<br/>
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all<br/>
but I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz<br/>
It's just....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Me &amp; my Doggz (sick em), me &amp; my Doggz (sick em)<br/>
(Beware, beware) Me &amp; my Doggz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese<br/>
but as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest<br/>
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim<br/>
I'm bout to trip off Locko cos he go taken my swim<br/>
I think cos my CREAMy low, get back to the pound<br/>
He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown<br/>
and when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2<br/>
and ain't a damn thang that your ass can do<br/>
I think it's cos he lost his big homey Don Killer see<br/>
who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP<br/>
and leave your ass red and yeah half-head<br/>
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg<br/>
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear<br/>
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head<br/>
and all the kid do was cry like a bitch<br/>
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Beware, beware)<br/>
(Sick em) It's just me &amp; my Doggz<br/>
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard<br/>
Just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: (reporter speaking over hook)]</i><br/>
<br/>
....deadly serious in East Los Angeles and South Central where people<br/>
encounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it)
