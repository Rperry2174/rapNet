<i>[Chorus - X2]</i><br/>
(Make It Good) You got one chance to crack<br/>
One shot to pop, better hit the spot<br/>
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line<br/>
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now you've been waitin', patient<br/>
Dinner datin', classic chasin'<br/>
Your homies hatin', 'cause you're never around<br/>
You're either at the movies or you're out shoppin' around<br/>
All that for the cat, it's a wrap<br/>
You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that<br/>
If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder<br/>
than any other brotha, the Karma Sutra be the author<br/>
Be her father, be a man, be the man<br/>
that made her never wanna see another man<br/>
Make it better than good, make it great<br/>
Make her visit, then make her stay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - X2]</i><br/>
(Make It Good) You got one chance to crack<br/>
One shot to pop, better hit the spot<br/>
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line<br/>
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah man, if you got a real one<br/>
You better hold on to her<br/>
See 'cause a real man will come along the way<br/>
And smooth knock her... <br/>
<br/>
If you like her, wife her<br/>
If you love her, smother her<br/>
With that stuff that'll make her feel the same way<br/>
And pull that ring out on the same day<br/>
A couple heirs with the horse and the carriage<br/>
You gon' lose if you scared of marriage<br/>
A real boss got a foundation<br/>
You need somebody in your life with patience<br/>
minus the hate... Shante what more can I say?<br/>
But baby look at us today<br/>
Your husband's a boss, the kids is cute<br/>
King of the Coast with a gang of loot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - X2]</i><br/>
(Make It Good) You got one chance to crack<br/>
One shot to pop, better hit the spot<br/>
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line<br/>
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I'ma make it good for you, make it hood for you<br/>
Make it do what he couldn't do for you<br/>
Tha Doggfather supreme, jump in the shower<br/>
I appear through the steam<br/>
Braids and all, over six foot tall<br/>
Can't no other brotha fade the Dogg<br/>
I'm all ya need, I'm who ya want<br/>
I'm here to coach ya through your do's and don'ts and he won't<br/>
I got the remedy, the energy<br/>
It's your mama, your daddy, and then it's me<br/>
Bad talk a boss, I wish a player would<br/>
Close your eyes baby girl, let me (Make It Good)
