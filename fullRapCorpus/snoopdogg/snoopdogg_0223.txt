Big Snoop Dogg<br/>
Can you be my doctor?<br/>
Can you fix me up?<br/>
Can you wipe me down?<br/>
<br/>
So I can make you give it up give it up<br/>
Until you say my name<br/>
Like a Jersey Jersey shuttin' down the game<br/>
<br/>
Be my head coach<br/>
So you can...<br/>
And never take me out<br/>
Till you can taste the way<br/>
Do it again, and again till you say my name<br/>
<br/>
And by the way<br/>
I'm so glad<br/>
I just wanna make you sweat<br/>
I wanna make you sweat<br/>
I just wanna make you sweat<br/>
I wanna make you sweat<br/>
Sweat, sweat<br/>
<br/>
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip<br/>
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip<br/>
<br/>
Shes hot on a rainy day<br/>
Don't drown<br/>
Call call me up, I I I can save you now<br/>
(Lick your feet and kiss your lap)?<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
There's only one way we can stop the drought<br/>
Come with me<br/>
We can take a trip down south<br/>
<br/>
I can tell shes thirsty<br/>
I'm in the whoa like a birdy<br/>
Whatcha wanna do tonight?<br/>
It's still early<br/>
<br/>
Wanna get some tonight<br/>
Shes all sturdy<br/>
I'm in I'm in<br/>
Like a cigarette<br/>
She wanna quit<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna make you sweat<br/>
I wanna make you sweat<br/>
I just wanna make you sweat<br/>
I wanna make you sweat<br/>
Sweat, sweat<br/>
<br/>
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip<br/>
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip<br/>
<br/>
Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class<br/>
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft<br/>
Hold you like a paper plane<br/>
You know I got paper babe<br/>
Them dollar bills<br/>
Girl I'll make it rain<br/>
<br/>
Holiday Inn<br/>
Come and meet me on my eighth floor<br/>
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for (them next door)?<br/>
And I, I I I up on the <i>[?]</i><br/>
When I slip slip slip like two girls into slip n' slide<br/>
<br/>
(There's a flood in your heart love)?<br/>
Girl, let me pop up in your hot tub<br/>
Every night every day,<br/>
Sippin' on a different drink<br/>
Different chicks, different tastes<br/>
I do it different ways<br/>
<br/>
Where you goin?<br/>
Whatcha say?<br/>
I'm why her river flowin'<br/>
To another lake<br/>
By to ocean by the ocean<br/>
On the beach on the beach<br/>
I'm bout' to take a swim<br/>
<br/>
Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat<br/>
I wanna make you sweat<br/>
I just wanna make you sweat<br/>
I wanna make you sweat<br/>
Sweat, sweat<br/>
<br/>
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip<br/>
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
