<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>

This one goes out to all you muthafuckers out there<br/>
That didn't think we could make records that could bang in the club<br/>
Ya that's right<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Wiggle it round c'mon down<br/>

<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>

<i>[Mr. Kane]</i><br/>
I slap bitches in the face and give em Jay-Z lips<br/>
Make them sign their life off so they can pay me chips<br/>
I cut hoes so much I should sell band aids<br/>
Give bitches sandwiches with handmade mayonnaise<br/>
I put bitches on the stroll hall<br/>
Plus I control hoes like remote control suped remote controlled cars<br/>
Code blow hoe on 'em like the internet<br/>
Got my dick in her neck and ain't even took her to dinner yet<br/>
Fuck that I ain't taken her to dinner<br/>
I'll bring her to a diner get behind and go up in her<br/>
You fuckin' with losers<br/>
I'm a winner I'm gone in summer hot in the winter<br/>
Fuck hungry I'm ready for dinner HA!<br/>
Bitches don't know the low<br/>
'Bout to slap your ass off the endo smoke<br/>
I'm in the club straight goin' for broke<br/>
Sellin' bitches everything even low key dope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Don't you wanna get nasty<br/>
I like it when you freak that ass<br/>
36-24-36 shaped like an hourglass<br/>
??<br/>
Let me rub up on that clit it feels so nice and soft<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Coast to coast we do-si-dos<br/>
And get your day started like a breakfast toast<br/>
Me and my niggas make beats for your strokes<br/>
Heat for your tokes, baby tees for your chokes, keys for your ?<br/>
Me squeezin' your folks<br/>
When they come through<br/>
With their noses flarin' out like they be on that coke<br/>
Nah we on that dope<br/>
Now she wanna go cause she wanna know<br/>
How did we walk through the front door<br/>
Your pants down straight VIP<br/>
Well when it comes to rap styles, and rap crowns, and mack downs<br/>
Just mingle, we straight smack down<br/>
We so OG this here gonna be<br/>
If you with it you can have a little hit off me<br/>
Get nasty, get freaky, get busy o-so-off the hizzy
