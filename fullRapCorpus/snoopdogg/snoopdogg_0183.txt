<i>[gun cocks]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire<br/>
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor<br/>
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors<br/>
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders<br/>
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset<br/>
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet<br/>
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet<br/>
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall<br/>
Tonight it's goin down like free fall<br/>
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw<br/>
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw<br/>
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all<br/>
Doing that shit to demean Dogg<br/>
But when I bring it to you, you be like "What you mean Dogg?"<br/>
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong<br/>
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!<br/>
But that's one thing about this shit partner<br/>
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers<br/>
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?<br/>
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?<br/>
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind<br/>
Pop a beam like a M&amp;M<br/>
So strong yet a nigga thin<br/>
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem<br/>
So fuck you, him, and him<br/>
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in<br/>
No facade, I went from the yard<br/>
to a three-car garage to, instant menage it's<br/>
vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise<br/>
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless<br/>
And thats what I'm supposed to think<br/>
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink<br/>
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill<br/>
Pushin 40's still a big deal<br/>
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided<br/>
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded<br/>
Nigga! So buzz on that shit<br/>
Backflip back to plaque shit<br/>
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green<br/>
I send a whole motherfuckin team to clap shit<br/>
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist<br/>
Fuck this rap shit! <i>[gun blasts]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Shots fired<br/>
Suspect down<br/>
Request EMT immediately <i>[ambulance siren]</i>
