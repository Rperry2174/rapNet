<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Look out the window and drank and chill out we get high!<br/>
It's 1 A.M. and the crowd is still live<br/>
Relax to the groove by me just move with ya' boy<br/>
Got shit poppin' like always you know so enjoy<br/>
Dont make yourself at home got big meat on the grill<br/>
Ladies and homies all in the mix its time to chill<br/>
Char-La-La brought the on' what is asked in the blunts<br/>
Roll up some Bob Marley joints some skunk datz tight<br/>
And Nate got a hundred piece<br/>
So we piece so properly on the O.C<br/>
We in the zone bombed out feelin' good j'ya know<br/>
Got the homegirls and homies from the hood j'ya know<br/>
2-1, 1-9, 2-0<br/>
We all in the house and it's a Long Beach thang<br/>
Where I was born and hungout<br/>
To all my players and hustlers and gangbangers listen up<br/>
It's about time I kick a rhyme to fuck shit up<br/>
Now who throws shit?<br/>
<br/>

Now the party is bumpin', thumpin' back to back<br/>
And Daz on the turntable puttin' down a scratch<br/>
I'm on the mic so I'mma bust me a rap<br/>
And I'm a dedicate this one to a crack of hoodrats<br/>
The Dogg Pound nation Lex and Big Pac-sy<br/>
These is the peoples I see rockin' the party<br/>
Ever they go gonna pop-lock on the flo'<br/>
Well do the Boogaloo shrimp and pimp the ho<br/>
I got to owe em' my life cuz I'm a O.G<br/>
I got the love in the hood cuz I'm livin' homie<br/>
I got the seals when it comes to rockin rhymes<br/>
So put ya fists up to the side it's yours I got mines<br/>
Now everything is live dont you agree?<br/>
And if you do then he gon' move it with the nigga D-O-Double G<br/>
We ridin' with the hat to the side when we ride<br/>
Ya'll know how we do on the Eastside<br/>
You see this thing is we like to keep it harder<br/>
And for real party people just like Afro Pimp and Wadda<br/>
What do you want?<br/>
Matter fact what do you need?<br/>
Cuz we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint<br/>
So pass the bottle ain't no need to squabble<br/>
And hand it to the little homie let him have a swallow<br/>
It's a Eastside thang nigga bring yo ass<br/>
G's up Ho's down nigga you know the program<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
(So watch ya clock)<br/>
The clock tickin'<br/>
But it won't stop tickin' cuz everybody kickin' it<br/>
We gettin' at the bitches, witches<br/>
The main thing gangstas do<br/>
Skip the bump cuz the rumps what I came to view<br/>
New pussy in the hood shall I kill it? (Kill It!)<br/>
The way she got it poppin' oh its probably hotter than a skillet<br/>
But baby dont tweek like you ain't no freak<br/>
Peep I keep my game tight it ain't no leaks so we<br/>
Can keep this on the down low<br/>
And take a walk with the dog and lemme show you what the pound for<br/>
Candle lightin romancin'<br/>
If I can just get the last dance in<br/>
<br/>
