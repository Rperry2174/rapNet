I don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, children<br/>
I don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, uh-uh<br/>
I don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, cause<br/>
Ain’t nobody got time for that<br/>
Ain’t nobody got time for that<br/>
Ain’t nobody got, Ain’t nobody got<br/>
Ain’t nobody got time for that<br/>
<br/>
Real shit mane, no matter where you from<br/>
The same rules and regulations apply, the G code<br/>
<br/>
I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I’m real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I’m affiliated<br/>
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood<br/>
<br/>
All I bang is that crip shit, trip this<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg with my cousin Trick Trick<br/>
Put the hammer to your bisquick to your biscuit<br/>
Jam with the jelly sellin’ grams at the telly<br/>
On the telly with the plinug<br/>
If you really want it come and get it on the Dinnub<br/>
20 gang, for life, all my niggas locked down<br/>
Know I got em’ right<br/>
Its a new game, Its a new day<br/>
We even got homies in Akron and OK-C<br/>
And I'm the <i>[?]</i> Go and see em'<br/>
Holla at a nigga on the DM<br/>
All I know is to bang the beach, (long beach)<br/>
40 years nigga, bangin’ the east<br/>
And I can’t stop and I won’t stop<br/>
Even though I got a grill, still 20 crip nigga<br/>
<br/>
I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I’m real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I’m affiliated<br/>
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated<br/>
<br/>
Shit<br/>
Pull up, get out, hood up, sit down<br/>
No need to stand, he is the man<br/>
It is I, he, King, NFZ, so my thrown, a no fly zone<br/>
To make sure they mail they’re check, fly down LAX<br/>
To see my big cuz, fuck y’all thought this shit was<br/>
Turn a couple corners, big homies’ll pull up on ya<br/>
What we finna’ do what the move is<br/>
Cuz say the money where the booth is<br/>
Go and show the motherfuckers where the truth is<br/>
Hold up cuz I do this, state to state face to face<br/>
Straight up G shit, 7 mile nigga with the 21 east clique<br/>
Love my neighbors, season floor seats Pistons and Lakers<br/>
<br/>
I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I’m real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I’m affiliated<br/>
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated<br/>
<br/>
State to State, Oh<br/>
<br/>
I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I’m real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I’m affiliated<br/>
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated<br/>
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated
