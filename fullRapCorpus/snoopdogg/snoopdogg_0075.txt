<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Let cho' mind not be confused<br/>
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes<br/>
New fools, you fools, these fools, all y'all<br/>
talkin bad about me, and my motherfuckin dawg<br/>
He ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, but y'all niggaz still dissin<br/>
To me, some of these suckers'll never get it<br/>
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip<br/>
and DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin<br/>
Who the villain, you the villain?  Nigga Ren is "The Villain"<br/>
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chillin<br/>
Now as time flies by I see the game gettin mo' reala<br/>
as I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?<br/>
I always tend to come widdit<br/>
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it<br/>
I'm too young to retire, I'm havin fun wit it<br/>
See when you learn what to do with it, I'll be done with it<br/>
Come with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: KoKane, Snoop]</i><br/>
Go.. (just go away).. go a-way!<br/>
<i>[S]</i> Niggaz can't be trusted<br/>
<i>[K]</i> Just come back another day<br/>
<i>[S]</i> Niggaz be on bitch shit<br/>
<i>[K]</i> Just go far, a-way<br/>
<i>[S]</i> Niggaz get it twisted<br/>
Just go a-way..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now she said she don't like a G<br/>
Well listen here bitch, get the fuck from 'round me<br/>
You thought you was bout to get a drink on me?<br/>
I put hands on you bitch like Suga Free<br/>
I always let a bitch know her boundaries<br/>
Same with a nigga, I treat him like a flea<br/>
You claim to be, you aim to be in my spot<br/>
Motherfucker - you will get popped (BLAOW)<br/>
Not, knowin who you fuckin wit, niggaz be on bitch shit<br/>
Nigga we be fuckin quick, nigga we ain't talkin shit<br/>
When the heat speak, niggaz be on bitch shit<br/>
Tryin to get somewhere, coverin up they biscuit<br/>
And then he in the club, all up on my dilznick<br/>
But when I leave, you niggaz pullin trick shit<br/>
But it's cool, cause niggaz gonna miss this<br/>
Cause I'ma keep it all business, what is this?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I said let yo' mind not be confused<br/>
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes<br/>
You fools, these fools, new fools, all y'all<br/>
talkin bad about me, and my motherfuckin dawg<br/>
He ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, but y'all niggaz still dissin<br/>
Look here Meech, some of these niggaz'll never get it<br/>
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip<br/>
and DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin<br/>
Who the villain, you the villain?  Nigga Ren is "The Villain"<br/>
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chillin<br/>
Now as time fly I see the game gettin mo' reala<br/>
as I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?<br/>
I always tend to come widdit<br/>
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it<br/>
Too young to retire, I'm havin fun wit it<br/>
When you learn what to do with it I'll be done with it<br/>
Come with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yeah I'm bout to go far away<br/>
So far you might not see me<br/>
My nigga Meech on the beat<br/>
We takin over this motherfucker, ha ha!<br/>
And they thought we fell off<br/>
Fell all up in your motherfuckin ass<br/>
Be-ii-ee-ii-itch!<br/>
KoKane - aww that's funky right there<br/>
Puttin it back on the map<br/>
Uhh, let me hear some dawg<br/>
Ahhh, as we take your mind<br/>
to a dimension you never thought existed<br/>
<br/>
