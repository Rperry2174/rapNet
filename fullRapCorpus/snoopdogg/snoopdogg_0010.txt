<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick<br/>
On W-Balls, right now, somethin new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg<br/>
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys<br/>
A big bow wow wow, cuz we gonna make it a little mystery <br/>
here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that<br/>
slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
When I met you last night baby<br/>
Before you opened up your gap<br/>
I had respect for ya lady<br/>
But now I take it all back<br/>
Cause you gave me all your pussy<br/>
And ya even licked my balls<br/>
Leave your number on the cabinet<br/>
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call<br/>
Next time I'm feelin kinda horny<br/>
You can come on over, and I'll break you off<br/>
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby<br/>
Just lay back, and open your mouth<br/>
Cause I have never <br/>
met a girl<br/>
That I love <br/>
in the whole wide world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Kurupt]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke<br/>
I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke<br/>
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me<br/>
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?<br/>
I have no love for hoes<br/>
That's somethin I learned in the pound<br/>
so how the fuck am I supposed<br/>
to pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe<br/>
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times<br/>
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it<br/>
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it<br/>
Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me<br/>
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me<br/>
i gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention<br/>
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt<br/>
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:  (repeat 4X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Guess who back in the motherfuckin house<br/>
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth<br/>
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too<br/>
Cuz when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo<br/>
What you gon do?  You really don't know<br/>
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe<br/>
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch<br/>
Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip<br/>
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger<br/>
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop<br/>
Doggy, I'm all the above<br/>
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes<br/>
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it<br/>
Cause you know I don't love em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four:  Warren G]</i><br/>
<br/>
Whoa!<br/>
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow<br/>
One for the money, two for the btiches<br/>
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches<br/>
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact<br/>
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back<br/>
So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get<br/>
off your knees and then start jugglin<br/>
these motherfuckin nuts in your mouth<br/>
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout<br/>
Whoo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
