<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Like a hon mama work just trying to get by (hey yea)<br/>
And enough get to you so they still want no get no bly (he he he)<br/>
Just keep on the hustle 'cause we have to stay pon the grind (he he yea)<br/>
Don't give up on yo dreams 'cause you know the sun will shine (he he he)<br/>
The sun will shine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm tired in the morning, too late at night<br/>
See mama scraping for nickles and dimes<br/>
On the salary she's making we can barely survive<br/>
Tell me is these something greater in this life?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Wait, said mama<br/>
Patience, said mama<br/>
Breaking down is not an option<br/>
Make it happen somehow<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
How much more can my mama take?<br/>
Now I've got to step up to the play<br/>
Can't afford to make mistakes<br/>
Ain't no time to waste<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
To hold in since, damn I make it so hard<br/>
From California straight to New York<br/>
From Chicago going straight to her yard<br/>
People everywhere, them everywhere, can I stry?<br/>
Can't get a piece so be fly your body borderline<br/>
Everywhere I go them facing much harder times<br/>
They know the grass feel greener pon the other side<br/>
But me still want see one we can't find<br/>
<br/>
