<i>[helicopter flying overhead]</i><br/>
This is Angela Sanders coming to you live<br/>
from the scene of yet another murder mystery<br/>
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered<br/>
We have no information at this time<br/>
<i>[journalist speaks in spanish (I won't be insulting and try to transcribe it)]</i><br/>
<i>[lightning cracks]</i><br/>
<i>[helicopter passes by again]</i><br/>
<br/>
As I look up, at the sky<br/>
My mind starts trippin, a tear drops my eye<br/>
My body temperature falls<br/>
I'm shakin, and they breakin, tryin to save the Dogg<br/>
Pumpin on my chest and I'm screamin<br/>
I stop breathin, damn I see deamons<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me<br/>
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby<br/>
I think it's too late for prayin, hold up<br/>
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin<br/>
"Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"<br/>
And how long will I live?<br/>
"Eternal life and forever"<br/>
And will I be, the G that I was?<br/>
"I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of<br/>
So relax your soul, let me take control<br/>
Close your eyes my son"<br/>
My eyes are closed<br/>
<br/>
Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me" <i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm fresh up out my coma<br/>
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner<br/>
It's gonna take a miracle they say<br/>
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway<br/>
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet<br/>
And everything that nigga said, came to reality<br/>
Livin like a baller loc<br/>
I'm havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke<br/>
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag<br/>
And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad<br/>
"Just remember who changed your mind<br/>
Cuz when you start set-trippin, that ass is mine"<br/>
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed<br/>
Never have a want, never have a need<br/>
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'<br/>
Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe (check it out)<br/>
<br/>
Now I lay me down to sleep<br/>
I pray the lord, my soul to keep<br/>
If I should die, before I wake<br/>
I pray the lord, my soul to take<br/>
<br/>
Murder was the case that they gave me<br/>
"Murder was the case that they gave me" <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
No more indo, gin and juice<br/>
I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose<br/>
Shackled from head to toe<br/>
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know<br/>
them niggaz from the other side recognize my face<br/>
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C<br/>
Mad doggin niggaz cuz I don't care<br/>
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair<br/>
Niggaz stare as I enter the center<br/>
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay <br/>
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor<br/>
Niggaz gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off<br/>
Cause you can't tell what's next<br/>
My little homey Baby Boo he took a pencil in his neck<br/>
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two<br/>
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo<br/>
<br/>
Murder... "murder was the case that they gave me" <i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
