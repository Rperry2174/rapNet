<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
When you're awake<br/>
When lightening strikes you know<br/>
When you're awake<br/>
It definitely starts glowing<br/>
All the girls that's in this room<br/>
Get up close, you'll feel so much better<br/>
It feels so good to know<br/>
When you're awake<br/>
With the G come to the light<br/>
<br/>
Put your hands together and close your eyes<br/>
Smell the aroma, visualise<br/>
Do not try to get higher than me<br/>
Why stop it there? Get high as can be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus - Pharrell Williams:]</i><br/>
It's time to spark up some <i>[?]</i><br/>
Feel the blaze<br/>
The <i>[?]</i> number one (there's nothing new under the sun)<br/>
Feel the awake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
My name is Snoop Dogg, not to complain<br/>
I gets my groove on, I do my thing<br/>
My planet's Krypton, home of the freaks<br/>
Come get your moon rocks, I am a G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
