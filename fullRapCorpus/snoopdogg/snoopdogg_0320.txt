<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Yeah, man<br/>
Do you ever sit and wonder sometimes<br/>
What if?<br/>
I mean, like, forreal though<br/>
I mean, sometimes I just sit and think to myself, like<br/>
What if?<br/>
I mean, that's a big question, right?<br/>
If "if" was a fifth, we'd all be fucked up<br/>
But what I really wanna know is:<br/>
What if?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Suga Free:]</i><br/>
(What if?)<br/>
We had a reckless motherfucker<br/>
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg<br/>
(What if?)<br/>
We never had a nigga like Big P<br/>
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"<br/>
(What if?)<br/>
We never had a real woman<br/>
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was<br/>
(What if?)<br/>
We had to take it<br/>
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it<br/>
<br/>
Social media only ask the he-say, she-say shit<br/>
And where would I be without Tone, Pimp <i>[?]</i> and DJ Quik?<br/>
Act like you knew that<br/>
I'm glad I had somebody tell me<br/>
"Don't think with your dick, boy. Don't do that!"<br/>
Come on, you know me, man<br/>
I pimp on, I entertain, man<br/>
That's why I stay inside my <i>[?]</i> lane<br/>
I gotta be careful when I show you stuff<br/>
Cause these haters don't like you if you know too much<br/>
Yo, ow give it up if you like this<br/>
And you prefer the peace<br/>
And won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with<br/>
We pull the cards around a phony<br/>
My sister told me, "Niggas act hard around they homies"<br/>
Because the West don't need no beef<br/>
We need our <i>[?]</i> and our roaches<br/>
And our Reres and our Monique<br/>
So stay prayed up, armor on, I got it<br/>
What if you talked to that man<br/>
And understood before you shot him?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
(What if?)<br/>
The Bloods and the Crips was the same<br/>
And all niggas joined one gang<br/>
(What if?)<br/>
My granny wouldn't have died<br/>
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side<br/>
(What if?)<br/>
You could do what you don't<br/>
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that<br/>
(What if?)<br/>
A phony is a phony, a homie is a homie<br/>
And you know the big homie don't play that<br/>
<br/>
Catch him, stick him<br/>
Rip it, ride it<br/>
La di da di, we shout out the party<br/>
The old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me<br/>
You better off tryna do you<br/>
Boo hoo, voodoo, taboo<br/>
DP, GC, what it really do?<br/>
I educate when I illustrate<br/>
And those the words I be teachin', preachin'<br/>
To each and everyone<br/>
Never been a scary one<br/>
Always been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga<br/>
Reppin' my city, <i>[?]</i><br/>
Extra extraordinaire exceptionally<br/>
Never late, predicate, elevate, levitate<br/>
My nigga, I'm way too high to ever hate<br/>
Papa Snoop in my momma Beverly, heavenly<br/>
Thank God for ya'll havin' me, for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg &amp; Suga Free:]</i><br/>
(What if?)<br/>
The Bloods and the Crips was the same<br/>
