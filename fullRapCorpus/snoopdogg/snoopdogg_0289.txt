<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Yea man, I heard you wasn't gonna do it no more<br/>
They said it was overwith for you<br/>
Overwith? shit nigga I ain't going nowhere<br/>
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere<br/>
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Snoop Dogg this is me<br/>
Back up in the place to be<br/>
I walk a bit, I blaze a jay<br/>
I talk some shit, hey hey hey hey<br/>
I'm going at baby<br/>
Listen close we gon' dream<br/>
And we gon' toast, this that year<br/>
When things was bad this that time<br/>
When I'm gon' smash getting cash<br/>
Is all I know, I think the year was '94<br/>
Or was it later really don't matter<br/>
Cause I gets cheese, I gets cheddar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
Funny style, funny niggas<br/>
Funny style, funny niggas<br/>
Funny style, Kurupt in the building<br/>
They funny style, aye Snoop<br/>
Punk motherfuckers in disguise I can tell<br/>
Soon as I see them when I rise in the spot<br/>
Gotti in the building everybody realized<br/>
Looking in my eyes niggas is surprised<br/>
What the fuck is cracking don't they know what's happening?<br/>
The next time this nigga get close, clap him<br/>
This nigga like a bitch moving so slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Just bring the beat back and let the shit bang<br/>
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I came to bang<br/>
I don't come to play I come to drop heat<br/>
And niggas like you get dusted in the streets<br/>
You just try to rap about what you know<br/>
And I'm gonna keep this shit way on the low<br/>
Me man my clique me and my crew<br/>
We come through this bitch and banging on you<br/>
You think you can fuck with us<br/>
But I don't think you'll fuck with us<br/>
See we the shit DPGC<br/>
For 20 years and thats all me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
Bitch, run through the spot<br/>
Tipping the hit<br/>
Run and get all my money nigga I get<br/>
The bitches they love me and they stay on my dick<br/>
I'm rolling with dabs, little half <i>[?]</i><br/>
Me and big Snoop getting that bread<br/>
Make them pussy lips spread<br/>
Bitches is crazy, they all on my dick<br/>
Loving my Mercedes what up bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I'mma show you motherfuckers whats a poster G<br/>
And let me get these niggas close to me<br/>
You can size me up, you can picture the frame<br/>
You can study my style you can write down my name<br/>
You can change up the beat and you can slow this shit down<br/>
You can try to get close but this is still Dogg Pound<br/>
We be fuckin it up, we be smoking the dope<br/>
We be on the tour bus from coast to coast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
Got all my money, all my hoes<br/>
Every corner, all my hoes<br/>
All my homies, all my souls<br/>
Like what's crackin, and they know<br/>
In a second niggas get hit then it's over<br/>
Look look, why these niggas trippin all over<br/>
In the spot with my homies deep with heaters<br/>
Looking at these suckers pulling out they millimeters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
So y'all should know when you stepped up<br/>
You got fucked up and that's what's up<br/>
See this is true we gray and blue<br/>
DPGC I thought you knew
