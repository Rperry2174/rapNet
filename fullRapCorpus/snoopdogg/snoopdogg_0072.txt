<i>[repeat x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Me and my partner, in my impala<br/>
Poppin' on collars, tossing up dollars<br/>
A truck on the side of us but who wanna follow<br/>
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow<br/>
Doggy Doggfather<br/>
I do it to you real hard then it gets hot, it's nada<br/>
Thang on mine, bang on mine<br/>
I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time<br/>
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfucking bimbo<br/>
So quit knocking at my window, you nympho<br/>
Maniac, bring it back, now shake it up<br/>
Put it on the table, now break it up<br/>
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it<br/>
It really don't matter what you spent on it<br/>
As long as you're gettin what you paid for<br/>
That's what it's made for, ain't that what you stayed for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac?<br/>
Snoop Dogg<br/>
Smoke till your eyes get cataracts<br/>
Snoop Dogg<br/>
Who got a girl laying on her back<br/>
Snoop Dogg<br/>
Millionaire, making that paper stack<br/>
Snoop Dogg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
You play me and I'll play you<br/>
You pay me and I'll pay you<br/>
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong<br/>
This ain't your thang, this my song<br/>
Move on, we in the club, at the Shark Bar<br/>
Valet my keys, and park my car<br/>
No snap shots, cause I might get popped<br/>
As I slide by security, giving 'em props<br/>
First thing I do, when I get in<br/>
Let me take you back to when I first slid in<br/>
Grab my gin and, get my woman, put my bib in, no bullshittin<br/>
We be sippin, in the corner<br/>
With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin in the sauna<br/>
Burnin' up the charts, break a bitch off hard<br/>
Little mama don't you start<br/>
<br/>

<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Tick tock, the ice on my watch<br/>
Slap me 'cross the face around 2 o'clock<br/>
But the party don't stop till we blow up<br/>
Now every little nigga wanna show up<br/>
Manuev'in to this, grooving to this<br/>
Dippin to this, flippin to this, trippin to this<br/>
Ain't no skippin to this, trust this<br/>
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this<br/>
He say, she say, I say no way<br/>
Don't need foreplay, OK, obey<br/>
Everything that I say<br/>
And every day'll be like a holiday<br/>
I put you in the front seat of my car<br/>
And roll you round town like a superstar<br/>
Recline your seat and turn up the beat<br/>
Number one with a bullet, rolling down the motherfucking backstreets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus x2]</i><br/>
