<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We're having a good day<br/>
Let's make it a great night<br/>
You know I see you<br/>
And .. so tight<br/>
My special lady<br/>
You're one of a kind<br/>
And every time I see you shine<br/>
It's like the lights of midnight<br/>
On New Year's Eve<br/>
And I do believe<br/>
On New Year's Eve<br/>
We can make it<br/>
We can live forever<br/>
<br/>
11:59 and not a second later<br/>
She's stayin' in the mix like a crossfader<br/>
It's about to go down<br/>
No elevator<br/>
Live for the moment<br/>
Love in the air<br/>
She got me feeling like<br/>
I don't wanna be your player<br/>
Real talk<br/>
So I don't wanna be unfair<br/>
Now watch the apple drop<br/>
And celebrate the year<br/>
I see you shinin' away<br/>
From over there<br/>
And all the other girls<br/>
No, they don't compare<br/>
I whisper something bond to you<br/>
<br/>
.. in your ear<br/>
I infiltrate your mind<br/>
And then I penetrate her<br/>
I get it crackin' baby<br/>
Call me the .. lady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We're having a good day<br/>
Let's make it a great night<br/>
You know I see you<br/>
And .. so tight<br/>
My special lady<br/>
You're one of a kind<br/>
And every time I see you shine<br/>
It's like the lights of midnight<br/>
On New Year's Eve<br/>
And I do believe<br/>
On New Year's Eve<br/>
We can make it<br/>
We can live forever<br/>
Grab a glass<br/>
Make a toast to the good life<br/>
Recorded line, so what?<br/>
It will pass the time<br/>
Leather seats in the back of a Phantom ride<br/>
You stay on my mind so I had to make you mine<br/>
Master .. for a master mind<br/>
My special lady<br/>
Only one of a kind<br/>
I never seen it comin'<br/>
I guess love is blind<br/>
New Year â€¦ come to life<br/>
I must say girl<br/>
You're looking right<br/>
Your hair, nails, dress<br/>
Fitting tight<br/>
I think I just might<br/>
Says here's the one I like<br/>
See we can look forever girl<br/>
Let's be .. tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We're having a good day<br/>
Let's make it a great night<br/>
You know I see you<br/>
And .. so tight<br/>
My special lady<br/>
You're one of a kind<br/>
And every time I see you shine<br/>
It's like the lights of midnight<br/>
On New Year's Eve<br/>
And I do believe<br/>
On New Year's Eve<br/>
We can make it<br/>
We can live forever
