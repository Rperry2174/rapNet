<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Well it's the super duper Snoopa once again I'm on the fly<br/>
Swoopin through I'm in my coupe and all the bitches want a ride<br/>
If it's trippin like I'm clippin I'm still grippin on my nine<br/>
We be Crip'n while I'm dippin with my C's up in the sky<br/>
And the East is still my side, I'm a reaper when I ride<br/>
Fuck a feature, I don't need a motherfucker, I'm the guy<br/>
I delete 'em, stampede 'em, straight eat 'em like some fries<br/>
Get a ketchup, get 'em messed up, turn the heat up let 'em fry<br/>
Ain't no different when I'm rippin, pimpin's still up in his prime<br/>
TV shows, movie hoes, pimpin's still up on his grind<br/>
Man these hoes don't know, I'm workin with a nine<br/>
I ain't talkin 'bout a gun, I'm talkin feel it in your spine<br/>
when I hit it from behind, if I go up in your mouth<br/>
I might hit you in the mind, you know what I'm talkin 'bout<br/>
It'll thrill ya, I'm the stealer that'll kill ya with the rhythm of a trigger<br/>
Motherfucker better duck before I hit her, bang!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Dogg-y Dogg, is all, you need<br/>
So love, the Dogg, like we, love weed<br/>
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out<br/>
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out<br/>
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out<br/>
(Breathe in) Breathe in (breathe out) let it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You niggaz mad cause I done came and crept up back up on the scene<br/>
This is bye, retire, I'm still spittin gasoline<br/>
I'm a gangsta motherfucker what the fuck you think that means?<br/>
Little nigga I'm the king, I ain't givin up a thing<br/>
If you want it come and take it nigga, I'll be sittin waitin<br/>
Make a patient nigga got the other ear and I'll bake a nigga<br/>
Fuck it put the gun down, and straight bank a nigga<br/>
Take it nigga, take it nigga fuck, you ain't this nigga<br/>
.. Slow down my turbo flow<br/>
.. Inhale my doe-doe smoke<br/>
.. Okay I let the fo'-fo' blow<br/>
And the po-po know, that's why they on my dick<br/>
And they at my crib, tryin to find my shit<br/>
Tryin to search my house, what the fuck that's 'bout?<br/>
I ain't givin up shit, you can search that bitch<br/>
I ain't got nuttin Jack; get the fuck on back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i>
