(...sleeping at night<br/>
I have visions of you<br/>
I make believe we’re running away<br/>
To a world of fantasy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kali Uchis:]</i><br/>
Let me <i>[?]</i> something that has seemed to got my mind for this<br/>
Early in the morning, and I'm cruising down to your address<br/>
Fucking up my intellect, but you know I'm into it<br/>
Nobody can stop me, maybe you should join my syndicate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kali Uchis:]</i><br/>
On edge, on edge, why are you so on edge, on edge, on edge<br/>
You should get closer, closer, like you're supposed to, supposed to!<br/>
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on it on it<br/>
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to, supposed to!<br/>
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on edge<br/>
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to!<br/>
May we turn the time back?<br/>
Riding in, my time machine<br/>
No, I don't need the Maybach<br/>
And we're riding dirty, but I didn't need to say that<br/>
I don't know this girl, but she's claiming that we go way back!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Denise, Latrice, none to say the least<br/>
I'm feeling like an interview, I really don't remember you!<br/>
Sigh, aye bae, what you're feeling dude?<br/>
I'm running that bind trying to get into you<br/>
They call me Mr. Rich Roller<br/>
We say, he say, baby you a chola<br/>
Swole up, mix the Hennessey with Cola<br/>
Lil momma, hold up, now baby, put the gold up!<br/>
Yeah, lil momma <i>[?]</i> she mix the molly with meds<br/>
And now she probably on edge<br/>
Uh, see, ain't no selling it dog<br/>
I put the pale on the log, see ain't no telling involved<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kali Uchis:]</i><br/>
On edge, on edge, why are you so on edge, on edge, on edge<br/>
You should get closer, closer, like you're supposed to, supposed to!<br/>
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on it on it<br/>
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to, supposed to!<br/>
On edge, on edge, baby, I'm on edge<br/>
You should get closer, closer like you're supposed to!<br/>
May we turn the time back?<br/>
Riding in, my time machine<br/>
No, I don't need the Maybach<br/>
And we're riding dirty, but I didn't need to say that<br/>
I don't know this girl, but she's claiming that we go way back!<br/>
<br/>
On edge, on edge, why are you so on edge, on edge, on edge<br/>
You should get closer, closer, like you're supposed to, supposed to!<br/>
<br/>
