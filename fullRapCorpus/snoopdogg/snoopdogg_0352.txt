Midnight love, midnight love, midnight love, midnight love, ohhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Raphael Saadiq:]</i><br/>
Midnight love<br/>
Troubles plots on thee mind<br/>
Midnight love<br/>
Leave your back door open<br/>
Midnight love<br/>
This heaven's ready for me<br/>
Midnight love<br/>
Back door little druggie's callin for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I'm makin things happen fast<br/>
Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along<br/>
Face lookin stupid broke startin<br/>
Feelin dumb, I'm young but I'm a grown man<br/>
Takin thangs into my own hands<br/>
I'm tryin to own here<br/>
But life a twist ya like a twister<br/>
Get twisted with this<br/>
It seems on but its off<br/>
I keep missin this shit<br/>
I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide eyed<br/>
Lookin dead at the chips<br/>
I blink they dip<br/>
Its hard to hang on but I can't let go<br/>
Smokin on my last breath<br/>
Blow out life whats left is death<br/>
Now I can go on or I can G or make a right<br/>
Whatever way that I turn its still death after life<br/>
It don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin to lose<br/>
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn<br/>
But I learn cuz I see, and I earn cuz I G<br/>
But these problems probably havin niggas prayin to see<br/>
At an early age so at an early stage in life<br/>
I chose to get my ish tight ya gotta struggle and fight<br/>
It cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees<br/>
And I'm tryin to keep my sanity God help me please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Mischeavius and devious is how my life was<br/>
Puttin the serve down for cabbage just to keep the niggas buzzed<br/>
Some of the money makin muthafuckaz from the other side<br/>
Was thinkin about a jack move tryin to whoo-ride<br/>
Gettin jealous cuz my niggas got this rap game sewn up<br/>
Them niggas wanna trip whatever back they get blowed up<br/>
Blown up or not you can still get shot<br/>
You don't never play those muthafuckaz I'll always not<br/>
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit<br/>
Don't be fuckin wit my niggas on the midnight shift<br/>
Shit shiggy shack, gettin it on, to the break of dawn<br/>
Now he's known for servin more than an oz. so<br/>
He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin chest<br/>
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest<br/>
He's lookin for the music from the night before<br/>
Trouble 1, he layin low all in a nigga backdo'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz:]</i><br/>
Now its all about the dollars<br/>
Impalas that bounce<br/>
Havin cars and bitches on a proper amount<br/>
Caught a million chillin<br/>
Robbin banks for many muthaz son<br/>
Life and darkness<br/>
We all get it started, cold hearted<br/>
All around it my life won't change for the good<br/>
As soon as I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood<br/>
Daz, would you come and ride for me<br/>
Hey yo Daz would you soldier would you would you and die for me<br/>
The tradition's got a lot of niggas killin for dumb shit<br/>
The OGs think they bring guns to young'ns to control shit<br/>
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite<br/>
Besides with the drama the dog fight street fight<br/>
And a lot a mob puttin on mo<br/>
Problems solved, but revolved whatever with a fo-fo<br/>
But sure I did the record blast five times<br/>
254 sentence to jail time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raphael Saadiq:]</i><br/>
Midnight love<br/>
I've been walkin the street<br/>
Midnight love<br/>
I put my life on the line<br/>
Midnight love<br/>
Cuz I've just gotta be me<br/>
Midnight love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
