<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah, make some motherfuckin noise<br/>
Yo Doggy Dogg you're on, live on stage<br/>
Performin tonight, excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on<br/>
YOU KNOW! The one and only<br/>
Don Corleone, the big homey y'know me<br/>
<br/>
Well if it's on I guess it's bout time<br/>
Let me slide into this OG rhyme<br/>
I do mine the way I do mine<br/>
and I takes my time when I'm droppin my lines<br/>
I look around, I spot MC's (and they)<br/>
all in the place (and they) all wannabe's<br/>
Tryin ta make their paper, tryin to do their thang<br/>
but to me they all tryin to say the same thang<br/>
How could you rap over *?be said what?*<br/>
You ain't reachin the crowd, you ain't makin your fact<br/>
You ain't droppin lines that hit the top<br/>
You can't make the party go hip-hop<br/>
abd you can't do your thing without usin mine<br/>
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind<br/>
but I'ma take my time to get my point across<br/>
and if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost<br/>
and if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault<br/>
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song<br/>
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on<br/>
then I do mines to do mines and I'ma keep on, keep on, keep on<br/>
to get'cha you in a...smooth type of atmosphere<br/>
Sit back and pay attention yeah<br/>
You ain't never heard it like that<br/>
Uhh, is that right? That's right black<br/>
but uhh,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Sixx minutes (sixx minutes), sixx minutes (sixx minutes)<br/>
Sixx minutes Doggy Dogg you're on<br/>
Uh uh on, uh uh on<br/>
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
I gets my hair whipped on Friday, my day, why they<br/>
even trippin on me? Yeah the big homey<br/>
Gamey Gamey says "Snoop Corleone<br/>
listen to me man, stay away from them phoneys<br/>
It's niggas like that that get you caught up quick<br/>
You gots ta stay focussed Dogg, keep your eye on your grip<br/>
cos if you slip they gon' get'cha and they gon' get'cha fast<br/>
These niggas out for your money man, they tryin to get your cash"<br/>
I don't give a damn, you gots ta match<br/>
You can be from the East Coast and get love cos I ain't trippin on your ass<br/>
I don't smash on niggas who are smaller than me<br/>
I smash on niggas who big like the DPGC<br/>
Ooohwee, I get'cha crazy<br/>
You gots ta have a stomach for this shit, ba-by<br/>
And if ya don't you won't, you fake the funk<br/>
See Snoop is the G in the G-Funk<br/>
Now don't do nothin that you can't get out of me<br/>
Uh uh, you know I got big love for the real G's<br/>
We make mo' G's, I gots ta have it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got the, I got the, I got the paper<br/>
I keep ya, I keep ya, I keep ya cryin<br/>
I thought ya, I thought ya knew my nigga<br/>
Ya better, ya better ask somebody (Better ask somebody)<br/>
<br/>
Uh, it don't quit<br/>
Now let me take my time and just get into the shit<br/>
I'm just driftin, so swift and smooth<br/>
How many niggas make the whole party move like I do?<br/>
I can't name nobody<br/>
so sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party<br/>
Ain't no party like a DP party<br/>
cos everybody in the DP party's naughty<br/>
They acts a fool, old school, new school<br/>
Everything is everything, everybody playin cool<br/>
Ain't no set trippin, everybody just dippin<br/>
Bitches gettin with niggas and niggas gettin bitches<br/>
It's all superb, word to my momma<br/>
Ain't no drama, no need for that<br/>
You can put your gat back in your pocket<br/>
unlock it cos Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it<br/>
Don't stop, (excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)<br/>
<br/>
