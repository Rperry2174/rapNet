<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom<br/>
With the wheels spinnin'<br/>
Ladies like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
I'm in the back of the club<br/>
Blowin' trees<br/>
Hands up, head bobbin' like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
In the spot where the girls go wild<br/>
Dancing titty bar style<br/>
I'm like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
Snoop Dizzle (Hey)<br/>
Your boy Kells (Hey)<br/>
Let me hear you say<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Let's get this party jumpin'<br/>
Me and Kel gone get it bumpin'<br/>
They humpin'<br/>
Like when it's over<br/>
We gone all get into somethin'<br/>
The Dog is fresh<br/>
Southside without a vest<br/>
Nothin on my chest<br/>
But these ladies up out the Midwest<br/>
I must confess<br/>
That in the Chi is so blessed<br/>
Leaving nothing on my mind<br/>
But Doggy, you and safe sex<br/>
This ain't a test<br/>
You fucking with a cold mess<br/>
Meet me in Chicago<br/>
Let me get you to this real west<br/>
It's real strong<br/>
Real fat and real long<br/>
Doggies in the building<br/>
Holdin' something they can feel up on<br/>
And once they get it<br/>
Something they can build up on<br/>
Take that skinny nigga home<br/>
Work that filling till it's gone<br/>
Get that home grown<br/>
Put that shit on Daddy long<br/>
I know how you ladies do it<br/>
T-shirt with no panties on<br/>
Let's get this shit crackin'<br/>
Kell and Doggy Dogg in action<br/>
If you in here all alone<br/>
You might get this dog bone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom<br/>
With the wheels spinnin'<br/>
Ladies like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
I'm in the back of the club<br/>
Blowin' trees<br/>
Hands up, head bobbin' like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
In the spot where the girls go wild<br/>
Dancing titty bar style<br/>
I'm like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
Snoop Dizzle (Hey)<br/>
Your boy Kells (Hey)<br/>
Let me hear you say<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Dip low, Six-Four<br/>
Hundred spokes and chronic smoke<br/>
All these ladies on the floor<br/>
Cuz they know what we in here for<br/>
Dogg and Kelly came to ball<br/>
Get your ass up off the wall<br/>
Let that middle wiggle<br/>
Now make that shit fall<br/>
Not just one, but all y'all<br/>
Move it like you want it all<br/>
Let me see you bounce it for me<br/>
Work that shit for Doggy Dogg<br/>
You gots to do it<br/>
Is that your crew<br/>
Bring 'em too<br/>
Come here let me take you through it<br/>
Then once Kelly get into it<br/>
We can get this after party<br/>
Poppin' everybody<br/>
Got themselves another body<br/>
Knockin' out<br/>
Without protection though<br/>
That's my confession<br/>
But at the spot<br/>
If you just think<br/>
Your gonna listen<br/>
You can drop it like it's hot<br/>
Hold up<br/>
I came to cool out<br/>
Lay back and get blown<br/>
Maybe Henny, maybe gin<br/>
A couple shots of Patron<br/>
And if you didn't you missed it<br/>
But now it's known<br/>
That this cash shit<br/>
Kells sing that song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom<br/>
With the wheels spinnin'<br/>
Ladies like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
I'm in the back of the club<br/>
Blowin' trees<br/>
Hands up, head bobbin' like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
In the spot where the girls go wild<br/>
Dancing titty bar style<br/>
I'm like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
Snoop Dizzle (Hey)<br/>
Your boy Kells (Hey)<br/>
Let me hear you say<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
<br/>
So if you think you got the bomb shit<br/>
(Holla at a playa) <i>[X3]</i><br/>
And if you lookin' for some good sex<br/>
(Holla at a playa) <i>[X3]</i><br/>
Girl if you ever in the 3-1-2<br/>
(Holla at a playa) <i>[X3]</i><br/>
And if you're ever in the 2-1-3<br/>
(Holla at a playa) <i>[X3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom<br/>
With the wheels spinnin'<br/>
Ladies like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
I'm in the back of the club<br/>
Blowin' trees<br/>
Hands up, head bobbin' like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
In the spot where the girls go wild<br/>
Dancing titty bar style<br/>
I'm like<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
Snoop Dizzle (Hey)<br/>
Your boy Kells (Hey)<br/>
Let me hear you say<br/>
That's that shit
