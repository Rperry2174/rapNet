<i>[Snoop:]</i><br/>
GAME that's my thang<br/>
and it ain't no rules when you in this game<br/>
<i>[3X's]</i><br/>
<br/>
Gunblast <i>[gunshots]</i> echo fast and all I seen was loose cash<br/>
I hit the flo' &amp; when they go I make sure I grab all the dough<br/>
The Scene: Long Beach yeah '86 <br/>
Where: The liquor store nigga on some devilish shit<br/>
I went in to grab a drink but I came out a felon<br/>
my homeboy got away but shit I wasn't tellin'<br/>
So I fell in a trap with no getback<br/>
they threw away the key and now I'm a OG<br/>
In the County jail rappin &amp; bangin' at the same time<br/>
and since I don't smoke cigarettes loc<br/>
shit I gotta slang mine<br/>
And I ain't tryin' to get on swole so I ain't fuckin' with the iron<br/>
I got bitches bringin' me money &amp; ain't a godamn thing funny<br/>
My homeboy Devil from the HCG and Young Side Trey R.I.P<br/>
from the ETG (Eight-Trey) and oh yeah Baby Ken Dawg<br/>
from the Westside Four-O's got love for Short and my<br/>
homeboy J-Ball from the Seven four ? from that gang<br/>
and the homeboy Tracy D from<br/>

Get yo' hustle on nigga 'fore you end up dead<br/>
It's too much paper to get Can ya dig it?<br/>
Later on this evening I got a lick nigga is you down wit' it?<br/>
Shit...<br/>
<br/>
GAME that's my thang<br/>
and it ain't no rules when you in this game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Steady Mobb'n]</i><br/>
There's ten laws to the game nigga be raised by 'em all<br/>
Get ya respect on at all times nigga hustle 'til ya ball<br/>
watch them hatas and pretendas and all the shit they do<br/>
cause nowadays some of these niggas be bitches too<br/>
Keep the business professional get ya heat at all times<br/>
keep them snitches on the sideline<br/>
cause you know pressure burst the pipeline<br/>
Keep ya eyes on ya enemies watch those close to ya<br/>
See them outside niggas can't touch ya<br/>
it be the ones inside that do ya<br/>
Smilin' in ya face but want to take yo' place<br/>
fuck around and be playa let's make a deal with the D.A.<br/>
Don't be ridin' with no niggas<br/>
who ain't sure if he gon' get down<br/>
cause it only take a split second<br/>
to get ya buck buck and lay down<br/>
Hesitation'll buy ya fate get that ass all caught up<br/>
ya little homey might be cool<br/>
if them other two priors ain't brought up<br/>
Remember took time to kill smash and don't give a fuck<br/>
Be a hog about ya papers straight hungry for that der come up<br/>
Respect the game feel what the soldier talkin' about<br/>
If you got to be in that game stack ya change<br/>
and get the fuck out!<br/>
<br/>
