Ayy ayy step back motherfucker, watch out!<br/>
<i>[Gunshot]</i><br/>
La la la la la<br/>
We don't give a fuck<br/>
Ayy y'all niggas ain't fucking with us, nigga<br/>
La la la la la<br/>
Imma get it like this nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman:]</i><br/>
Yo I got the green, Don Juan<br/>
I'm in the hood, blow the horn, bom-bom<br/>
This pimpin' ain't for free, here's a coupon<br/>
My backwoods packs I turn to a futon<br/>
I got my eyes on seven figures<br/>
And I'mma get it whether I move crooked like Jack Thriller's<br/>
I'm shittin' on em, I smell like a winner<br/>
Don't hit the bathroom for like forty-forty-five minutes<br/>
Redman and we up in this bitch, huh<br/>
I never cruise, I work to be the top gun<br/>
And I'm a dog off the collar, the marijuana globe trotters<br/>
You's got bud, I holler<br/>
<br/>
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke<br/>
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke<br/>
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)<br/>
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke<br/>
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke<br/>
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B-Real:]</i><br/>
It's the four horsemen<br/>
Call for reinforcements<br/>
We ain't looking for endorsements<br/>
We absorb your portions<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Method Man:]</i><br/>
I ain't here to bring the East back (nah), I'm here to relapse<br/>
And now I'm outta rehab they ask me where the weed at<br/>
Go get a weed app (homie), I got that weed that have your P.O getting P.O, ask me where to pee at<br/>
My G, pack the streets of New York, I give em G-Rap<br/>
I'm kool, on the road to riches to get my G back<br/>
I'll be that, killer bees mind your beeswax<br/>
Past 10 o'clock when ya still don't know where your seat at<br/>
Ask big Snoop, it don't take a Crip to see that<br/>
Be real, what you read about Meth Man, believe that<br/>
I'm nice, I gots no chill, go get a ski hat<br/>
In fact, put ya twitter on ice, chill with the feedback<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
From the days of Cheech and Chong, to Willie Nelson<br/>
Everywhere that I go, I blow fo sho, you smelled it<br/>
A lot of y'all fuckin' with me, sayin' I'm on your bucket list<br/>
But I ain't the one to be fuckin' with<br/>
See, I'm like a quick game of tic-tac-toe, take three in a row<br/>
Aye lil nigga, go'n hit that door<br/>
I'm back with my niggas Earth wind, no snow<br/>
And I got the fire on Mt. Kushmore<br/>
So let it rain like the leaves of a cannabis plant<br/>
When I say it, I mean it as a matter of fact<br/>
Well I outta, slip mo dick in your daughter, for starters<br/>
Leafs by Snoop, may I take your order?<br/>
<br/>
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke<br/>
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke<br/>
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)<br/>
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke<br/>
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke<br/>
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
