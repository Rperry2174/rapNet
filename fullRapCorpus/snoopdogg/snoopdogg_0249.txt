<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
Tonight, there's gonna be a whole lot of smoke in the air<br/>
Blow it hard for the ones who ain't here<br/>
Seems like every day we're putting one six feet underground<br/>
So blessed - what goes up, must come down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]</i><br/>
Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality<br/>
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it<br/>
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Miley Cyrus]</i><br/>
Ashtrays and heartbreaks<br/>
I lost some, let's toast to one<br/>
So put 'em high, let's reminisce<br/>
You're gone, but you never miss<br/>
Ashtrays and heartbreaks<br/>
I lost some, let's toast to one<br/>
So raise a glass to the memories<br/>
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays<br/>
Fill up all those ashtrays<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
Tomorrow when you wake up and realize life ain't fair<br/>
Throw it back, and make the whole world disappear<br/>
You never miss what you had until it's gone<br/>
When it's right, something always will go wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]</i><br/>
Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality<br/>
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it<br/>
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?<br/>

Ashtrays and heartbreaks<br/>
I lost some, let's toast to one<br/>
So raise a glass to the memories<br/>
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays<br/>
Fill up all those ashtrays<br/>
