<i>[Kokane (Battlecat)]</i><br/>
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah<br/>
I got to snoop, so cold<br/>
Big Snoop (Battlecat, Snoop Dogg)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kokane]</i><br/>
I hear the sercrets that you keep<br/>
When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
I hear the secrets that you keep<br/>
When you're talking in your sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane]</i><br/>
When you close your eyes and you go to sleep<br/>
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep<br/>
I'mma get you before you get me<br/>
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak<br/>
You're talking shit about me<br/>
Turn around and you're the homie<br/>
Man that shit is phoney<br/>
Tried to set me up bro<br/>
But you were singing to my hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
From a nigga to a dub<br/>
From a g to a scrub<br/>
I'm a vet on the set<br/>
I'mma show you what it was<br/>
Y'all flipping out, trippin' out<br/>
Cause I took a different route<br/>
6-2 rag, hell yeah come dippin' out<br/>
Beach city rider, 85'er, eastsider<br/>
Ain't none of y'all niggas live-er<br/>
I hear the bad shit that y'all talk<br/>
You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught<br/>
I'mma show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught<br/>
A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk<br/>
It's a cold game<br/>
It's like a rap riddle<br/>
Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle<br/>
Most neighborhoods started off cool<br/>
In the eighties it was Long Beach fool<br/>
With no seperation<br/>
Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation<br/>
You know my game is amazing<br/>
I keep blazing<br/>
Eastside niggas is the craziest and the shadiest<br/>
Yeah dawg, tell 'em again<br/>
What you talking 'bout loc?<br/>
I got hell of a ends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane (Battlecat)]</i><br/>
Hell boss<br/>
Hoping that her smiling exes fall (ego hustling loopholes)<br/>
I'd always thought that you would've never have stabbed me everywhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
More rumours, more lies<br/>
More money, more time<br/>
I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine<br/>
So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine<br/>
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes<br/>
So jealous, so envious<br/>
What a drag<br/>
Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man<br/>
Your message is how blessed you is<br/>
I guess you is<br/>
Look at the mess you in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane]</i><br/>
When you close your eyes and you go to sleep<br/>
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep<br/>
I'mma get you before you get me<br/>
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
