<i>[Chorus: Pharrell]</i><br/>
(Sets Up!) Chest out<br/>
In and out, in and out<br/>
Lift your arm, lift your arm<br/>
In a circle, in a circle<br/>
Swang out, hang out, bang out<br/>
Show these motherfuckers right where you from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Coolest of the cool, I'm the god damn man<br/>
Heater so hot need a god damn fan<br/>
Everybody want gangsta, suckas don't live it<br/>
til' they talkin' through that glass like 'see you in a minute'<br/>
That's not the Bigg Bo$$ Dogg<br/>
I've been in it since a youngin', I'm a Eastside hogg<br/>
21st Street ridin', Rollin' with my partners<br/>
Hat to the back in a rag spillin' vodka<br/>
Stompin' through the city in my big blue Chuck's<br/>
Lil' homies on the corner not givin' a fuck<br/>
So I chunked up the set like what's happenin' with you<br/>
Shit I just do what I do, I'm just stackin' it too<br/>
Is what he said to a loc as I dipped on out<br/>
Or as we say on the Eastside, you Cripped on out<br/>
See the sunshine and palm trees, livin' it up<br/>
Don't forget the block boys givin' it up<br/>
Where you from loc?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Pharrell]</i><br/>
(Sets Up!) Chest out<br/>
In and out, in and out<br/>
Lift your arm, lift your arm<br/>
In a circle, in a circle<br/>
Swang out, hang out, bang out<br/>
Show these motherfuckers right where you from<br/>
<br/>
Show me where you're from<br/>
Show me where you're from<br/>
Show me where you're from<br/>
Show me where you're from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
For the rules of the game, represent your shit<br/>
Flag around the steering collar makin 'em sick<br/>
Shoot, the L.B. made me, gangbang for real<br/>
If ya made it through the '80s I'm a product of the shady<br/>
Snoop D-O-doub', it's what I does<br/>
I'm worldwide love, the homies is like cuz<br/>
Stuck to the script and kept claimin' the team<br/>
They love it when I chunk it on the TV screen<br/>
Like a, Bo$$ would do, how the fuck could you<br/>
deny my gangsta, haters in my rearview<br/>
All around the world they respectin' a G<br/>
Overseas they respectin' the C, that's on me<br/>
I did it like I did it mayne<br/>
Uh, if you ain't did it you ain't did a thang<br/>
Uh, you come through you better holler at me<br/>
You need beats you better holler at P<br/>
Now put your sets up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Pharrell]</i><br/>
(Sets Up!) Chest out<br/>
In and out, in and out<br/>
Lift your arm, lift your arm<br/>
In a circle, in a circle<br/>
Swang out, hang out, bang out<br/>
Show these motherfuckers right where you from<br/>
<br/>
Show me where you're from<br/>
Show me where you're from<br/>
Show me where you're from<br/>
Show me where you're from
