Go! Swizzy! Snoop Dogg!<br/>
<br/>
I’m in the zone like, lockin’ alone like<br/>
Niggas keep talkin’ but I’m sittin' on the phone like<br/>
Picking a bone like, sittin’ on my throne like<br/>
Niggas is wrong like, singing’ my song like<br/>
My nigga I’m so tight, spitin' with gold mic<br/>
Walk through a dark cloud, came out in a strobe light<br/>
Rockin’ a robe like, Hef with his hoes like<br/>
Heavy is the head but to me its the soul like<br/>
Eat with the rich and get back to the low lifes<br/>
Cup with his Cool-Aid the flavor is so right<br/>
Dip in and floss like, ship it in one night<br/>
Fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Swizz Beatz &amp; Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em up<br/>
Lemme-lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em up<br/>
Snoop Dogg!<br/>
Aye, lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low<br/>
Lemme-lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em low<br/>
Snoop Dogg!<br/>
Aye, now that's what's up<br/>
<br/>
I’m back in my zone like<br/>
Living a long life, stuffin’ the bone like<br/>
Puffin’ a long night, pingin’ the pong like<br/>
Singin’ a song like, King of the Kong like<br/>
Godzilla fo'realla, my killas is so right<br/>
If it don’t go right, make sure you all ride<br/>
Deuce deuce and a Tec-9 with a .4-5<br/>
Niggas is so dead, my nigga I’m so live<br/>
Back in my zone like niggas hittin’ my phone like<br/>
Shoot him some bail like, cuz he won’t tell right?<br/>
The homies don’t act like, the homies don’t act right<br/>
Under interrogation becomes cooperation<br/>
That's why I dealt like, solo and bolo like<br/>
Kick a little ass and talk shit like I’m Dolomite<br/>
Dip in and floss like, ship it in one night<br/>
Fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life<br/>
<br/>
