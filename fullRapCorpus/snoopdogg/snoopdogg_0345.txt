Man I had a crazy crazy dream dogg.<br/>
I had a dream I was in the NBA straight playin basketball.<br/>
NBA straight getting my ball on dogg.<br/>
Can you imagine?  <br/>
Snoop Dogg in the NBA? <br/>
Imagine that, Hoop Doggy Dogg.<br/>
Yea straight ballin.<br/>
You know I'm a ball anyway so why not.<br/>
Let me get my ball on.<br/>
<br/>
If I could play in the NBA<br/>
I would be that six-four all day shootin that trey<br/>
I dribbled to the outside and passed it to Shaq<br/>
they double teamed on him so he passed it back<br/>
Look at the 3 but I don't take the shot<br/>
cause I think I'm cold and I aint trying to get hot<br/>
I'm feelin bionic, we playing the Sonics<br/>
And I'm sticking Gary Payton so you know I'm ball hatin<br/>
Bang on Vin Baker cause real Lakers really don't care yea yea<br/>
Next stop in the court on Damon toast Stouda and my homeboy J.R. Rider<br/>
Minnesota Timberwolves, we cut 'em down<br/>
Hakeem Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen, we shut 'em down<br/>
The Twin Towers, Dave and Duncan <br/>
20 in the paint fool you get's nothing<br/>
On a four game roll sweep, beep beep<br/>
We beat the Bulls and we rocked the Heat<br/>
And we traded for a few players, some Pacers<br/>
Miller and Mullin and now they Lakers<br/>
We cant be beat now, we on a 27 game win streak now, bow wow<br/>
When it all started from a dream<br/>
I'm playin point guard on my favorite team (Lakers)<br/>
I got the big perm, doing interviews with Chick Herm<br/>
At Stu Lance, we do a dance<br/>
When it rains poppin shampane<br/>
Basketball yes yall thats the game<br/>
Two years ago a friend of mine <br/>
Ask me to glide from the free throw line<br/>
So I took the ball, and as I made the hoop <br/>
Everybody jumped up and they said "Go Snoop"<br/>
And my career jumped off into the fast lane <br/>
My rookie season I made my first all star game<br/>
Double G like George Gervin, thats what the call me cause I'm so ice<br/>
Ballin cause that's my life, I balls all day, and I balls all night<br/>
They call me Snoop Dogg and everybody know I love to hustle and ball<br/>
The season gettin tragic we lost to the Magic<br/>
and the word is that Rodman done had it<br/>
So I guess it on a young homie, the great number 8, Mr. Koby<br/>
Give him the ball dogg he ready<br/>
We got to play Charlotte tonight, I'm stickin Eddie<br/>
Remember all the good times that we had<br/>
Cuz dont trip to long cause tommorow we play the Jazz<br/>
Then it on to play the Denver Nuggets<br/>
The homeboy Nick they traded, but damn I still love 'em<br/>
Keep a picture of 'em on the wall next to Dr. J<br/>
Meach, I love basketball<br/>
Allen Iverson on the fly boy he hard to stick<br/>
C Webb comin through with a quick pick<br/>
The NBA Saturday mornings hey or maybe on a Sunday<br/>
We in the playoffs so stay off the court<br/>
This aint no game, this a sport<br/>
And we in it to win it, we ballin, No Limit<br/>
Remember this <br/>
When I grow up on wanted to be a point guard playing on NBC<br/>
With Herb and Suge or Pistol Pete or World B. Free givin dap to me<br/>
Givin up my dues with converse shoes <br/>
And tellin all the kids to stay in school<br/>
This is true and your dreams can come true<br/>
if it happen to me, it can happen to you<br/>
<br/>
That's for all the NBA players that dream of being a rapper.<br/>
I'm a rapper that dreams of being a NBA player and I'm a baller.<br/>
Let's bounce up out of here man.
