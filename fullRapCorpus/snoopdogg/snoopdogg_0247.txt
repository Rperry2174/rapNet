Days like these are days I love<br/>
Runnin round going nowhere<br/>
Glad I get to steal all your time<br/>
Smilin cuz I know that I'm the one that makes you smile<br/>
Love the way you say my name<br/>
And how you laugh at all the stupid things I say<br/>
It's all lovin', no hate<br/>
Hangin with you while you're hangin', hangin' on my arm (And I like it)<br/>
Your hand on my back while we drivin', drivin' in my car (And I like it)<br/>
<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
This is what people look all their lives to find<br/>
And baby we found it<br/>
Right on time<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
And now that we got it<br/>
We gotta keep it going strong going strong<br/>
Gotta keep it going on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Anytime I'm feeling alone<br/>
There'll be a text from you on my phone<br/>
Just to say you're thinking of me<br/>
And when we are apart I know it's only me you see<br/>
Love the way you have my back<br/>
And how when I make no sense<br/>
You still understand<br/>
When nobody else can<br/>
Hangin' with you when you're hangin' hangin' on my arm (And I like it)<br/>
Your hand on my hand while we kissin' kissin' in the dark (And I like it)<br/>
<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
This is what people look all their lives to find<br/>
And baby we found it<br/>
Right on time<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
And now that we got it<br/>
We gotta keep it going strong going strong<br/>
Gotta keep it going on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
All this love<br/>
Is the best drug there could ever be<br/>
And I get high on you and me<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can see<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
This is what people look all their lives to find<br/>
And baby we found it<br/>
Right on time<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
And now that we got it<br/>
We gotta keep it going strong keep it strong<br/>
Keep it keep it goin' on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin' on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin' on (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
This is what people look all their lives to find<br/>
And baby we found it<br/>
Right on time<br/>
This is the good, good<br/>
And now that we got it<br/>
We gotta keep it going strong keep it strong<br/>
Keep it keep it goin' on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin' on (yeah)<br/>
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin' on (yeah)<br/>
This is the good, good
