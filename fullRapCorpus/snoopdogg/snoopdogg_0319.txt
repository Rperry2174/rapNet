<i>[Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
Let me blow the smoke all in the air<br/>
You know it's a party when Snoop's here<br/>
The ladies let their hair go down low<br/>
We let the whole club lights down low<br/>
Down low<br/>
In the BBM<br/>
She checkin' for my name in the BBM<br/>
I used to want a all black Beamer then<br/>
She don't really know how I seen her then<br/>
The west coast light, she ain't seen it yet<br/>
She ain't seen it yet<br/>
Fuck it, let's celebrate<br/>
Screw it, let's celebrate<br/>
Fuck it, let's celebrate<br/>
Snoop Dogg, we celebrate<br/>
Now let the beat drop<br/>
Now let the beat drop<br/>
Now let the beat drop<br/>
Now let the beat drop<br/>
Now let the beat drop<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
All about this paper while I'm rollin' up this paper, though<br/>
In case you didn't know, I'm blowin' on that high endo<br/>
Swizzy told me let it go, so I'm-a act a fool tonight<br/>
I'm in the building and I'm coolin' and I'm chillin' like<br/>
Never felt this way before, so I guess I'm-a let it go<br/>
Since I'm-a let it go, you better get ready for<br/>
More than the incredible, teach her what you gotta<br/>
Came for a little but I left with a whole lotta<br/>
Walked to the top but I started from the bottom<br/>
Celebrate tonight by raisin' up your fuckin' bottles<br/>
Smoke in the air, now everybody take a swallow<br/>
Snoop Dogg is that nigga you should follow<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Baby let her hair down when she heard that I was comin'<br/>
I can be your nigga, are you down to be my woman?<br/>
This is real pimpin', California, why you runnin'?<br/>
The other dudes fakin', baby, I keep it one hundred<br/>
Straight shooter with the Buddha, take a hit and get your mind right<br/>
Offered me some head, I told that little bitch that I might<br/>
In the mean time, let me bust and get my green right<br/>
We a hundred deep, goddamn I got my team right<br/>
We celebratin' lovin' this life<br/>
Your favorite rapper back up on the mizzic<br/>
From the underground to the roof, ya'll<br/>
It's your friendly neighborhood big Snoop Dogg<br/>
