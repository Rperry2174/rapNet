<i>[Kokane]</i><br/>
Life is much mo' precious<br/>
Than you'll think<br/>
Like a game'll make yo chips sink<br/>
It's so hard<br/>
Hard to trust a smile and face<br/>
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place<br/>
Keep my head up and stand tall<br/>
If I stumble, then I'll fall<br/>
Will you pick me up at all?<br/>
Will you pick me up at all?<br/>
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end<br/>
Cause some people do pretend<br/>
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends<br/>
That we can call friends<br/>
Ohhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up<br/>
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind<br/>
But I'm kind-hearted<br/>
And don't like being stepped on<br/>
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position<br/>
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say<br/>
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day<br/>
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody<br/>
But you know what I never do?<br/>
Smoke it off like Gotti<br/>
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones<br/>
Tray Deee &amp; Snoop, we sound good on this microphone<br/>
I never threaten nobody to make it happen<br/>
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'<br/>
But if I had a chance to give it back<br/>
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that<br/>
Do that, straight from the heart<br/>
Eastside till I die<br/>
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
It's a trip how we Crip<br/>
Suppose the enemies still<br/>
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears<br/>
Insane's and 20's both from the same city<br/>
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many<br/>
Me, C, and the G can think back to the start<br/>
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park<br/>
And having a heart<br/>
To get 'em up if it was beef<br/>
Head up like G's, take it out in the street<br/>
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view<br/>
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few<br/>
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case<br/>
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase<br/>
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke<br/>
A Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close<br/>
And y'all kids, my kids, so we family now<br/>
Cause I could never see you doing bad without<br/>
And that's real<br/>
<br/>

Life is much mo' precious<br/>
Than you'll think<br/>

It's so hard<br/>
Hard to trust a smile and face<br/>
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place<br/>
Keep my head up and stand tall<br/>
If I stumble, then I'll fall<br/>
Will you pick me up at all?<br/>
Will you pick me up at all?<br/>
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end<br/>
Cause some people do pretend<br/>
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends<br/>
That we can call friends...<br/>
