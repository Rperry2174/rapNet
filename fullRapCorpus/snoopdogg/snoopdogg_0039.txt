Chorus<br/>
<i>[Master P]</i><br/>
Watcha goin do when we come for you<br/>
<i>[Master P/Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
If you a dog you better not run  (Uhhhhh!)  <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
See I'm tired of being broke, I like to smoke<br/>
I love the west coast but I need a vacation bro<br/>
I took me a ride down south<br/>
I see the dog into bigger and better thing yall know what I'm talkin bout<br/>
The game is to be sold, not to be told<br/>
I'm a No Limit soldier and I'm off parole<br/>
Nigga, let's put the pieces to the puzzle<br/>
Now, every nigga that you hate would hate your cousin or your brother<br/>
Nigga, let's keep it real<br/>
Keep your eyes on your enemies cause some niggas kill<br/>
And the bitches, they'll break ya<br/>
Keep your dick in your pants nigga, cause they'll play ya<br/>
Keep your dogs in the house<br/>
Trill niggas from the street (woof woof) know what I'm talkin bout<br/>
Never bite the hand that feeds you<br/>
Cause you never know when your dog might need you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Went from halves to wholes, from wood to marble floors<br/>
Fuckin with hoodrats to top notch hoes<br/>
In my Rolls with the sunroof top<br/>
I told you hoes that Snoop Dogg won't stop<br/>
Tick tock, we got shit locked (say what)<br/>
Goddamn it feel good to be sittin on top<br/>
So let's toast to the gin and juice and champaigne<br/>
Welcome to my world and Snoop is the name<br/>
Nigga, and pass me the green sticky<br/>
We only fuckin with the real nigga, you aint gotta lie to kick it<br/>
Cause we aint picky if you lick it<br/>
Or stick it, girl is you down with this quicky<br/>
I gotta show to do in Europe and one in Japan<br/>
So when you see me on stage Snoop Dogg is the name<br/>
Nigga, yeah, that's real, huh<br/>
Whatch yall gonna do when we come for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
