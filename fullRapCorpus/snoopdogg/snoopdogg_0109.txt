<i>[Voice talking (echo)]</i><br/>
Yeah .. niggas wanna take care of these hoes<br/>
Niggas wanna control these hoes<br/>
You can't control these bitches<br/>
These is independent bitches these years<br/>
You can't understand the 2000 in here?<br/>
Motherfuckers wanna put they mack down<br/>
Wanna put they soder down<br/>
Let a bitch do what she wanna do<br/>
If she chose to ride wit a G<br/>
Then let her ride wit a G<br/>
The bitch don't wanna sit back and be a housewife all the time<br/>
Let the ho be what she wanna be<br/>
A real slut, and let the ho get on and make her money<br/>
You understand? I got a homey sittin' by me<br/>
Understand this nigga don't understand because he's a young nigga<br/>
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm been in the game since '85<br/>
And I know a ho don't do nothin', wanna play a nigga like 9 to 5, alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
YIKES, Shabba dabble do <i>[light barking noise]</i> I can dig it baby, you know<br/>
Because these hoes, they can't be controlled<br/>
You gotta find 'em, spot 'em, send 'em, get em, got 'em, you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Male voice (Snoop Dogg)]</i><br/>
It wasn't (uh uh) your fault (it wasn't your fault)<br/>
You was only tryin' to be nice (tryin' be nice)<br/>
Only tryin to be nice, ohh (can't be nice to these hoes)<br/>
You know you can't control these hoes (no, no, no)<br/>
You know you can't control these hoes (can't control these hoes)<br/>
You know you can't control these hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
What she do, she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two<br/>
That's on you, you shoulda put your foot in her ass, like a pimp's supposed to do<br/>
But instead of goin' 'upside da head'<br/>
You bought her a 5 karat wit your bread<br/>
And then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head<br/>
I ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin', what you do<br/>
When your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do<br/>
What we do, we check 'em from the gate, to keep a bitch straight<br/>
It's on you, see you can take her out and buy her all types of things<br/>
You's a fool, cause when she leave you, for what he do<br/>
You'll see fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Me and you, that's what you thought 'til your ass got caught<br/>
Shame on you, and now I understand why my momma used to tell me that<br/>
Ain't that true, you can't make a queen out a motherfuckin' hoodrat<br/>
Game on you, cause now you back at your momma house<br/>
And you sleepin' on tha copeasack<br/>
What's she do, I gave her the keys to my '74 Cadillac<br/>
Say it ain't true, she let a nigga drive it, ask tha homie Battlecat<br/>
Whatchu do, put my foot in her ass and mashed tha gas<br/>
You know me, and ever since that day my nigga, I've been P I M P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Thats your boo, but she know every nigga in the Roc-A-Fella Crew<br/>
That's on you, baby blow too much, I mean she know too much<br/>
That's my boo, it's all about who she did and where she been<br/>
I love you, you shouldn't a told her that, you should a smacked her flat<br/>
Shame on you (shame on you), your so in love you fittin' to get a tattoo<br/>
That ain't cool (that ain't cool), love is blind and no friend of mine<br/>
If I was you, I'd a packed her bags and bust anotha bitch thats bad<br/>
Game got rules, if you lose a ho, you gotta gain a ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
