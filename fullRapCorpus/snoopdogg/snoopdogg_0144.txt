(Get it right Dogg!)<br/>
I need a light, let me lean, make it bright, everythang is dynamite<br/>
(Ahhhh true!)<br/>
Bust a bitch, tryna feel like a pimp would<br/>
It's Snoop D O Double G, I'm in ya neighborhood<br/>
I make it crack-a-lack, do it just like that<br/>
Take a sip of this, nigga have a puff of that<br/>
You had enough of that? Yeah, give it right back<br/>
Now lay ya head back and roll in the Cadillac<br/>
How we do what we do, what it is, where it's goin down.. and the<br/>
motherfuckers flip it<br/>
Rip it, get specific, and dip it and then they drip it<br/>
'Cause you know we like to pop it 'cause you talkin so different<br/>
Fix your Focus and ride.. I want the bangers to bang<br/>
Or get hyphy with my niggaz up north by the Bay<br/>
Tryna twist in my whip, I got the big body Benz<br/>
'Cause I'm rollin with my nephew and we smokin again<br/>
"Turn your music down low, man yo' shit too loud!"<br/>
What the fuck you talkin 'bout, I put my gun in yo' mouth nigga! (in yo' mouth!)<br/>

<i>[Hook: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>

Let me get a light, nigga let me get a light! (Get it right Dogg!)<br/>
Yeah, better get it right<br/>
Nigga let me get a light, homey let me get a light!<br/>

<i>[Chorus: Damian Marley]</i><br/>
To get it tight they gotta get a light<br/>
Well, to get it tight they gotta get a liggghhht! (Get it right Dogg!)<br/>
To get it tight they gotta get a light<br/>
No, to get it tight they gotta get a liggghhht!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Hip-Hop! I ball like a split end, I'm all like I been in<br/>
I'm tryna put my bid in<br/>
Rip ride and try to keep it all hid in<br/>
Slide to the left and let yo' G homey get in<br/>
Gloccs of Velveeta, yep I'm off the meter<br/>
Ride by and see ya with my hands on a heater<br/>
Wanna be like the O but you act like a hoe<br/>
Gotta lot of Patron, with a shot of the malt<br/>
Wanna be's wanna beef like nine-ninety nine<br/>
You wanna battle me? You better learn how to rhyme<br/>
Boys stop tweakin 'fore I light up the place<br/>
What he say? Who you talkin 'bout? I'm right in ya face<br/>
Aye! Aye! Baby girl you know we hit the coot a lot<br/>
Me and my nephews, yeah, we stayin true to life<br/>
They get the party live, Dogg is the motivator<br/>
Rockin the block socket and knockin down the player haters<br/>
Yeah nigga.. you better know, it's incredible, unforgettable<br/>
Yeah, I bet I'm slow and I bet I'm low<br/>
We at the L.A. zoo, I'm whylin out like an ambulance!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook + Chorus]</i><br/>
