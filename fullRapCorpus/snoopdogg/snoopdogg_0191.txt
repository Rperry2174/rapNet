<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Uugh, yeah<br/>
Snoop, Kells, once again<br/>
And this is for the non-believers<br/>
That seem to think that pimping is easy<br/>
Aiyyo Uncle Snoop<br/>
Let's go get these knuckleheads<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Pop bottles (pop bottles)<br/>
Shake hands (shake hands)<br/>
Recognise (recognise) I'm the man<br/>
I try to tell 'em but they won't understand that pimping ain't easy<br/>
I got money (got money)<br/>
I got cars (got cars)<br/>
Still fucking with them hood superstars (superstars)<br/>
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar like pimping ain't easy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Well it ain't<br/>
All them faces in that laker paint<br/>
Casa by the lake<br/>
Make a little nigga faint<br/>
Balling is what I does<br/>
I ain't messing with you can'ts<br/>
I'm a can do negro<br/>
A real life California hero<br/>
About six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account<br/>
Nigga ain't ya mad at me<br/>
I'm so happy to see that you stopped your life to watch mine<br/>
Yeah you see it fool<br/>
Snoop's everywhere, Italy I'm heavy there<br/>
Did a show in Rome like hoe say you ain't never there<br/>
Talking 'bout you popping bottles<br/>
I don't see none<br/>
You made it rain where?<br/>
I don't see a wand<br/>
Go on get it off<br/>
That's what they like to hear<br/>
It's your money pimp<br/>
We don't fight it here<br/>
It's hard enough to be me<br/>
Not trying to be you is someting I got to see<br/>
Until then I'mma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
This ain't a joke a loc made it look easy to you<br/>
I been through some shit<br/>
I made it easy for ya<br/>
Now you ain't got to do much, I pop at everybody<br/>
Go unwrap a bottle, share it with them busybodies<br/>
Tell 'em what she want to hear<br/>
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here<br/>
And Snoopy is your homie<br/>
Nah nah girl he out of here<br/>
Yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here<br/>
You a fool Jack<br/>
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch<br/>
Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch<br/>
Go ahead and talk money<br/>
Talk, look at the chicks it brought<br/>
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault<br/>
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for<br/>
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for<br/>
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool<br/>
I pop cause I'm the man<br/>
Now watch me and Kells<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
I got pimping in my veins<br/>
Pimping in my blood<br/>
Pimping in my swag<br/>
Pimping in my cup<br/>
Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club<br/>
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love<br/>
Pimp by day, pimp by night<br/>
Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight<br/>
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug<br/>
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck<br/>
But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up<br/>
And keep it sexy pimping cause thats how I does<br/>
Uncle Snoop say Kells go hard or go home<br/>
Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
To all my honeys in the club getting money with the thugs<br/>
Keep it pimping baby<br/>
Keep it pimping baby<br/>
Southside, westside, eastside, northside<br/>
Keep it pimping baby<br/>
Keep it pimping
