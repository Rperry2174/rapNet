<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<i>[Thurgood of PJ's]</i><br/>
Yeah, get up, get down<br/>
That's what P Funk say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Get your money man, it's hard out there<br/>
It's hard out there, dogg<br/>
What, yeah, huh<br/>
Get yours, get yours, get yours<br/>
<br/>
Shootin' dice on length with a couple of G's<br/>
Dust off my knees, twist off my cap and breathe<br/>
Jump in the six-four, sittin' on D<br/>
Spit a few caps at my enemies<br/>
Please, freeze, there's a new sheriff in town<br/>
Livin' in the projects, Dogg Pound Pound<br/>
No father figure, just gangbang nigga<br/>
Cuz they give it up quicker and they learn to pull a trigger<br/>
All role models on TV<br/>
Most of us ain't got a TV, you feel me?<br/>
Shit, Michael Jordan don't come through<br/>
I bet the nigga get the money when it time to sell his shoe<br/>
I'm telling you, I ain't puttin' him down<br/>
Cuz I love him to death but I ain't ever seen him in my town<br/>
But you could see Snoop Dogg everyday<br/>
I'm boss to the blocks like the projects in the PJ's<br/>
Yeah, for those of you who don't know<br/>
This is the land of the scandalous and cut throats<br/>
Child support- that's unheard of<br/>
Number one crime in the motherfucker- murder<br/>
Ya heard me?  Hmm, I'ma stay down<br/>
For the get down, from a puppy to the big dogg<br/>
Put that on the penthouse<br/>
Life in the projects, bang, bang, pow, pow<br/>
Is how it sounds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Life in the projects<br/>
Where it's hard to get by<br/>
But you got it cuz your spot's gettin' hotter<br/>
Life in the projects<br/>
Where grass is cheese and cheese is power<br/>
Life in the projects<br/>
Where you got to have the will to know how<br/>
Know how to do what?  Survive<br/>
Life in the projects<br/>
You got to get yours cuz I'ma get mine<br/>
<br/>
Life in the projects, goodness grief<br/>
Everybody waitin' on the 1st and 15th<br/>
The police man is tryin' to get atcha<br/>
Catcha, snatcha, open up your fridge<br/>
Nuttin' lookin' back atcha<br/>
So you open up your freeza and say 'God, please'<br/>
I wish we had some more of this government cheese<br/>
I'm duckin' buckshots, see, walkin' on my knees<br/>
Ain't no trees, the grass ain't green<br/>
And when I say it's all bad, you know what I mean<br/>
There's One In Every Family- what?  A Fiend<br/>
And a basketball star with no team, no dreams<br/>
Remember good times?  JJ and Michael?<br/>
And all the lil' thangs they went through despite<br/>
Nobody in the projects gave a fuck<br/>
Ain't no good, it's all badluck, shucks, shoppin' poppin'<br/>
Back up on all the scene, from the George Down, PJ's, Cali or projects<br/>
And the Cabrini Greens, my niggas get wild on they ass<br/>
We like to pow-pow on they ass<br/>
Here's a toast to the coast, so take a blast<br/>
From the projects to the upper deck, upper class<br/>
A long way from where I come from<br/>
I know where I'm at, nigga, I can't forget where I came from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat to fade]</i><br/>
Life in the projects<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Adlibs]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I know all them real niggas out there that's livin' they life in the projects<br/>
That's going through that bullshit, y'know<br/>
I know how y'all niggas feel<br/>
Nigga, Doggy Dogg for ya pain<br/>
It's like I'm livin' in the motherfuckin' projects, too<br/>
Y'know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
They want y'all to throw me out my state<br/>
So, fuck<br/>
I might as well move back in the projects<br/>
That's where my real niggas at any motherfuckin' way<br/>
I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine<br/>
Life in the projects<br/>
Nigga, better get yours cuz I'ma get mine<br/>
Life in the projects, feel me?<br/>
You better get yours cuz I'ma get mine<br/>
Life in the projects, yeah<br/>
You better get yours cuz I'ma get mine<br/>
Life in the projects, yeah<br/>
We out, we out
