<i>[Chorus - X2]</i><br/>
It ain't safe to leave the house<br/>
Fuck around 'round here<br/>
These niggaz quick to air ya out<br/>
and lay ya down 'round here<br/>
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya<br/>
in the ground 'round here<br/>
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
M.L. and 21st, where niggaz worse<br/>
Quick to put one in ya first<br/>
Before they search your pockets get that china<br/>
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya<br/>
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit<br/>
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick<br/>
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya<br/>
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya<br/>
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach<br/>
Better watch them niggaz out here if they come from the East<br/>
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggaz can see<br/>
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me<br/>
My city's a beast..<br/>
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece<br/>
You can't talk to police 'cause most police is like me<br/>
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street<br/>
They want that paper out here<br/>
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here<br/>
Enough to have somebody take your place out here<br/>
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - X2]</i><br/>
It ain't safe to leave the house<br/>
Fuck around 'round here<br/>
These niggaz quick to air ya out<br/>
and lay ya down 'round here<br/>
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya<br/>
in the ground 'round here<br/>
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
This L.A. County nigga<br/>
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga<br/>
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain<br/>
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed<br/>
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam<br/>
And just like Sam niggaz just don't give a damn<br/>
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain<br/>
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing<br/>
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West<br/>
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest<br/>
These niggaz come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit<br/>
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch<br/>
This shit is a mess..<br/>
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest<br/>
You can't talk to police 'cause most police ain't gon' stress<br/>
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest<br/>
They want that paper out here<br/>
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here<br/>
Enough to have somebody take your place out here<br/>
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - X2]</i><br/>
It ain't safe to leave the house<br/>
Fuck around 'round here<br/>
These niggaz quick to air ya out<br/>
and lay ya down 'round here<br/>
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya<br/>
in the ground 'round here<br/>
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here
