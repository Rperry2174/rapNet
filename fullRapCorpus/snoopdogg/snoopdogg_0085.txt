<i>[Alien]</i><br/>
I am Sir Dogg, DPG fuck... and I hate water.<br/>
I never learned to swim....<br/>
AAAAH! PUT ME DOWN!!!! Let go of my leg!!!<br/>
I HATE WATER!!!! I CAN'T SWIM!!!! AAAAH!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Now matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me,<br/>
And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me,<br/>
Show us how you do it Uncle Snoopy,<br/>
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggaz gon' respect me,<br/>
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though,<br/>
Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo,<br/>
And niggaz wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?<br/>
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?<br/>
I make dat shit for the realest of millions,<br/>
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin',<br/>
Hmm... and oh what a relief it is,<br/>
That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz,<br/>
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit,<br/>
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz<br/>
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes,<br/>
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow,<br/>
Fuck these niggaz and peep out Whitey Ro (?),<br/>
Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on,<br/>
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on,<br/>
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on,<br/>
She either fuckin' gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home,<br/>
Well number one, keep your hand on your gun,<br/>
And don't (don't) trust (trust) anyone (anyone, one, one.....)<br/>
<br/>
Ohh... you can't trust nobody baby.... you can't even trust your own Mama!!!<br/>
This is Snoopy Collins.... trust no one.... especially a bitch....<br/>
Or even a bitch-ass nigga.... Yo Ha!!!!<br/>
<br/>
T-R-U-S-T in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy,<br/>
The homies in the hood call me Lil' Bo Peep,<br/>
And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet,<br/>
So Snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?<br/>
Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you,<br/>
Now what I'm tryin' to do, and what I'm gon' do,<br/>
Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home,<br/>
Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for cuz, or down wit' bud<br/>
Pushin' them dubs, look here cuz,<br/>
Lemme tell you how it's gon' be<br/>
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me<br/>
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?<br/>
Ask them hoes over there, "Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?" (yeah!)<br/>
We'll take the money and the game away,<br/>
I bet they won't say the same that day,<br/>
But it's okay, cuz I don't trip,<br/>
Cuz "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks",<br/>
I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja,<br/>
East side, long beach, gang-bang roller,<br/>
From the solar, cuz this, is it,<br/>
Can ya dig it? (I can dig it!!!)<br/>
Jelly Roll pulled a rabbit out his hat,<br/>
I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back (Aaah!), cuz I know it's like dat,<br/>
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread,<br/>
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead,<br/>
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds,<br/>
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the Reds,<br/>
But I'm a Dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true,<br/>
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone,<br/>
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin',<br/>
Rip-ridin', put mines in,<br/>
Takin' this game to the next level,<br/>
Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils,<br/>
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up,<br/>
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up,<br/>
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one),<br/>
And like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alien]</i><br/>
OH NO!!! YOU DID IT AGAIN!!!! PUT ME DOWN!!!!<br/>
I HATE WATER, I CAN'T SWIM!!!! I NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM!!!!<br/>
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED YOU!!!! I PUT ALL OF MY TRUST IN YOU!!!!<br/>
AND YOU TOOK ME TO THE WATER..... OH NO!!!!
