Oooh Oooooh.<br/>
Close the door<br/>
I'mma goin in<br/>
And that for sure<br/>
Gonna lay ya out out out<br/>
And I know you luv a nigga breakin it down<br/>
Everytime I'm with her, I get her hooo, I get her hoo, luv drunk<br/>
Everytime she's with, she in me, luv drunk<br/>
<br/>
You know who I am I'm the mothafockin dogg<br/>
The sheets fucked up and you know it was me<br/>
You hit a bedspreak all way down the street<br/>
It sounds like a song we fuckin' to the beat<br/>
I put ma rat-tat-tat in her boom boom pow<br/>
Then she put her tit-tit-tit all up in my mouth<br/>
I told you before I don't luv them ho's<br/>
But she got that good good can't let 'r go<br/>
And I gotta let 'r know<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I'm with her, I get her hooo, I get her hoo, luv drunk<br/>
Everytime she's with, she in me, luv drunk<br/>
She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' for..<br/>
And I got that fire luvin', the more you need the more<br/>
Oooh lemme say oooohooh aaahaaaah<br/>
Everytime she's with me, me I'm dizzy<br/>
<br/>
Shoot to the spot cause the spot is the lick<br/>
Pull your lunchbreak lemme hit it real quick<br/>
Back to your job before they know what is<br/>
Luvin so good, we already made three kids<br/>
I dont know what it is but I luv what I did<br/>
Huggin and touchin' and all that shit<br/>
Drink to your drunk, see my luv is a fill<br/>
Yea this for you boo it's a gift<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I'm with her, I get her hooo, I get her hoo, luv drunk<br/>
Everytime she's with, she in me, luv drunk<br/>
She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' for..<br/>
And I got that fire luvin', the more you need the more<br/>
Oooh lemme say oooohooh aaahaaaah<br/>
Everytime she's with me, me I'm dizzy
