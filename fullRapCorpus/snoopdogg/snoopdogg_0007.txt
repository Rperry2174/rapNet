Six million ways to die, choose one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Kurupt, Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck i'm headed<br/>
Up or down, right or left, life or death<br/>
I see myself in a mist of smoke<br/>
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke<br/>
We hit a five dollar stick, now we puttin in work<br/>
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggaz<br/>
anybody killa, you know what the deal is<br/>
Nigga, you know what the real is<br/>
<br/>
I see some mark brand niggaz on the corner flaggin me down<br/>
Sayin, "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?<br/>
Is that nigga snoop alright? Aiyyo what's up with the crew?<br/>
Is them niggaz in jail, or are them niggaz through?"<br/>
i said, if you ain't up on thangs<br/>
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game<br/>
It's like this they don't understand<br/>
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang<br/>
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggaz know<br/>
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row<br/>
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach<br/>
and Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's<br/>
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't<br/>
see long to the G of the gang<br/>
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest<br/>
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest<br/>
Now you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin<br/>
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i> Suicide, it's a suicide <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:  Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue<br/>
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew<br/>
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do<br/>
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh<br/>
Don't make a move for your gat so soon cuz<br/>
I drops bombs like Platoon (ay nigga)<br/>
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you<br/>
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you<br/>
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension<br/>
And when you do, that's when the mission<br/>
or survival, becomes your every thought<br/>
Keep your eyes open, cuz you don't wanna be caught<br/>
Half steppin with your weapon on safety<br/>
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me<br/>
take this 211 to another level<br/>
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil<br/>
Now roam through the depths of hell<br/>
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i> Suicide, it's a suicide <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name<br/>
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa<br/>
<br/>
(Wake up in the morning, to Lucky Charms cereal)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: RBX]</i><br/>
<br/>
Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this! <br/>
Let's picnic inside a morgue<br/>
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets<br/>
And I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates<br/>
open and release them guts<br/>
Then I release def cuts<br/>
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck<br/>
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X<br/>
Nuff respect given<br/>
Disrespect and you will not be livin<br/>
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i> Suicide, it's a suicide <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name<br/>
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa<br/>
<br/>
(Wake up in the morning, to Lucky Charms cereal)
