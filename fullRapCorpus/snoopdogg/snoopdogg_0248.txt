<i>[Verse 1: Rita Ora]</i><br/>
I heard him speak but then a saw his face<br/>
I knew we was the one because I dreamt this day<br/>
I was such a beginner on this thing called love<br/>
And now he's going away and now I'm torn apart, so torn apart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You're one of them, you see me swear<br/>
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day<br/>
Say goodbye to the one that got away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
Her lips for the very first thing that I saw<br/>
She threw like an angel and that made want some more<br/>
My reputation says I'm there from now<br/>
And now she's going away and now I'm so torn apart, so torn apart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You're one of them, you see me swear<br/>
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day<br/>
Say goodbye to the one that got away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Snoop Lion]</i><br/>
Never let you give up<br/>
But I should've let you got away<br/>
Got away, got to find another way<br/>
Never let 'em get away<br/>
Gotta find a way to stay<br/>
Never let 'em get away<br/>
Never let 'em get away<br/>
<br/>
You never let her go<br/>
You never let her go<br/>
<br/>
You see me?<br/>
You hear me?<br/>
Ye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You're one of them, you see me swear<br/>
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day<br/>
Say goodbye to the one that got away
