Guten tag, Ich liebe <i>[?]</i><br/>
Ich keine <i>[?]</i><br/>
Oh mein God<br/>
Ich glaube kommen<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Ich swear to God<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
You know my story<br/>
I did a lot of balling<br/>
Been around the world<br/>
A lot of girls calling<br/>
A lot of panties falling<br/>
Out the air and on the stage<br/>
If my life was a book<br/>
You wouldn't miss a page<br/>
But none of that really matters<br/>
When I <i>[?]</i><br/>
Seen her pass by<br/>
I damn near dropped my folds<br/>
I'm like Snoopy breathe<br/>
Kush had me gone<br/>
I couldn't think straight<br/>
Pimpin' was all alone<br/>
Shoulda seen her walking<br/>
Like a model do<br/>
If this was Twitter<br/>
I would follow you<br/>
Open your world to new things<br/>
Let Doggy take your hand<br/>
I'm seeing wedding rings<br/>
Call Diddy lets make a band<br/>
She got me hot<br/>
I don't want to leave<br/>
I seen the world's best<br/>
But she's something to see<br/>
And now I'm on a plane<br/>
Feeling so ashamed<br/>
I couldn't catch her name<br/>
I call her Miss Everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tell me have you seen her (Seen her)<br/>
Five something, pretty face, and them big brown eyes<br/>
Small little waist<br/>
When the floor goes tremble<br/>
Make a grown man cry<br/>
Oooh<br/>
I keep <i>[?]</i><br/>
But the numbers never got exchanged<br/>
Every town, every city<br/>
Got a, a Miss Everything<br/>
Miss Everything (Miss everything)<br/>
<br/>
You know my story<br/>
I rocked a lot of crowds<br/>
Sold millions of records<br/>
I love my fans so loud<br/>
I got a thousand cars<br/>
And all hopes of bein'<br/>
A real superstar<br/>
I live super far<br/>
But none of that really matters<br/>
When I caught my eyes in Spain<br/>
She walked into me<br/>
Like you did your thing<br/>
In that Spanish accent<br/>
The one I love so much<br/>
She looked like an angel<br/>
One I wanted to touch<br/>
I blinked my eye for a second<br/>
And then she disappeared<br/>
When I see that Pretty Woman<br/>
I felt like Richard Gere<br/>
Boss dog ain't never been one to watch it pass<br/>
Unless we in they room, and they leave<br/>
And I watch that ass<br/>
But baby something else<br/>
Somehow I didn't speak<br/>
I been a player so long<br/>
Maybe I reached my peak<br/>
And now I'm on a plane<br/>
Feeling so ashamed<br/>
I didn't catch her name<br/>
So I call her Miss Everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yah, you know my story<br/>
I seen a lot of hoes<br/>
A lot of gold diggers<br/>
Luda call them pros<br/>
I don't call them back<br/>
And thats just how it goes<br/>
Most people call me Snoopy<br/>
Or S-N-double-O<br/>
But none of that really matters<br/>
When I was in New York<br/>
I had a show at The Garden<br/>
You know, poppin' corks<br/>
That's when I seen her<br/>
From a distance<br/>
She smiled and froze<br/>
Now everything I learned in the game<br/>
Told me she chose<br/>
And I don't miss a beat<br/>
This time I gotta speak<br/>
She looked magnificent<br/>
Like something to eat<br/>
Hey co, I can't let her go<br/>
I made my way through the crowd<br/>
Let's get out of here<br/>
Head to Filipe Childs<br/>
Lotta stars in place<br/>
Doggy set the mood<br/>
I'm like "I like your style"<br/>
She's like "I like yours too"<br/>
Before I <i>[?]</i><br/>
I gotta know your name<br/>
She smiled as if she came<br/>
Call me Miss Everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
