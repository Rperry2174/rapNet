<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
‘Cause I’mma do my thang<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
(Do your natural thang)<br/>
Can I do my thang?<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Stay on the low, we get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
I bust a new batch, get it back just like that<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
I’m hard in the bank, never say what a nigga can’t<br/>
Do my thang, do my thang<br/>
Yea I’mma do my thang<br/>
I’mma do my thang<br/>
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Keep it on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Get a biatch, got a biatch<br/>
This shit, yea I got a lot of it<br/>
Money up, nah money back<br/>
I don’t tolerate none of that<br/>
Fill half a C and enjoy<br/>
And roll wit your motherfuckin homeboys<br/>
Dam-Funk drive the car<br/>
I’m smoking that blaze up like by afar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Do my thang<br/>
Yea I’mma do my thang<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Keep it on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
1-2, 1-2<br/>
Me and Dam came to funk you<br/>
I know you love everything that we does<br/>
This shit bang in the club<br/>
And ain’t no need to procrastinate<br/>
We on the 40 ounce, my nigga pass the A<br/>
And let me get yo back to the floor<br/>
Life when I was a young G back in ‘84<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Do my thang<br/>
Yea I’mma do my thang<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Keep it on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
<br/>
Greeting nebulons<br/>
It is I, Seth Me<br/>
You are now ordered to do your thing<br/>
Oh no<br/>
Your thing is your friend<br/>
Only you can do you<br/>
So do it do it do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Do my thang<br/>
Yea I’mma do my thang<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
I but a new batch, get it back just like that<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
I’m hard in the bank, never say what a nigga can’t<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Do my thang<br/>
Yea I’mma do my thang<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
Stay on the low and get it anywhere that we go<br/>
Let me do my thang<br/>
New gators on my feet, rollin up and down the streets<br/>
Let me do my thang
