<i>[scratching* "To the Batmobile - let's go!"]</i><br/>
"Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed"<br/>
"Roger, ready to move out"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[during Chorus - theme song of repeats the "Batman!" music + vocals]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lady of Rage &amp; RBX]</i><br/>
No one, can save the day like Batman<br/>
Robin, will make you sway like that and<br/>
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme<br/>
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime<br/>
No one, can save the day like Batman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Commissioner X here!<br/>
Batman &amp; Robin, we have a bit of a problem<br/>
There's trouble brewing in Gotham City<br/>
You MUST act fast!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady of Rage + (Snoop)]</i><br/>
Holy mackeral Batman!  I think these clowns need to back down<br/>
Let's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em and make 'em SCAT man<br/>
(When you say scat man, like the brother called brother) Uh-huh<br/>
(When it's on, it's cold, so bring the coroner cover)<br/>
We can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger<br/>
Go get The Riddler, to watch me play that nigga like a fiddler<br/>
on a hot tin roof, I got them watchin who?<br/>
She who spits it like she was sippin rot-ten brew, ooh<br/>
(We Marvel at you Comics, you ain't no Superhero)<br/>
You just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg + (Rage)]</i><br/>
Surprise!  The Dynamic Duo<br/>
Batman &amp; Robin, gats set for squabbin (nigga!)<br/>
Splat!  Hit 'em like forty-five shells (nigga!)<br/>
Plat!  Means more than one million sales<br/>
That's nuff shot to lick, you get done up<br/>
Plus we got the Bat gats, so why would you run up?<br/>
<br/>
"Batman!  Batman!  Batman."<br/>
<i>[scratched: "And you're about to find out"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[scratched: "And you're about to find out"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady of Rage]</i><br/>
Yeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and<br/>
Hit 'em with the POW! BAM! BIFF!  Whoa<br/>
Pick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace<br/>
When I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face<br/>
Robin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest<br/>
They wanna go head up and collide<br/>
And like collision, hope your moms made provisions<br/>
See you ain't got no wins baby, not even a smidgen<br/>
Mad hostility dealt, now I'ma really be felt<br/>
Switch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt<br/>
I go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter<br/>
Get, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder<br/>
So the, sayin goes, if you snooze you lose<br/>
Trust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Cold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin<br/>
Catnip for Catwoman so she caught the feeling<br/>
Huh, talk about flavor for a Pringle<br/>
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle<br/>
Damn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin<br/>
They hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Batman!  War is on the brink<br/>
It seems that the Penguin is causing a stink<br/>
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do<br/>
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Shit I'm there in a flash, Batmobile on 3's<br/>
Trust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze<br/>
And Clayface will catch the em-brace<br/>
of napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb<br/>
.. and don't you forget it<br/>
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
No one, can save the day like Batman<br/>
Robin, will make you sway like that and<br/>
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme<br/>
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime<br/>
No one, can save the day like Batman<br/>
Robin, will make you sway like that and<br/>
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme<br/>
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady of Rage]</i><br/>
Dirty Dinkins Batman!<br/>
Did you see those crispy khaki creases on that rugged wretched..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Aiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin<br/>
Get Alfred and tell him to have barbecued buffalo wings<br/>
and a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill<br/>
It's about to get real in the field<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady of Rage]</i><br/>
Leapin Lo-lo's!  Over there Batman!  That's a no-no!<br/>
Let's hop out this fo'-do'!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yea yea yea, systems engaged<br/>
Start the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches<br/>
You ready Robin?  Let's dip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady of Rage]</i><br/>
Let's, dip!  Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin crack in the alley<br/>
Let's, dip!  I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman!<br/>
We must, we MUST Batman, listen to me<br/>
Holy Leapin Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that come with it<br/>
And potatoes on top with gravy in the middle<br/>
God damnit Batman! <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da--da-da-dah - BATMAN!!"
