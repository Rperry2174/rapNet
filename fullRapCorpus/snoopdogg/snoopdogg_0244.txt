<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Fruit juice<br/>
Number one you know me caboose<br/>
In my God then with the fruit that they chose<br/>
Fruit juice in my glass you know me cannon loose<br/>
Take away my worry my stress and my blues<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
High level natural vibes what we give in<br/>
My princess say she love it when we write pandy rhythm<br/>
Natural berry also very good for the system<br/>
Some touch, some sweet, you just can't resist them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sweet sap, knees berry, cantaloupe, soup sop<br/>
Pineapple, mango my taste buds tangle<br/>
An ice cold beverage in my hunny come hideout<br/>
Chillin with my beautiful empress we are stand out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
High level natural vibes what we give in<br/>

Some touch, some sweet, you just can't resist them<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
She sip the beef juice, she really love the medicine<br/>
Twink it down slow feel it good vibe settling<br/>
The weaker flavours going down<br/>
She ordered up another round<br/>
Tell me that she feel alright<br/>
Walk to Jesus never spy<br/>
Feel me grab the juice<br/>
She ever held the upper tide<br/>
No drink the red bull,<br/>
Because she don't believe the hype<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
