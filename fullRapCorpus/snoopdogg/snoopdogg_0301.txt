<i>[Hook - Snoop Dogg x2:]</i><br/>
Baby, I come running<br/>
Baby, I come running<br/>
Just keep me coming<br/>
And I come running<br/>
Cause I'm your dog<br/>
Baby I'm your dog<br/>
So whenever you call<br/>
I come running<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
You ain't listenin'<br/>
So you can talk to me, don't listen to him<br/>
A body like that ain't hard to feed, cause girl I'll eat you up<br/>
All in a couple of seconds, girl I'll eat you up<br/>
It's when you realize you're in Heaven like how'd you get there?<br/>
Baby what you doin' in this chair? Couldn't let you sit there<br/>
You need help, somebody should get there<br/>
You see girl, time is like money, both of which men loathe<br/>
Spend them both with me and then for sure you'll know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
She's impressed by a fat boy<br/>
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy<br/>
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy<br/>
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it<br/>
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it<br/>
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard<br/>
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it<br/>
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force<br/>
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs<br/>
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job<br/>
Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight<br/>
I was several million up before it came to light<br/>
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it<br/>
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music<br/>
Smoked out like a player and you know the name<br/>
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I got... Rottweiler in tube sock<br/>
Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die<br/>
Boxer... you take mine's off then hallelujah<br/>
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times<br/>
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s<br/>
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we<br/>
Should tone it... down with the clean version<br/>
Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin<br/>
I like it... make me realize my vices<br/>
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates<br/>
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom<br/>
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room<br/>
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'ma cum in first place<br/>
I'ma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place<br/>
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree<br/>
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho<br/>
<br/>
