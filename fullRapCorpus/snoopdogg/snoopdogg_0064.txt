<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Yo nephew, give me some of that No Limit shit<br/>

Goldie Loc, hm-hmm<br/>
My nephew Silkk the Shocker<br/>
Oh yeah, we got somethin for the ladies too<br/>
Mia X, run this bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mia X]</i><br/>
Lyrical arsonist, lady alligator<br/>
Down South, hustler, former weight smuggler<br/>
I'm Mother, of the Tank, gave birth to an army<br/>
Guerilla millionaires, so don't even ask, if you wanna<br/>
get to clappin, soldier action specialty of style<br/>
We made the whole world respect the underground while<br/>
some of y'all niggaz talk shit and get mad<br/>
Cause we did it with a foot up your ass, and it's still there<br/>
I cares not about your click or the block<br/>
I'm still that same bitch to run up in your spot and knock you off<br/>
Broad, with the cause (yeah) bitch on a mission<br/>
Keep them niggaz by they nuts while you hoes be dick kissin<br/>
Missin the game, damn bitch it's written in plain ebonics<br/>
So shake that come-up off you brain and do the knowledge<br/>
Mia X, kickin off the ghetto symphony<br/>
Next soldier up, tell em who the FUCK you be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fiend]</i><br/>
WHUT?  It's Fiend y'all<br/>
Put me in the ring with real MC's, and watch em run for cover<br/>
and hidin in trees, to escape the mic that I breathe on<br/>
Bleed on, exceed on!<br/>
Weak rappers with titles after twelve<br/>
Hit a bell that's what I'll feed on!<br/>
Microphone Don, walkin flesh, talkin bomb<br/>
Bringin harm, to the calm, and, them be alarmed<br/>
It's the African, oh, you wanna battle again?<br/>
I'll turn, you and your mans, to my yesterday plans<br/>
Oh damn, totin two pistols like Yosemite Sam<br/>
Old man be grand, loud as the Southern band<br/>
Pickups and caravans, the soldier, that could, that can<br/>
I would be the man, but Dogg beat me to them plans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>

<i>[C-Murder]</i><br/>

Have you reminiscin and missin, that fool in your picture<br/>
Call me Bossalinie BITCH without the Mo's at shows<br/>
And FUCK dose who oppose (why?) we runnin them hoes<br/>
three-hundred and sixty-five motherfuckin days a year<br/>
I have your fool staggerin just like a bottle of beer<br/>
You niggaz runnin from the cops, well I ain't runnin no mo'<br/>
I flip the bird when I swerve, man, FUCK them hoes<br/>
I'm crazy my nagga, but uh, I thought y'all knew that, shit<br/>
Oh you ain't see the news?  Shit I'm the nigga with the TRU tat<br/>
Ask my nigga Keno, shit, I just don't give a fuck<br/>
And if you run up wrong, I'ma fuck you up, you bitch you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Silkk the Shocker]</i><br/>
Now would I COME THIS FAR FUCKER?  If I didn't sound like a hit<br/>
Y'all didn't know what the fuck y'all thinkin bout<br/>
You sound like a bitch (beotch!)<br/>
Shit it sound like a wish, you know when you got a motherfuckin hit,<br/>
bitch??  When it sound like this!<br/>
Or you fake niggaz get enough heart, and try to bust a<br/>
rhyme at this click<br/>
Fuck around and miss, then fuck around and get<br/>
found in a ditch<br/>
Gotta labels give me dough, when they find I can, gross this much<br/>
Freestyle shit, you can tell em I ain't, wrote this stuff<br/>
Silkk the Shocker, KLC perv and mash like, Snoop and Dre nigga<br/>
Y'all can relate to ??? ??? get a contract like, MJ nigga<br/>

<i>[Mystikal]</i><br/>
WHOO SHIT MOTHERFUCKER GOD DAMN!!<br/>

When the FUCK you ever heard somebody say that they don't say my song<br/>
or that I don't roll on every fuckin person RAPPIN ON<br/>
(That nigga Mystikal tighter than a muh'fucker) HAHHHHH?<br/>
I came up off of _Peter Piper_ bells and the LL's _Bad_<br/>
??Nee?? nigga to be pissed off with me<br/>
cause their old lady they call me their baby<br/>
MC's pilin up and crowdin up, but I'm their FAVORITE<br/>
The type to fly buyin a Z-28 IROC<br/>
And chop you in your motherfuckin face (HIII-YAH)<br/>
Your album ain't tite, WHAT IN THE FUCK IS YOU PUSHIN?<br/>
You played out just like old woman pussy<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Now watch me put these haters to the test, accumulatin with my stress<br/>
Fold em fuck em fifty, get the shit up off my chest<br/>
Releasin anger, all natural gangsta energy<br/>
Goldie Loc the name, Dogg House game<br/>
Motherfuckers better start backin up (whattup whattup)<br/>
We in the Tank punk busters, motherfuckers don't wanna see us loc'd up<br/>
Little Goldie Loc, Goldie Locks the same thang<br/>
Smashin for the hood, cause I wanted to gangbang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Last up, I believe that's me<br/>
Snoop Dogg, light up the mic for the symphony<br/>
<br/>
This jam is dedicated to all non-optimistics<br/>
That thought I wasn't comin, out with some exquisite, rhymes<br/>
But that's OK, cause now I'm back<br/>
To kill all the rumors, and straighten the facts<br/>
Like umm, doin bad, gettin ganked for my bank<br/>
Now you all on my dick when you see I'm TRU Tank Dogg<br/>
You say, "Mmmm mmm mmm!  Ain't that somethin<br/>
Dogg I bought yo' album, my nigga, that shit is bumpin<br/>
I apologize, I'm sorry for the drama<br/>
Can I get your autograph for my baby momma?"<br/>
Shit I'm settin it off, lettin it off, bustin<br/>
Hustlin, rushin, dustin motherfuckers<br/>
Droppin the heat, lock up the street, we 'posed to<br/>
I put this pistol in your mouth, now what you gon' do?<br/>
Top of the line, first class<br/>
I pop a cap in yo' ass, then pop some more in the glass<br/>
Too legit to quit, I'm spittin gangsta shit<br/>
Man fuck all that yappin, we bout that gun clappin<br/>
<br/>
No Limit, yeah, that's what's happenin<br/>
Fuck all that yappin, we bout that gun clappin<br/>
Yeah<br/>
In the real world, talk is cheap<br/>
Actions speak louder than words<br/>
No Limit Records, here to protect and serve
