<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Get on up to get down<br/>
And really go to town<br/>
And don't stop till you get enough<br/>
I wanna rock with you <br/>
Shake your stuff <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
Yo Yo, Doctor<br/>
Everybody hit the floor<br/>
Wild out till the security hit the door<br/>
I'm dirty<br/>
Gorilla paws, bang sugar walls<br/>
Hoes wanna pop E, hang with a Dogg<br/>
I told my man Snoop<br/>
She salmonilla<br/>
Got a ho with no dough with condoms with her<br/>
I'm a ride to the death of Def Squad on my chest<br/>
Look at it crook at it<br/>
Rob you and jet<br/>
Surprise you and flex<br/>
Funk in the Cadillac truck with a chicken, bobbing her neck<br/>
You done woke up and ain't trying to sleep<br/>
You done called up Hugh Heffer to find the freaks<br/>
I'mma stay on the street<br/>
I'mma stay saying 'fuck you' behind police<br/>
My mamma ain't raise no fool, she love me<br/>
That's why she hide my tool inside her room<br/>
I'm a jump, bump, throw that ass<br/>
Rough sex, I gotta fuck with shoulder pads<br/>
I'm like baby powder, ain't nann 'nother<br/>
Ain't nann ho getting Redman butter<br/>
And my man Gutter, DJ Murder Inc.<br/>
Ja know them hoes yo we can't love 'em<br/>
Underground the heat yeah I stay buzzing<br/>
Mixtapes I'm on the street they stay dubbing<br/>
Brick City riding,then 'bout it 'bout it<br/>
Shoot up you town then we Bin Ladin hidin'<br/>
Meth, show'em where the luger kept<br/>
Open your safe, show me where the food and vest<br/>
I hope when Dre hear this, he give a beat for ten more<br/>
Cause I stay on the corner like squegeemen<br/>
Yo Nate Dogg, what's happening y'all<br/>
Long Beach, Brick City<br/>
Scream at your frog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Everybody shaking<br/>
All these hoes around me<br/>
She was lost in the land of love<br/>
Glad that Nate Dogg found me<br/>
Girl you got a phatty<br/>
New York back to Cali<br/>
You know who got the bomb weed<br/>
Long Beach to Brick City<br/>
I know just want you want, I got just want you need<br/>
Turn that shit around, and back it up on me<br/>
Since I was the first, I guess I'll be the last to leave<br/>
D-O-double-G, will you keep it gangsta please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
I gots to do it<br/>
Yes Yes loc', we keep the best smoke<br/>
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk<br/>
I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke<br/>
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke<br/>
You want a problem, then lets go<br/>
Cause if not I came to disco<br/>
And freak this ho from Acopoqo<br/>
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride<br/>
Let's go we hit the hood slow<br/>
Post up, set up shop and press four<br/>
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough<br/>
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know<br/>
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke<br/>
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast<br/>
In the summertime<br/>
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion<br/>
Nigga watch how I handle mine<br/>
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this<br/>
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless<br/>
Square biz, you know what time it is<br/>
I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch<br/>
Now check dis, fact is<br/>
Put your back out, now back in<br/>
Go head wiggle it round you feeling me now<br/>
Girlfriend, you killing them now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
The way you shake your booty<br/>
It makes me want your booty<br/>
The way you shake your booty<br/>
Sure looks good to me <i>[2x]</i>
