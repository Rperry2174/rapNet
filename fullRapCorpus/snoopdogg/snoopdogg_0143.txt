(DEEZ NUTZ!!!) I'm almond with the caramel insides<br/>
You were playin front end with the french fries<br/>
How it feel man? What it look like?<br/>
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin on some Bud Light<br/>
Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper<br/>
Now put it in your mouth<br/>
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun<br/>
and I bet you can't just eat one (Candy!)<br/>
<br/>

<i>[MC Eiht]</i><br/>
I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint<br/>
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint<br/>
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate<br/>
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady<br/>
Yeah.. she my one and only<br/>
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me<br/>
I... feel... good about candy (Candy!)<br/>
My gangstas understand me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Shake it baby, don't break it baby, now can you make it clap? (clap!)<br/>
Tryna fit this work in your gap (gap!)<br/>
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on<br/>
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on<br/>
It's gettin sweeter than a sugar cane<br/>
Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs<br/>
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy<br/>
'Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy (Candy!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Daz Dillinger]</i><br/>
"It's like candy, candy!"<br/>
Get it how you want it<br/>
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner<br/>
While I, taadow, check out this bizarre<br/>
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z<br/>
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit<br/>
God damn! You already know who I am<br/>
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches<br/>
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?<br/>
Dip, drop, drop, dip<br/>
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
Yeah, nigga.. shot caller<br/>
It's America's number one baller<br/>
Man I don't give a fuck.. like, "Fuck it"<br/>
High riders.. slide in the bucket<br/>
Little momma all up on a nigga like a coat<br/>
I got the perfect thang that'll coat her throat (Candy!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ two extra lines]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg over Chorus]</i><br/>
Candy! So tasty.. candy, candy!<br/>
Yeah! Ha ha! Yeah nigga, we got that candy man<br/>
We don't sell it at the liquor store either man<br/>
We sell it everywhere we go<br/>
Holla, holla! (Candy!)<br/>
<br/>
Three thousand motherfuckin pieces, you understand me?<br/>
I wish a motherfucker would come in this motherfucker<br/>
If I see Suge right now, I'd tell him, "Hey, how you doin Suge?"<br/>
<i>[laughing]</i> I didn't even know you were standing there nigga<br/>
My bad!
