Ha, what ya got? <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Threat:]</i><br/>
It get hectic livin' life as a suspect<br/>
Ferocious out there, wild as a grizzly bear<br/>
Yo girl on a mission tryna jack ol boy for the cash<br/>
Two ski masks, strapped, where the yay at?<br/>
Ain't nothin' nice about the criminal life<br/>
Knives and guns and the chains and the teens in gangs<br/>
That done dropped outta school, he too cool<br/>
To read a book, see nook, crooks wind up on the news<br/>
The earth rattle, the over contaminated cattle<br/>
The enemies sail across seas to do battle<br/>
I know, I used to do those, now I'm retired<br/>
I desire not to have my soul burn fire<br/>
Everybody got a nickname and they clique bang<br/>
Rumble you can hear it through the concrete jungle<br/>
I spit it so well cause I see it all day<br/>
Homemade, pushin' sledge, spittin' gettin' that<br/>
Ladies say hey come close, I don't bite<br/>
I go to class durin' the day and I work at night<br/>
I go where I want and I do what I like<br/>
I'm pursuin' doin' plumbin', layin' down pipes (that's right)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
A million things run through my mind<br/>
And you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time<br/>
<br/>
Time brings change and change brings time<br/>
Just sit back and listen let me hit you wit a line<br/>
That I wrote and I quote that it's dope from the top<br/>
Please don't you quit, oh Snoop can't stop<br/>
I rock non stop when I have that mic<br/>
I give you motherfuckers just what ya like<br/>
You can bounce, you can pop, but just don't stop<br/>
Cause when I take the mic I plan to make your body rock<br/>
And don't you quit and don't you spit nothing to me<br/>
Cause you can't do me, why you talkin' madness you handed<br/>
Your microphone to your mouth now<br/>
You couldn't spit nothin' couldn't even turn it out, dumb ass<br/>
You got jealous and the fellas got mad at you<br/>
You couldn't do what the L.B.C. Crew do<br/>
You couldn't do what the D.P.G. niggas do<br/>
And you damn sure can't do what the L.A. zoo do<br/>
Try to stay true and try to get wit this<br/>
Niggas since Dogg was on the mic I'm too sick wit this<br/>
And when I come with some, boy I'm so ridiculous<br/>
Now shut the fuck up and listen while I'm kickin' this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
A million things run through my mind<br/>
And you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Threat:]</i><br/>
Killin' up crews give 'em the real street blues<br/>
Have 'em slidin' in they eel skins, groovin' in they tennis shoes<br/>
Of course I don't stop, being a west side rider<br/>
Wit no tattoos, that's how they got you<br/>
I make conversations on rappers CD's<br/>
And B.G.s and originals listen for the mission<br/>
Behind the wall, raise the shot call<br/>
Aimin' at the liberty blastin' artillery<br/>
My mental mind state is to build and create<br/>
And to weed out suckers, cremate motherfuckers<br/>
Mail through, put it down on your whole military<br/>
Pen ink scary like death at 13ths<br/>
<br/>
So all you alley cats get your eyes off the trash<br/>
And beware the bow wow cause I'm bitin' at your ass<br/>
And got you barkin' at the wrong tree, nigga<br/>
Can't you see we got the whole game locked like the penitentiary, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
What you watchin' the clock for?<br/>
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'...<br/>
Me and my niggas just keep on dippin'...<br/>
But I ain't set trippin'<br/>
Yeah... Throwin' down y'all<br/>
They fucked around and let some dogs in the zoo<br/>
I've never seen a dog at a zoo<br/>
True...<br/>
Oh yeah, west coast<br/>
(We are party people, Dogg Pound Gangstas are party people)
