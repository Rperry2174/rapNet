Hey yo Jim man <br/>
Why don't ya<br/>
You don't you kick some of that<br/>
You know, you know how you do it man<br/>
It's a trip people don't even believe were together right now (wow) <br/>
But tell your story, man<br/>
You know the one I like <br/>
Say it for me (Ride, ride, ride)<br/>
<br/>
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)<br/>
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)<br/>
Into this house we're born (Into this house we're born)<br/>
Into this world we're thrown (Into this world we're thrown)<br/>
Like a dog without a bone (Like a dog without a bone)<br/>
An actor out on loan(An actor out alone)<br/>
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)<br/>
<br/>
There's a killer on the road (Killer, Murder)<br/>
His brain is squirmin' like a toad<br/>
Take a long holiday (holidays, holidays)<br/>
Let your children play (play)<br/>
If ya give this man a ride<br/>
Sweet family will die (Die)<br/>
Killer on the road, yeah (Killer, Murder)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Goin' off of this roll off of that with the Lizard king<br/>
Bumpin' in the back (wow) how bout that (yeah)<br/>
Driftin', Liftin', Swiftin', coastin', Testaroastin'<br/>
But the wheels won't stop 200 (errrr) on the highway fresh<br/>
Up off the block he's a rider, na he's a killer dresses in all black<br/>
But his hat says Stella (Stella)<br/>
Pedal to the metal I gotta go hard<br/>
Drive by and say hello hey Fredwreck you my mello now let me<br/>
Hear what I sound like acapella (shhh) wow ride dip swish now<br/>
Bring it back just like this like a dog with out his bone unlike<br/>
A G with out his chrome it's hard to imagine the homey dog in a<br/>
Jag and he's checkin' for the checkered flag comin' in first never<br/>
In last cause my car to fast (zoom, zoom) I neva eva run out of<br/>
Gas cause I just to clean I do it upper class so fasten your seat<br/>
Belts it's so hot it will even make heat melt (woo, woo) so get a bowl<br/>
And roll and ride slip through the slip and slide<br/>
<br/>
Like a dog without a bone<br/>
An actor out on loan<br/>
Riders on the storm<br/>
There's a killer on the road<br/>
His brain is squirmin' like a toad<br/>
Take a long holiday<br/>
Let your children play<br/>
If ya give this man a ride<br/>
Sweet family will die<br/>
Killer on the road, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Away chameleon <br/>
<br/>
Need for speed I'm trying to take the lead hold on little homey<br/>
Before you run into the trees (watch out, watch out) I've seen things that<br/>
I would have never saw before hey yo Jim let'em in, let'em in open up<br/>
My back tire smokin' (errrr) the whole street and now the police wanna<br/>
Flash there lights and chase the Dogg all night (woof) but I won't pull over<br/>
Nor give up, 'cause I just don't give a fuck (What, What, What)<br/>
Yeah from the side boy where we was born and raised straight up to ride<br/>
Boy (west side) continuously, (continuously) we get to it expeditiously<br/>
Keep the light on east side on Snoop Dogg and The Doors<br/>
And yeah we bout to ride on<br/>
<br/>
Riders on the storm<br/>
Riders on the storm<br/>
Into this house we're born<br/>
Into this world we're thrown (were thrown)<br/>
Like a dog without a bone<br/>
An actor out on loan<br/>
Riders on the storm<br/>
<br/>
Riders on the storm <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
And let's ride
