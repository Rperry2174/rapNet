<i>[Intro: Wiz]</i><br/>
Uhh <i>[inhales]</i><br/>
Keep sayin I'll do this, I'll do that<br/>
But you know <i>[exhales]</i><br/>
I just keep doin the same shit<br/>
Haha, my fault, ha!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I'm not tryin to be right, tryin to be wrong<br/>
I'm just tryin to make it out here on my own<br/>
I say I do a lot of things but I'll (but I'll)<br/>
Probably never change (change)<br/>
I'm not tryin to be right, tryin to be wrong<br/>
I'm just tryin to make it out here on my own<br/>
I say I do a lot of things but I'll (but I'll)<br/>
Probably be the same (same)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Every time I try to get my life together someone sees<br/>
what you're doin, tryin to ruin my hopes and my dreams<br/>
Push away, and always gon' get away<br/>
It keeps them grams in my pants, never hit a day<br/>
Am I wrong? Am I right? Do I care? Livin life<br/>
On my own, cop a zone, what it feelin like<br/>
Transition, premonition, whatchacallit, Mac a bone<br/>
Do my thang with my gang, put your back up on<br/>
Recollect and reflect, on how I used to be<br/>
I'm probably the same way cuz cause I'm gon' keep it G<br/>
Secretly, sacredly, y'all wake and bake with me<br/>
Solo creepin on the dolo tippin like a low-low<br/>
Fans come in vans and clans expectin to get that photo<br/>
Or either come backstage and have a chance to hit my dodo<br/>
Cool individual, I'm never too good<br/>
See Mac is from the hood, and never Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, growin up I ain't know as much<br/>
I was too busy chasin money and rollin stuff 'fore I was old enough<br/>
Gettin every dollar and fold it up<br/>
Puttin all our weed in papers instead of blunts so they can know it's us<br/>
Every party we showin up<br/>
Baggie full of pre-rolls, light it up and pass it<br/>
You holdin that one too long nigga, matter fact you can have it<br/>
Another one in rotation, my motivation is cabbage<br/>
My Roley face filled with karats<br/>
And niggaz think they are but they know that they ain't comparin<br/>
And ain't doin no harm, I just don't think I'm into carin<br/>
I keep makin deposits and know ain't no interference from your broke ass<br/>
I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin mo' cash<br/>
And rollin weed, you smell the chronic when I go past<br/>
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad<br/>
Yeah I'm kinda high, but you should know that - hahaha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
