She's 'bout to go in<br/>
She likes that low end<br/>
Damn, her ass is so big<br/>
Just keep it bumpin'<br/>
Peaches and cream<br/>
<br/>
She too fly for words<br/>
And where I'm at now I'm too high for birds<br/>
Shorty what you think about my return?<br/>
Cuz what he think about it ain't my concern<br/>
I ain't come for you I came for your missus<br/>
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players<br/>
Well okay, I do it for the riches<br/>
But in the mean time and in-between time<br/>
Shorty right there gon' get it<br/>
If she with it if she ain't<br/>
Then I know her partner down cuz her partner throwin shots<br/>
Every time I turn around, and her partner bringing partners every time I come to town<br/>
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher<br/>
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right there<br/>
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs<br/>
And when I come down he can bring it back word<br/>
<br/>
She's 'bout to go in<br/>
She likes that low end<br/>
Damn, her ass is so big<br/>
Just keep it bumpin'<br/>
Peaches and cream<br/>
<br/>
Uh oh there she goes<br/>
That's that look all on her face<br/>
Shorty dancing like she knows<br/>
She's the baddest in the place<br/>
Hey, hey, I wanna get with you<br/>
Freak, don't fail me now<br/>
Hey, so what you wanna do?<br/>
Got her freak-um dress on<br/>
Them newbies on her feet<br/>
And them bottles with the sparkles<br/>
So the other girls can see that she's...<br/>
Paid, I wanna get with you<br/>
Freak, don't fail me now<br/>
Hey, so what you wanna do?<br/>
<br/>
I came to cut right now<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg and I came to get down<br/>
Yes, I'm internationally known<br/>
Libra lovin' make you moan and groan<br/>
Burn my gas like race cars<br/>
Two bad broads with the bass on<br/>
I never met a girl that I'd wait for<br/>
I seal my deal like Jay does<br/>
I'm all that and then some<br/>
Pimp real for real when I win some<br/>
I remember what you're thinking<br/>
Black shades on drinking while you're blinking<br/>
Something fly, white limousine<br/>
Make a clean getaway<br/>
I love the clothes, what you about<br/>
The way you let it out<br/>
<br/>
She's 'bout to go in<br/>
She likes that low end<br/>
Damn, her ass is so big<br/>
Just keep it bumpin'<br/>
Peaches and cream<br/>
<br/>
Uh oh there she goes<br/>
That's that look all on her face<br/>
Shorty dancing like she knows<br/>
She's the baddest in the place<br/>
Hey, hey, I wanna get with you<br/>
Freak, don't fail me now<br/>
Hey, so what you wanna do?<br/>
Got her freak-um dress on<br/>
Them newbies on her feet<br/>
And them bottles with the sparkles<br/>
So the other girls can see that she's...<br/>
Paid, I wanna get with you<br/>
Freak, don't fail me now<br/>
Hey, so what you wanna do?<br/>
<br/>
Everybody in the world<br/>
Here we go<br/>
Fill your body with the smoke<br/>
And that's the way it goes<br/>
<br/>
She's 'bout to go in<br/>
She likes that low end<br/>
Damn, her ass is so big<br/>
Just keep it bumpin'<br/>
Peaches and cream<br/>
<br/>
Uh oh there she goes<br/>
That's that look all on her face<br/>
Shorty dancing like she knows<br/>
She's the baddest in the place<br/>
Hey, hey, I wanna get with you<br/>
Freak, don't fail me now<br/>
Hey, so what you wanna do?
