<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Pimp<br/>
Its pimp shit, its pimp shit<br/>
Nigga said his bitch took him to court for child support<br/>
Its cheaper to keep her<br/>
Cheaper to keep her<br/>
Thats real talk<br/>
Cheaper to keep her<br/>
Thats real talk, its cheaper to keep her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now if you don't think I know what the fuck i'm talkin bout<br/>
(What you talkin bout?)<br/>
Run down to the Dogg House, and see fo' yo own two eyes<br/>
Bitches try to pull snake moves to get a piece of the pie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Its impossible, to stop a ho<br/>
So let her go, and get the dough<br/>
Lead the way, or step aside<br/>
Break a bitch till the day I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Check me out, no doubt, I flip the game and re-route<br/>
I check her in wit Magic Man Juan, or Pimpin Ken<br/>
I just got back from Milwaukee, the All-Star game<br/>
Not the NBA nigga, i'm talkin real playa shit mayne<br/>
Macks, ballas, hustlas, and prostitutes<br/>
On the real my nig, you got to, got to get the loot<br/>
And if you got to shoot to get the loot<br/>
Then I guess you got to do what you gotta do<br/>
But know this, fa sho this, its somethin for realler<br/>
From a fifty cent nigga to a thousand dollar nigga<br/>
Fuck George Bush, the army, and the G.I.<br/>
Nigga this P.I., until I D.I.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Goldie Loc]</i><br/>
Now don't get mad when you see me wit ya girlfriend<br/>
She ridin shot gun, smokin the damn thang again<br/>
Now say it ain't true...<br/>
Baby you gank em and play em it ain't no ring on you<br/>
That ain't what I do, just because I spend time wit you<br/>
Don't really mean i'm lyin to you<br/>
You got to understand what this young pimp will say<br/>
Cause right about now, it ain't no time for play<br/>
Now watch me slap ya ass wit dicks, bitch<br/>
You was stricly dickly, why you turn clitly<br/>
Thats even better, now both of you bitches lick me<br/>
Then I sit back and watch y'all eat pussy<br/>
Kick off my feet and count my cheese<br/>
Snoop this ain't the XLF, this the P-I-M-P<br/>
Look, she think she burned out<br/>
Wait until I put her on the fast track and have her turned out<br/>
P.I!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Lil pretty skinny ass bitch, but she gotta monkey<br/>
I know she suck dicks cause her lips nice and puffy<br/>
But she got the wrong thought, kinda got me turned off<br/>
Must be why she sweatin me, the ectasy she gon off<br/>
For realler, ho don't know i'm bout that scrilla<br/>
I peel her like a sunkiss for comin wit that dumb shit(stupid bitch!)<br/>
I keeps the P.I., poppin fa sho<br/>
Other suckas tend to love em, we just cop em and blow<br/>
Hos come, hos go, hos runnin ya slow<br/>
So keep her foot up in her ass, unless a dick in her throat<br/>
Main grew bitch will go what I make ya do<br/>
And keep ya eyes on my Stacys while i'm lacin you<br/>
Ya like sex and shit, and gettin naked quick<br/>
Ya lil wreckless bitch, so gon and check them chips<br/>
And bring every penny back home and deck<br/>
And pull a couple of mo' hos you know that wanna get wrecked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
