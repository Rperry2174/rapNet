<i>[KRS-One:]</i><br/>
Yeah! La la la...<br/>
What up Snoop?<br/>
KRS in the building<br/>
Listen! Listen!<br/>
<br/>
Too much brr brr brr<br/>
Too many people getting brred <i>[?]</i><br/>
All you hear is brr brr brr in the streets<br/>
People grip and they eat just to settle they beefs<br/>
Brr brr<br/>
Now you getting chased by police<br/>
You running to the west, running to the east<br/>
But the problem is you under the beast<br/>
Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased<br/>
We need peace<br/>
Not brr in the streets<br/>
The brr in Iraq lasts for weeks<br/>
Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps<br/>
Every time I spit they get weak<br/>
Knowledge reigns supreme<br/>
I take you back to the days when the telephone used to brring<br/>
I'm reading the sacred script<br/>
KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Let us begin<br/>
What, where, why or when?<br/>
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen<br/>
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in<br/>
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in<br/>
Blast master, blast faster<br/>
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters<br/>
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us<br/>
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous<br/>
<br/>
By any means necessary, peeking out the window<br/>
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders<br/>
Thinking how the rap game was<br/>
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love<br/>
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring<br/>
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang<br/>
So I try to show the little homies different things<br/>
How to diversify, and change different lanes<br/>
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain<br/>
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game<br/>
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't<br/>
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace<br/>
The honorable speaks<br/>
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep<br/>
Cause it's truth<br/>
What's that? You don't like that?<br/>
Well we fight back. And we'll be right back<br/>
<br/>
Let us begin<br/>
What, where, why or when?<br/>
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen<br/>
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in<br/>
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in<br/>
Blast master, blast faster<br/>
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters<br/>
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us<br/>
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous
