You can't run away, run away<br/>
You gotta face this<br/>
You can't run away, run away<br/>
You gotta face this<br/>
Time is moving fast<br/>
Can't dwell on the past<br/>
Make this moment last<br/>
While we have the chance<br/>
Old dreams look fake<br/>
For the new one's made<br/>
Nothing stays the same<br/>
Do it the rebel way<br/>
<br/>
From moonlight to sunrise<br/>
Day in and day out<br/>
I stay on my<br/>
Modus operandi<br/>
Opening my third eye<br/>
Focus on the words I say<br/>
Man stand a diligent, militant<br/>
With the sentiment, I'm here to represent<br/>
Constant changes like passing raises<br/>
Evident, the time we spend is sacred<br/>
<br/>
You can't run away, run away<br/>
You gotta face this<br/>
You can't run away, run away<br/>
You gotta face this<br/>
Time is moving fast<br/>
Can't dwell on the past<br/>
Make this moment last<br/>
While we have the chance<br/>
Old dreams look fake<br/>
For the new one's made<br/>
Nothing stays the same<br/>
Do it the rebel way<br/>
<br/>
We still drop it hardcore<br/>
Nuff of them can't take it<br/>
When the lion roar<br/>
We no take no shorts, tell 'em we want more<br/>
Now it's time to settle the score<br/>
For all of my people in the ghetto streets reppin<br/>
And all who feel they've been stepped on<br/>
Love is the cure and courage is the weapon<br/>
You can use to overcome<br/>
<br/>
You can't run away, run away<br/>
You gotta face this<br/>
You can't run away, run away<br/>
You gotta face this<br/>
Time is moving fast<br/>
Can't dwell on the past<br/>
Make this moment last<br/>
While we have the chance<br/>
Old dreams look fake<br/>
For the new one's made<br/>
Nothing stays the same<br/>
Do it the rebel way<br/>
<br/>
Do it the rebel way <i>[x13]</i>
