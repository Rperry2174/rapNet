<i>[Stresmatic &amp; Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I can send a missile<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
Eyes peeled when I wiggle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
This is not a starter pistol (No, no)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
If you need me just whistle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
From the depths of the sea<br/>
Blowing trees in the big leagues<br/>
I got a plan, I'm going ham on all you DBs<br/>
You better double me up, safety cover me up<br/>
Single coverage won't work boy, I'll burn him up<br/>
Give me the damn ball, move the chains at the same time<br/>
Dressed to impress when it's game time, flame mine<br/>
I'm wide open, hoping, scoping out the sea<br/>
Catch a quick screen, cake walk on your whole team<br/>
Will he beam, will he run, will he walk, talk, or will he lean<br/>
I need riders and goons when I build a team<br/>
I get it cracking with the snap of the wrist<br/>
It's nothing less than a championship, now peep this<br/>
<br/>
Call a few plays then break the huddle<br/>
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal<br/>
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80<br/>
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stressmatic &amp; Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I can send a missile<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
Eyes peeled when I wiggle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
This is not a starter pistol (No, no)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
If you need me just whistle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I'm in full beast mode, too code to be cut down<br/>
Lifting weights, staying in shape, won't be shut down<br/>
Antonio Brown or Julio Jones<br/>
One on each side, now who do you zone<br/>
They on me like a bloodhound cause I won't go down<br/>
It's like a merry-go-round the way I'm bending my routes<br/>
I'm so sick with this, they can't stick me<br/>
Stick to to this<br/>
Sports Illustrated, get a flick of this<br/>
Lost him, cross him, quarterback toss<br/>
Highest point homie had the Randy Moss him<br/>
One hand as I shook him off me<br/>
Some OBJ with a dab of that DJ coffin, get off me<br/>
<br/>
Call a few plays then break the huddle<br/>
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal<br/>
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80<br/>
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stressmatic &amp; Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I can send a missile<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
Eyes peeled when I wiggle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
This is not a starter pistol (No, no)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
If you need me just whistle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
If you play wing back, slot end, or receiver<br/>
You got to outwork your opponent or you won't receive a<br/>
Pass from the quarterback cause he's under pressure<br/>
They get a couple 1DB's about to press up<br/>
Looking apart from the start, on the dress up<br/>
Coach on the play, I'm hoping that he don't mess up<br/>
Ayy back up off me, you playing me close<br/>
You bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast<br/>
I rock it out and find my way into the endzone<br/>
A couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone<br/>
I tell 'em "Cool," I keep my head in the game<br/>
Cause I'm ahead of the game and I'm a veteran man<br/>
<br/>
Call a few plays then break the huddle<br/>
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal<br/>
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80<br/>
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stressmatic &amp; Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I can send a missile<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
Eyes peeled when I wiggle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
This is not a starter pistol (No, no)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
If you need me just whistle<br/>
I got my head on a swivel, swivel<br/>
I got my head on a swivel<br/>
A swivel
