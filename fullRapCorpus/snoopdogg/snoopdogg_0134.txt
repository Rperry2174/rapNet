<i>[Chorus - Justin Timberlake (Uncle Charlie Wilson)]</i><br/>
I'm not sure what I see<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse - Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>

You know he's in - tune with the season<br/>
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?<br/>
Tell me if it's weed that you needing<br/>

Where helicopters got cameras, just to get a glimpse of our Chucks<br/>
And our Khakis and our bouncer cars<br/>
You wit you friend right? (yeah)<br/>

Mami, mamasita, have you ever - flown on G5s<br/>
From London - to Ibiza. You gotta have Cape Town<br/>
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas<br/>
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena<br/>
And I can take you (Uncle Charlie, preach!!)<br/>

Nigga don't be young and foolish<br/>
You don't know what you're doing<br/>
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (gone)<br/>
And her pretty face, drove you wild<br/>
But you ain't got that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style<br/>
