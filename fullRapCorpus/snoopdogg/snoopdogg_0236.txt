<i>[Verse 1 – Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Big Mac, Big Sack, Like This, Like That<br/>
Big Man on Campus, I’ll be Right Back<br/>
Like Mike, Like Max, My Life, My Fight<br/>
Menace<br/>
Mo’ business in the beginning<br/>
But hoes stupid<br/>
But ended up bein a chemist<br/>
24/7, Dev, my nigga committed<br/>
Classmates<br/>
Ended up as my roll dog<br/>
I showed him how to live<br/>
How to ball till we fall<br/>
Harder it is, make you much smarter dog<br/>
Follow instructions, changed up the dialogue<br/>
Manifest, no stress<br/>
Life is a big test<br/>
Will you fail? Or will you pass?<br/>
Smoke grass, trim trees<br/>
Tryin to find some air to breath<br/>
Messed up, please baby, baby please<br/>
Diplomas, Gowns, Caps and Degrees<br/>
These are necessities<br/>
In life ya need<br/>
Some gone and did it<br/>
Focus, Committed<br/>
15 years later, the year a nigga finally did it<br/>
Now who’s to say in life is up, slow down?<br/>
And when you get up, you gotta get down.<br/>
And when you get up, look around<br/>
And don’t frown on the ones that down<br/>
Just give ‘em a hand<br/>
It’s like mix and fixin up pots and pans<br/>
Listen up, I’m poppin up like rockin the band<br/>
No playin, all from the heart to the hand<br/>
We gon roll it, smoke it, and do it again.<br/>
I’m the apprentice<br/>
Back on my pimp shit<br/>
Roll it, puff it, now give it to him<br/>
Physical fitness<br/>
Smokin’ relentless<br/>
Nouns and pronouns, they make up my sentence<br/>
High School days. Blowin on the purple haze<br/>
High School days. Blowin on the purple haze<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 – Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
And you know everywhere that we go if it’s there for its Mac then we blow it by the O<br/>
Niggas know me for rollin’ the OGs on someone low key, twistin a whole bush<br/>
And if I got it, then you can get it; it’s on us<br/>
Smoke so much product that they prolly give me my own kush<br/>
We blow it by the zone<br/>
Break down, blow it at a bone<br/>
Take you to my crib and show you how to roll, bro<br/>
And my pockets lookin kinda swole<br/>
Me and Mac smoking Grade A on a roll<br/>
Now all of the teachers on us<br/>
They can have contact cuz I keep diplomas<br/>
Car automatic don’t need the key to start it<br/>
Know it’s us juzt cuz of the weed aroma<br/>
Lookin for me, nigga, I’m in the tree department<br/>
With a doobie rolled up in a secret compartment<br/>
Tryin to finish up this speech and get my diploma<br/>
So I can a career where my OG can harvest<br/>
And my niggas can ball<br/>
I’m talkin so much weed that there’s shit in the walls<br/>
It start growing the spring and get picked in the fall<br/>
I’m used to goin to every class, but I’m missin them all<br/>
Fuckin with Mac, smoking spliffs in the hall<br/>
Singing this song like<br/>
Niggas know me, blowin on the OG<br/>
Niggas know me, blowin on the OG<br/>
Niggas know me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
High School Niggas<br/>
Dev and Mac, Mac and Dev<br/>
Put it in a Zag<br/>
Put it in a Blunt<br/>
Do what you want
