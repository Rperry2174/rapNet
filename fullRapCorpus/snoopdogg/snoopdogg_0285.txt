Snoop Dogg<br/>
They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit<br/>
5-7 clean, that's that big boy whip<br/>
State Seattles mean, that's them big boy kicks<br/>
The way I mack at a bitch, that's the big boy spit<br/>
King of the coach, yeah, I earned my due<br/>
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah, I earned that shoe<br/>
Been around the world, did my time in the pen<br/>
Niggas in gangbangs is back on them swings<br/>
So how could you ever disrespect my place?<br/>
Since '93 strong I was all in your face<br/>
Big shows in arenas, bitches picker than Trina<br/>
Party like rock stars at the bars where I seen her<br/>
Made my move closely, you owe me<br/>
I had you in the club for 10 years sipping slowly<br/>
To my shit classics and all it was was keeping it true<br/>
I brought the west back, what did you do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Ain't nobody better than me<br/>
True hood rock star in me<br/>
Ain't nobody better than me<br/>
S-S-N-double O-E<br/>
<br/>
Slow motion in the fast lane<br/>
Feeling so alone blowing domes in the crap game<br/>
Sitting at the top of the game where you ain't<br/>
Got every type of car so now I just play the paint<br/>
Show after show, bank row in the Rolls<br/>
Living nice, big slice, got me slamming cans a doors<br/>
Three piece suit with a pocket watch<br/>
Snoop comin on<i>[?]</i>, you all riding chrome like you gotta stop soon<br/>
Did it the G way, he say, she say<br/>
Peer pressure to me, way to stop, bang in the seat way<br/>
I was the hog in the streets<br/>
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats<br/>
The slow flow killed and people said I rapped like I was chilling<br/>
Way above the stars, Snoop Dogg is top feeling<br/>
Plastics and all it was was keeping it true<br/>
I brought the west back, what did you do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Who get it like I done it? (Nobody)<br/>
You just in it, nigga, I run it<br/>
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills<br/>
Like I can't get in your grill cause I live in the hills<br/>
Snoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said<br/>
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I've fed<br/>
Young ass buster, let me see your ID<br/>
I just chunked up a bill passing VIP<br/>
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A on me<br/>
Been crippin', been pimpin', been doing the do<br/>
See me walking and that whole world doing it too<br/>
They play follow the leader, boss on the move<br/>
Shot down to the shoes, man I brunk on shoes<br/>
Cotis at the mall, I've been keeping it truth<br/>
I brought the west back, what the fuck did you do, nigga?<br/>
<br/>
