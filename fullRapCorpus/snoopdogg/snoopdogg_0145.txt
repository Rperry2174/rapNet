<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
West Coast... it's time to stand up nigga<br/>
We gon' unite 'round this motherfucker one time<br/>
I'm callin' every real Crip nigga<br/>
and every real B-Dogg, to the table right now<br/>
Yeah... we gon' push a real line right now<br/>
See if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen 100,000 Rip riders from the side<br/>
Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies<br/>
On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues<br/>
Niggaz gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray<br/>
these suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news<br/>
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move<br/>
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far<br/>
Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park<br/>
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail<br/>
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail<br/>
4800 with this Crippin', oh well<br/>
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail<br/>
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right<br/>
Eyes open 'cause niggaz get stuck on seez-ight<br/>
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock<br/>
Never flip-flop, 20 Crippin' til I drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip<br/>
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot<br/>
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip<br/>
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot<br/>
Ca-rip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Game]</i><br/>
Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5<br/>
With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview<br/>
Niggaz see clear through, they know that it's Game<br/>
Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang<br/>
So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"<br/>
I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered<br/>
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies<br/>
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy<br/>
And bang for my niggaz locked up, they can't stop us<br/>
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up<br/>
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on<br/>
Hughey P. Lewis with Air Force One's on<br/>
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams<br/>
Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'<br/>
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked<br/>
Red and blue rag tied in a knot<br/>
With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot<br/>
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip<br/>
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot<br/>
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Game]</i><br/>
I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck<br/>
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's<br/>
Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go<br/>
Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4<br/>
We "Just Dippin", one Bloodin' one Crippin'<br/>
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen<br/>
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side<br/>
So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'<br/>
Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet<br/>
Stop, and C-Walk to the beat<br/>
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street<br/>
Eastside LBC, gun in my hand<br/>
It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand<br/>
We just - slip and slide out, we Rip and ride out<br/>
Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip<br/>
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot<br/>
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip<br/>
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot<br/>
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot<br/>
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip...
