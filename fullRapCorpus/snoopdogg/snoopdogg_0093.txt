<i>[Kokane &amp; {Snoop Dogg}]</i><br/>
Oh.......Chassa-dee<br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}<br/>
From the LBC<br/>
Chassa-dee<br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}<br/>
La da da da da da da<br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}<br/>
From the LB....LB<br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
What up cuz? You know aint nothin different on mines<br/>
When I hit up motherfuckers with that look in my eyes<br/>
It's a statement that I'm makin and aint takin no backtalk<br/>
I'm blowin niggaz hats off as soon as my gat cough<br/>
The last thought you rappin niggaz should think<br/>
Is you can never get a scratch with Tray Deee on the beat<br/>
On the streets over beef you dont compete with uno - you know<br/>
The general a criminal do low<br/>
Admit cuz I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it<br/>
Niggaz timid in my vision I cause tension and thinkin<br/>
By my presence I'm a answer to society's hate<br/>
A true rider with the mind - I pushed him outta his way<br/>
Fools petty and they ready steady comin with bullshit<br/>
A full clip with jewell will hit like a mule kick<br/>
A sure hit is all I'm aiming for when I blast<br/>
Motherfuckers hit the deck once I go in the dash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:  Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now is the time<br/>
This is the place<br/>
To bang back the khakis with the church fat lace<br/>
West is the coast, east is the side<br/>
Long Beach is the city where them gangstas ride<br/>
Money brings power, power brings respect<br/>
Disrespect the set I gotsta grab the tech<br/>
This is how it goes and thats how it's done<br/>
Eastside 2-1 in the land of the fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
Niggaz how ya figure that the game gon' wait<br/>
I came home straight from the pen to take your place<br/>
Aint no chase this paper comin soon as I post up<br/>
And watch the victom's clock and catch him choppin his dough up<br/>
Fuck the his host up stripped, gagged and roped up<br/>
Take the whole cut and he be sure negotiative<br/>
I'm ruthless I shoot crips and bloods alike<br/>
Thug for life - come and catch the slug tonight<br/>
Insane mental frame feel no shame or pitty<br/>
Since the game is shitty I gotsta bang the city<br/>
Trippin gangstas so I brang the terroristical heat<br/>
Grab strap jacket mack to reach the tinted to peep<br/>
This is the beach now any nigga got a rebuttal<br/>
Kobe eatin what he speakin once he cant get the muzzle<br/>
Struggle hard for my title and intend to hold it<br/>
You want it? Then all invitations open<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
I take seven old B's put 'em in the street<br/>
Then thats seven more busta's who claim they got heat<br/>
And then it takes seven more C's before I start to reach<br/>
Then thats 2-1 for the set now lets stretch out in the streets<br/>
Tray Deee never do it easy fool so dont expect it<br/>
Niggas get checked and they sets disrespected<br/>
No question I'm all you ever thought that you was<br/>
Till you ran across the boss and now you coughin up blood<br/>
Shoot first fools curse before they kick up dust<br/>
Clip gon' bust then they gonna have to pick loc up<br/>
All they talkin cause I'm chalkin whole districts off<br/>
Since this loss a purple nigga's piss me off<br/>
Conflict with my clique get your bitch ass touched<br/>
All my comrads bomb back it's as sick as fuck<br/>
2-1 till I'm done never run from the turf<br/>
Check the badge boy we mash on run get it even worse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kokane &amp; {Snoop Dogg}]</i><br/>
<i>[Kokane mumbling until the end]</i><br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}<br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}<br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}<br/>
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}
