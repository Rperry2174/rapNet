Ay whassup my nig?<br/>
Shit, just chillin, what's happenin?<br/>
Shit nuttin, whatchu up to?<br/>
Shit, not too much - ay you ain't seen that nigga Snoop?<br/>
Man hell naw, I been callin that nigga since Starsky &amp; Hutch<br/>
I ain't fin' to call that nigga no more man<br/>
Tchk, oh like that?<br/>
Man f'real man, I ain't buyin that new album either<br/>
I'ma download that motherfucker for free<br/>
Let that nigga know when I see him man<br/>
Shit, there he go right there<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I don't say much<br/>
I don't say Alize, no I don't say Dutch<br/>
Keep yo' hands off until I say, okay touch<br/>
I never come off tacky, I'm a boss exactly<br/>
I'm like the slick suit Snooperfly Versace<br/>
Conversation flashy, y'all niggaz can't match me<br/>
I talk to you slow, so your game can roll<br/>
Take advice from a player, don't love her just play her<br/>
Boy I never could dare, to pay double the fare<br/>
Man I swear to God it's gon' be some trouble in here<br/>
Before I pay that bitch, I'm like a bossy hog<br/>
Half dog, half gorilla, bitch Donkey Kong<br/>
Niggaz thirst for hoes, I got a thirst to ball<br/>
Tryin to knock a pimp's hustle, be the first to fall<br/>
Fuckin with a-hundred-fifty, whole can of vodka<br/>
Mixed with gangbang, got a program like Poppa (hey hold up man)<br/>
I'ma do you a favor, let this pimpin save ya<br/>
Leave that bitch alone, the homies call her Ms. Behavior<br/>
Boy you move too fast, done too much talkin<br/>
I'm too much walkin to one who keep hoes hawkin<br/>
Don't fuck with Snoop too much cause he goes off when<br/>
niggaz mouth too much, so please no flossin<br/>
I step up quicker, cause the game don't pause<br/>
I gotta stay sucka free, cause it ain't no laws<br/>
Dig this y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
That's the bidness mayne, step my game up up in this mayne<br/>
Long hours hard minutes mayne, with this hustle on splendid mayne<br/>
P.A. perfect attendance mayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Cause I'm a boss..<br/>
Yeah, real bossy like, and sometimes flossy<br/>
And if you fuckin with that<br/>
{"I-I know, I, I-I-know, I know you gonna dig this"}<br/>
<br/>
I had to tell you the truth homey, but you got mad<br/>
Yeah I hurt yo' feelings, FUCK IT, it's too damn bad<br/>
I'm a major player, I got major game<br/>
I might floss a different bitch, but the pimpin the same<br/>
I ain't got time for no haters, I lay 'em flat on they back<br/>
I'm from the Dogg Pound homey, I don't fuck with them cats<br/>
I fuck with, niggaz, who be bustin them shots<br/>
I'm talkin Long Beach, Inglewood, Compton, Watts<br/>
Close your chops, I knows your spots<br/>
Keep talkin nigga I'll expose your knots<br/>
You ain't ready for daddy, boy I do this for fun<br/>
It's like you versus Kobe ballin one on one<br/>
You ain't got no chance, you ain't got no fans<br/>
I kick the shit out you punk, look momma no hands<br/>
I'm not a, holy roller but I pray so hard<br/>
Help me, I'm sendin these bitch niggaz straight to God<br/>
Shit I'm too damn grown, conversation is sho't<br/>
While your talk is funny, Jack I talk with money<br/>
Keep the chain on bling, the rock is sunny<br/>
For you smart mouthted bitches I ain't that dummy<br/>
{"HELL NO," he replied}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
{"GOD DAMN!"} {"Let me tell you somethin"}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
That's the bidness, that's the bidness<br/>
Aww, that's the bidness, can I get a witness?<br/>
Aww, yeah, that's the bidness, aww yeah, say what, yeah<br/>
That's the bidness, but can I get a witness?
