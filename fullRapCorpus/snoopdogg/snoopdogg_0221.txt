<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Winners, everybody wants to be a winner<br/>
Winning is everything uh, nah, winning it’s the only thing<br/>
<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game,<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game,<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I can jump out the jet, I can run, I can swim<br/>
I am heavy on the case, I stay in first place<br/>
Mud on my shoes, taste blood on my face<br/>
Out of town, touch down never out of bounds<br/>
I train for the gold, I can go twelve rounds<br/>
Steal city baby, we are super bowl bound<br/>
Recollect a stack while I check a checker flag<br/>
All this winning got me grinning<br/>
All this losing got you mad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
No more Chuck T’s on my feet, it’s just Adidas<br/>
Man they kept it true to the streets<br/>
And like he C, I’m on a 50 game win streak<br/>
I can’t be beat, I am the real heat<br/>
Real king real rings, that’s what we say<br/>
I threw a shirt out and cut out I’m on my way<br/>
PGA car under he may play?<br/>
It’s what amazing happens in the NBA, eh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Eo, we don’t take them on the west side<br/>
Yeah, I was born to be the best right<br/>
Rest and sleep is for the weak<br/>
The last shot y’all can go and put it on me<br/>
The last swing, the last throw, double U is all a dog know<br/>
W-I-N, W-E-S-T OG, Snoop D-O Double G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game,<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game,<br/>
Winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang<br/>
When you’re living life in the game,<br/>
<br/>
No matter what game it is, winning it ain’t everything, it’s the only thang<br/>
And make sure you go hard, blood sweat and tears<br/>
Shout out to all the winners out there<br/>
That’s all I do is win, ya digg? It ain’t easy<br/>
Congratulations, winner.
