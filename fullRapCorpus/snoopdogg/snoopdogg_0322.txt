Dogg, what up, mane?<br/>
Word on the streets is you ain't what you used to be<br/>
<br/>
I gang bang to the fullest<br/>
A lot of niggas talk about it but they really don't do it, do they?<br/>
So I'm doin' it for y'all<br/>
Marco, I bust, I'ma ruin it for y'all<br/>
Stomp that, strap up, mash up<br/>
And get it crackin' with the slapper, jacker<br/>
Smacker, rapper? Nah nigga, that ain't me<br/>
Gangsta? Yeah nigga, can't you see?<br/>
Rider, like the tonners on my Chevrolet<br/>
West Coast, motherfucker, that's the only way<br/>
Yeah homie, what you say?<br/>
Home of the Wook, Wok and Gunplay<br/>
A lot of homies shoot to J<br/>
But most of 'em prefer to shoot the K<br/>
Yeah, that's the good life<br/>
And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life<br/>
Where you mama and daddy<br/>
Told to set up out the room while they swingin' the caddy<br/>
That's on the set, tats on they neck<br/>
Streets sweet with the heat, yep, they stay on deck<br/>
I'm dazed and blazed, no confusin', I'm choosin'<br/>
This how I was raised<br/>
I bring that out and bag it up, no doubt<br/>
Swing it out and let it up and bang that out<br/>
This Crips, nigga<br/>
<br/>
That's crazy, cuz<br/>
You know my whole life, I wanted to be a gangsta, mane<br/>
I used to see my OG home boys at King Park<br/>
Ridin' on bikes but they came with they flags on the end<br/>
See Stacey Adams, fine woman<br/>
That shit was fast and late<br/>
<br/>
The Miles Davis of gangbangin' and crack slangin'<br/>
Drivin' a fresh rock, run 'em with blocks in 'em<br/>
Fresh out the county, I'm boxin' 'em<br/>
Moved on up and bought a continental, nigga, I'm knockin' it<br/>
Now I'm rockin' it, '61 blockin' it<br/>
If y'all ridin' by, my nigga, we cockin' it<br/>
We poppin' on imposters, fake ass mobsters<br/>
East side niggas, ain't no stoppin' us<br/>
My recipe is treachery<br/>
The best in me, nigga, the West to be<br/>
A better place for the one of Ace<br/>
Put a 9 millimetre in your fuckin' face<br/>
And let you say your grace before you have a taste<br/>
Of reality, set in, yeah, this your fate<br/>
Now your homies at your funeral<br/>
Plottin' on some get back<br/>
But you can't get back 'cause nigga, you dated<br/>
Another sad gangsta story<br/>
And usually ones with the territory<br/>
No nuts, no glory<br/>
No pain, no gain<br/>
Life for a nigga growin' up in the game<br/>
This slangin' thang<br/>
Drinkin', sell a lil' cocaine<br/>
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it<br/>
Now everybody know me<br/>
They watchin' the makings of a real OG<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they say if you watch somethin' long enough, you'll become it<br/>
You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery<br/>
That's what I was told<br/>
A lot of niggas is imitatin' me 'cause real gangsta shit<br/>
You ain't cut from it<br/>
You dig?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, scarin' all the white folk<br/>
While stayin' on the right note<br/>
And you can quote me if you want to<br/>
Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon' do?<br/>
I'm live in the flesh<br/>
Caught him on Imperial left five in his chest<br/>
Survive in the west<br/>
It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go blam<br/>
And how you like me now?<br/>
Crip 'til you slip, Mr. Big Bow Wow<br/>
Yeah, it's my chance to prance<br/>
I got ants in my pants and I needs to dance<br/>
I go for broke, no joke<br/>
I gotta put my drink down, I'm tryna C walk, loc<br/>
See I'ma take off, break off<br/>
And make off with the cash<br/>
At the pad with, a thick lil bitch, she super bad<br/>
<br/>
Gangsta, gangsta<br/>
Futuristic<br/>
Snoop Dogg<br/>
48 hunnid<br/>
C's up, yeah<br/>
Shoot or shout out to my home boys<br/>
Harlem 30<br/>
Yeah, real shit<br/>
All my niggas on the East coast<br/>
6-0's, Eight Tray, Hoovers<br/>
Main Street, all my niggas in Compton<br/>
And the South side, ya dig?<br/>
Nutty Blocc<br/>
Santana<br/>
Oh, can't forget them Long Beach niggas<br/>
East side the same<br/>
Rollin 20 Crips<br/>
19th Street<br/>
West side, you know what's hatnin'<br/>
Saten Day, West Coast<br/>
North side on the block<br/>
All hood, yeah<br/>
Crip shit
