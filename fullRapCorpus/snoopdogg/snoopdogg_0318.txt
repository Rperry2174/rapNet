All money ain’t good money<br/>
But ain’t no money like the show money<br/>
<br/>
We came from the bottom to the top floor<br/>
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though<br/>
Money problems everybody got those<br/>
But now a days we don’t got those<br/>
Birkin bag all my bitches got those<br/>
No Chanel everybody got those<br/>
Shooters on the roof know we got those<br/>
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those<br/>
<br/>
I pull up in a Full Metal Jacket<br/>
Pop shots, Top notch with the ratchet<br/>
I leave a nigga dead on the asphalt<br/>
Slap em in the face tell em take them fuckin’ pants off<br/>
T’d Up, G’d Up when we stance off<br/>
Two to the chest make a bitch nigga dance off<br/>
Goin’ with the Wizzin, Juice with the Gizzin’<br/>
Rides til’ I’m Risen, strong with the pizzen'<br/>
You don’t know, oh, I fucked your hizzoe<br/>
Timbo, the Designer, and finer fuck what it cizzost<br/>
See everything I’m rock and wear its handmade<br/>
If she with me then she got it all you understand me<br/>
<br/>
We came from the bottom to the top floor<br/>
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though<br/>
Money problems everybody got those<br/>
But now a days we don’t got those<br/>
Birkin bag all my bitches got those<br/>
No Chanel everybody got those<br/>
Shooters on the roof know we got those<br/>
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those<br/>
<br/>
The police, motherfuckin’ gang to me<br/>
And money, ain’t a motherfuckin’ thang to me<br/>
Let me break it down for you, keep a few shooters<br/>
And a damn good lawyer<br/>
Preparation for the worst, meditation with this verse<br/>
Education, Rebirth, cause you know if you last you first<br/>
And everybody wanna be the best, Red bottom shoes for your Louie bag on your neck<br/>
Baby remember before you had shoes<br/>
When yo’ life was filled with nothing but bad news<br/>
See everything I rock and wear is handmade<br/>
If she with me then she got it all you understand me<br/>
<br/>
We came from the bottom to the top floor<br/>
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though<br/>
Money problems everybody got those<br/>
But now a days we don’t got those<br/>
Birkin bag all my bitches got those<br/>
No Chanel everybody got those<br/>
Shooters on the roof know we got those<br/>
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those<br/>
<br/>
New cars got that, good weed blow that<br/>
Bag bitch yessir, OG for sure that<br/>
Used to stay with my momma on the couch<br/>
Like the Jeffersons I’m moving on up and I’m out<br/>
Penthouse with the butler who waits by the door<br/>
To ensure I’m the only motherfucker on this floor<br/>
I got game, I got fame, I got cash, I got love<br/>
I got so many hoes, I’m bout to open a club<br/>
You got me, I got you,  you got one, I got two<br/>
Stop by and have a good time its popping’ at Snoops<br/>
Got a whole lot of this and I mix it with that<br/>
Me and Timberland remember we bringin’ it back<br/>
<br/>
We came from the bottom to the top floor<br/>
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though<br/>
Money problems everybody got those<br/>
But now a days we don’t got those<br/>
Birkin bag all my bitches got those<br/>
No Chanel everybody got those<br/>
Shooters on the roof know we got those<br/>
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those
