Niggas (Niggas), Bitches (Bitches)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Mia X]</i><br/>
What chew you want to do nigga, is fine with me<br/>
Name your game, scandalous sprees, or robberies<br/>
Moving keys for your needs, from state to state<br/>
I seen my braw take down your boy from around tha way<br/>
If you fake IM gunna let you know from the top<br/>
And leave that dick in your mouth, and put them infrared dots<br/>
On your whole crew, nigga betta ask fo show<br/>
Gunna let that ass know what's goin' down like Waco<br/>
This is business, and who the fuck you think is runnin' this<br/>
Mama, and who's the first to shoot that gun in this<br/>
Mama, drama, layin' No Limit and when its intended my hands all up in it<br/>
<br/>
Now, we can do this like intelligent folk<br/>
But fuck around, I be that second ward ignorant hoe<br/>
Hard headed, with the soft behind, niggas real hittin' it<br/>
So Snoop Dogg for the keepin' it real with a strength<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Now picture, Bonnie and Clyde, We side as we slide,<br/>
Side by side, to keep this pimpin' alive<br/>
Do a lick for me, set a trick for me, get us some chips<br/>
It's all about you and me Mia, fuck that bitch<br/>
You a fall girl, go get it all girl<br/>
You in my world, IM gunna make sure you ball girl<br/>
Do it for me, do it for you, now it's our world<br/>
(Our world, It's our world, now go on and get it)<br/>
Now everyone in my click know I don't love no hoes<br/>
I don't quit bitch rush a boy to get a new set of them MOMO's<br/>
Cus I attack 'Emm, crack 'Emm and smack 'Emm<br/>
All on the same note, until that bitch is broke<br/>
Charge it to the game, man it's a cold game<br/>
But somebody gotta do it, that's real for shes'a<br/>
It ain't easy, pimpin' to me is four girls on your team<br/>
Down to scheme, aim to beam, for that cream<br/>
Cross country track, greyhound buss ride<br/>
Down to get your muthafuckin' fetti on, you hear me though<br/>
There ain't no limit to what she does<br/>
On the really, on to Philly, lemme get a ride on cus<br/>
Ghetto love, and every thug need a little<br/>
All I want is the money, motherfuck the middle<br/>
No backbone is back on to get yah<br/>
Unless you got a down ass sister to twist her, cant twist yah<br/>
Bonnie and Clyde, We side as we slide,<br/>
Side by side, to keep this pimpin' alive<br/>
Do a lick for me, set a trick for me, get us some chips<br/>
It's all about you and me Mia, fuck that bitch
