DPG, is down with us<br/>
X to the Z, is down with us<br/>
D-R-E, is down with us<br/>
My nigga Kokane, is down with us<br/>
Eastside gang is, down with us<br/>
Niggas talkin shit, I'm gettin ready to bust<br/>
I'm number one (one, one, one)<br/>
With a bullet motherfuckers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kokane]</i><br/>
I got this Henn in my cup<br/>
And this Buddah got me stuck<br/>
I'm just trying to compose myself (compose myself)<br/>
I don't know why I act this way<br/>
I just wanna be left alone<br/>
I'm just trying to enjoy myself (enjoy myself)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Aww naw (who is it?)<br/>
It's motherfuckin' Snoop Dogg<br/>
I live the fast life, where ya keep ya cash tight<br/>
In broad daylight, walkin' wit ya flashlight<br/>
Addin' up what ya brought in from last night<br/>
She mad tight with mad bite (is that right?)<br/>
Bad lil bitches on my tizeam (tizeam)<br/>
Nigga, that's the American drizeam (wha-wha-wha-what)<br/>
Pussy broke the President (yeah it did)<br/>
And pussy made a pimp rich (yeah it did)<br/>
I live like 'em both as I smoke on my dope<br/>
On my boat...thumbin' through c-notes<br/>
Now here's a toast to the coast<br/>
Cuz we doin' it the most (we doin' it the most)<br/>
Playa playa high costs<br/>
Uno, dos, I'm bout to get ghost<br/>
Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G<br/>
The shit ya doin' is so lovely<br/>
The haters hate cuz they will never be<br/>
There ain't no limit to this melody (melody)<br/>
You niggas sippin on that jealousy (jealousy)<br/>
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (want some?)<br/>
Do you wanna have a sip with me?<br/>
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (trip with me?)<br/>
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air<br/>
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player<br/>
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up<br/>
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up<br/>
Cuz we came here to have a good time<br/>
Me and my niggas in the sunshine (sunshine)<br/>
On 3 wheels with one 9 (ya know)<br/>
It's time to shine, the world is mine (the world is mine)<br/>
I never ever dropped a dime (shiiit)<br/>
Nigga might cop a dime<br/>
Never hesitate to pop a 9 (bah!)<br/>
And always come up with the proper line<br/>
Stick to the script bitch I'm hurtin shit (hurtin shit)<br/>
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin with <br/>
(what you workin with?)<br/>
Don't need no water to go with your order<br/>
And you aint got to smuggle the shit up over the border<br/>
Affordable, sportable, unbelievable, feasible, and reasonable<br/>
We leavin' 'em low<br/>
Cuz me and my loc, keep big leaves of smoke<br/>
Gallons of Hennesey and 16 liters of coke<br/>
He done drank and she done smoked<br/>
The meters are broke, we put the V to the note<br/>
I brought the weed to smoke<br/>
And Dr. Dre, he hooked the beat up, indeed it was dope<br/>
Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G<br/>
The shit ya doin' is so lovely<br/>
The haters hate cuz they can never be<br/>
There ain't no limit to this melody (melody)<br/>
You niggas sippin on that jealousy (jealousy)<br/>
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (Hennesey)<br/>
Do you wanna have a sip with me? (sip with me?)<br/>
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (trip with me?)<br/>
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air<br/>
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player<br/>
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up<br/>
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up<br/>
Cuz we came here to have a good time<br/>
Me and my niggas in the sunshine (sunshine)<br/>
On 3 wheels with one 9 (ya know)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Shaquille O'Neal, is down with us<br/>
Look half dead, is down with us<br/>
My nigga Mel-Man, is down with us<br/>
And eastside Watts, is down with us<br/>
The whole crip car, is down with us<br/>
My niggas on the four yard, I'm givin it up<br/>
We number one (one, one, one)<br/>
<i>[Gunshot]</i> With a bullet motherfuckers
