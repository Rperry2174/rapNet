<i>[Intro: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Geah, first of all<br/>
Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits<br/>
Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir<br/>
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?<br/>
Sing it sister..<br/>
Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&amp;G<br/>
Rhythm &amp; Gangsta: The Masterpiece<br/>
Such a, heavenly experience<br/>
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew<br/>
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
In the beginning as a child I was chosen<br/>
Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened<br/>
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog<br/>
Love was given to all, outside livin the ball<br/>
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message<br/>
to reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage<br/>
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap<br/>
I'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin<br/>
and dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggaz around you<br/>
Once you get on top they down you<br/>
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin<br/>
I found myself grindin on the streets quite often<br/>
With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin<br/>
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside<br/>
Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride<br/>
Niggaz throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs<br/>
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine<br/>
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up<br/>
Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin<br/>
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin<br/>
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand<br/>
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man<br/>
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with<br/>
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light<br/>
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg<br/>
Just a block and a phone call away<br/>
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist<br/>
I'm preachin just what I practice<br/>
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe<br/>
Man woman young and old<br/>
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite<br/>
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light cause I love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[singers - repeat in background of Outro w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
(I love, to give you light)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Minister]</i><br/>
And the people that is locked up, locked down<br/>
And the people that's locked dowwwwwn<br/>
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade<br/>
On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha<br/>
I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors<br/>
Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin to heaven huh<br/>
And you ain't gon' go!<br/>
So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor<br/>
and say neighbor, say NEIGH-BOR, YOU AIN'T GOIN!!<br/>
YOU AIN'T GOIN!!
