'Bout to make the night shine<br/>
Snoop<br/>
Kellz<br/>
<br/>
Platinum through the doors<br/>
<br/>
V12 rollin' nigga goin' platinum<br/>
V12 rollin' nigga goin' platinum<br/>
V12 rollin' nigga goin' platinum<br/>
V12 rollin' nigga goin' platinum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br/>
Swag like a lighter<br/>
And I keep my swag lit<br/>
Man I'm on fire<br/>
That can't tell a nigga shit<br/>
V12 rolling<br/>
Got some honeys up in it<br/>
Say your pussy golden<br/>
But I only fuck with platinum chicks<br/>
Only talk platinum shit<br/>
Only swallow platinum spit<br/>
Speak my own slang-uage<br/>
Still I am the real-iest<br/>
Surrounded by Ciroc but your boy sipping Hennessy<br/>
Loves is a hospital and I was born in V.I.P.<br/>
Sick and there's no cure<br/>
Bad case of V.I.P.<br/>
Still in the game killing you can call us M.V.P.<br/>
Whole fucking club jump in your cars and follow me<br/>
It's dude from the Chi and the D.O. double G.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We platinum<br/>
Platinum stars<br/>
Platinum<br/>
Platinum chicks<br/>
Platinum<br/>
Platinum clothes<br/>
Platinum<br/>
Platinum rich<br/>
Platinum<br/>
Platinum shots<br/>
Platinum<br/>
Platinum flights<br/>
Platinum<br/>
Platinum cribs<br/>
Platinum<br/>
Platinum lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Let a motherfucker know from the ghetto<br/>
Limping, crimping and pimping mixing 'em all<br/>
Fixing the ball drifting listen dawg<br/>
My rap is that, my Cadillac is dripping wet<br/>
You can bet, turn it up, roll it up, burn it up<br/>
Give it back to me let me show you how to move that groove that weed that do that<br/>
All in fallin' ballin' yellin' doggy do that chew that<br/>
Record sales, hoe sales, detail, retail, you fail, we sell<br/>
Ding dong get your momma ring your bell<br/>
Back in the club with my nephew Kellz<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>

Mack-mack like macking them hard, like that, quote backing them hard<br/>
Rich nigga with a platinum card in a platinum car with mink on the seat<br/>
Hoes on the street cause they all wanna make that trip to the promised land<br/>
Little mama can give it to me like I'm the man<br/>
Give it to me like I told you<br/>
Grab you, flip you, hold you, break you down<br/>
Stop depress, drop your dress, cause I'm gon' take you down<br/>
What d'you think I got drink and you won't drink right now<br/>
Two shots and now you ready for that tat-tat-toawww<br/>
And I'm gon' give you that<br/>
