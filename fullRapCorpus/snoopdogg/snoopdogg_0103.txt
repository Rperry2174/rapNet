Fa shizzle dizzle, its the big Neptizzle<br/>
with the Snoopy D-O-Double Jizzle!<br/>
...(Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
...C-walk to this (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
...Hehe, yeah, C-walk to this (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
...Ahaha, C-walk to this (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Bam, boom, watchoo gone do cuz?<br/>
Guess I'm rollin in with them baby blue chucks<br/>
And I still got my khakis creased<br/>
Im still rockin on these beats, and got a bad rep on the streets<br/>
Its the S-N-double-O-P, and, biggest dogg of 'em all<br/>
and youse a flea, and<br/>
and since I got time to drop it for you, I guess I must<br/>
and give it to you mother fuckas like bust-a-bust<br/>
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust<br/>
And cant none of yall, fuck wit us<br/>
But you can run up on the G but thats not thinkin wisely<br/>
these pullas are contagious, just like Ron Isley<br/>
(What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home)<br/>
Snoop to the D-O-Double G<br/>
Get in, where you fit in... follow me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Whos the man with that dance? (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
Who kick the khakis from his pants? (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
Keep the lo-lo in the three wheel stance (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
Still rock the gin n juice in hand (Snoop dogg! Snoop Dogg!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I do it for the G's, and I do it for the hustlaz<br/>
Here to annihilate you mark-ass bustas<br/>
fuck the police cuz all they wanna do is cuff us<br/>
The one nigga is chilly, as if his name was Usher<br/>
But I'm still ridin in macks, makin 'em G stacks<br/>
and got them corn rows to the back<br/>
I aint really tryin to be picky<br/>
but if you give me somethin, its got to be the sticky<br/>
Doin by the ounces, Lo' lo's bouncin<br/>
Ninety doin fakin with kissin on the couchin<br/>
Boo to the ouchin, more a fountain<br/>
But thats how we get anotha doggy dogg housin<br/>
This year we aint fuck wih thousands<br/>
We clean with millions and we fly as a falcon<br/>
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg Pound, with a car fulla bitches<br/>
fuckin grits like Alice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Three 14 inch rims is runnin on the side (They riding on the side?)<br/>
Yeah they runnin on the side!<br/>
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side (They riding on the side?)<br/>
Yeah they runnin on the side!<br/>
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side (They riding on the side?)<br/>
Yeah they runnin on the side!<br/>
Three 14 inch rims is running on the side (They riding on the side?)<br/>
Yeah they runnin on the side!<br/>
Take two and pass it, it will not burn you<br/>
From the Long Beach chronicles to the Wall Street Journal<br/>
They all know the G with the cut in his coupe<br/>
Ask Bill Gates (yeah I know the homie Snoop)<br/>
Yeah I'm still loaded, hangin wit my folk and<br/>
Follow Rakim cause "I Ain't No Joke"<br/>
Cause I done seen so much, enuff to have your felons touched<br/>
When the gunshots ratta, all ya boys scatta'<br/>
Check up on ya homies but they gave ya bad data<br/>
Nigga fuckin stop breathin<br/>
That is so relievin', and now ya bitches are leavin'<br/>
What I say cuz what I say is so real<br/>
Homie you don' wanna see da, steel<br/>
You dont wanna catch a body, You cant hear the party!<br/>
Now thats what you should do, now wheres my baby-boo?<br/>
<br/>
