<i>[gun shots]</i><br/>
"Black folks can't never have no fun!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
These streets beeeee walking down the avenue<br/>
(Crazy!) From Hollywood to South Central!<br/>
These streets beeeee.. crazy!<br/>
Long Beach to Comptoooon!<br/>
Always up to no good! Craaaaaaaa<br/>
(Crazy!) Crazy..<br/>
Always up to no good!<br/>
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy<br/>
(Crazy!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Have a look outside and take a stroll with me<br/>
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?<br/>
I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be<br/>
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me<br/>
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me<br/>
I'ma stay down, you see me on them corners G<br/>
At your local liquor store, getting some optimums<br/>
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'<br/>
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast<br/>
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost<br/>
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks<br/>
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats<br/>
On the real no.. the streets'll have you<br/>
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile<br/>
Yeah, see you gradually grow<br/>
and when you walking on my side I think you all need to know...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block<br/>
In the seven deuce Coupe, hopping hipping the hop<br/>
Sipping on some Henn with my nephew Infrared<br/>
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head<br/>
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run<br/>
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young<br/>
Seesaw we raw like ooohhh-la-la<br/>
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do-da-da<br/>
Yeah nigga we shaking the cops<br/>
You niggas out there just be making it hot<br/>
But don't trip if you faking a lot<br/>
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot<br/>
<i>[singing]</i> Because if you think that you gonna slip through California<br/>
without getting banged on.. brother you're wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
(Always up to no good!) I really love my dog, grew up together and all but he<br/>
(Always up to no good!) Hell yeah I love New York<br/>
that's why I married the broad but she<br/>
(Always up to no good!) We can't hang 'em up 'cause I'm a balla y'all and he<br/>
(Always up to no good!) Let me tell you about these streeeets<br/>
(Always up to no good!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ the phrase "Always up to no good!" at the beginning of each line]</i>
