<i>[Scratching by Daz Dillinger]</i><br/>
<br/>
Dogg Pound<br/>
Don Colion, whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side<br/>
Don Colion, whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side<br/>
Don Colion, whatever, whatever, Dogg Pound, East Side<br/>
<br/>
For all my homies with the eight tray wigs (ride on)<br/>
And all the playas in the '79 Coupes (ride on)<br/>
For all of my gang affiliates in tha hoppin' '68<br/>
This ones from me to you (ride on) <br/>
Well, not the Under Dogg, call me the Wonder Dogg<br/>
I keep it crackin' while I'm stackin' in this game called rappin'<br/>
Now I kick up my feet like I kick a rhyme to a beat<br/>
And everytime you see me on the streets ,I gots some heat<br/>
Hell, yeah, then pass the beat<br/>
And everybody wanna know what's up with me and Master P (ughh)<br/>
For your concern, you knew there wann't no gimmick<br/>
When I got into some gangsta shit and told you wann't No Limit<br/>
To the thangs I'm gon' do<br/>
Now it's really goin' down with the DPGC<br/>
Well, Daz did the beat, and Kurupt got the heat<br/>
And Tray Dee, he laid the hook and Supafly played the keys (woo, woo)<br/>
Ughh, it get no realer than this from the LB to the Down South<br/>
Add more killers to this entourage<br/>
South, West, oh, yes<br/>
We in charge and we'll pull your cards<br/>
No disrespect or disregards<br/>
Life in the big LB is gettin' hard (so what)<br/>
So my squad gon' mob and drop bombs<br/>
Bring me along, we causin' everybody harm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x:]</i><br/>
I make ya scream (ahhhhhh)<br/>
I make ya shout (ooooohhh)<br/>
C'mon all you partyin' people<br/>
Let me turn ya out<br/>
Cuz you know I'm all about<br/>
The hoes, money, and clout<br/>
And I rock a Long Beach City (heyyyyyy)<br/>
All the way down South<br/>
<br/>
Can you feel me?<br/>
I can dig it<br/>
Hoes- Take me to the bridge<br/>
<br/>
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)<br/>
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (what)<br/>
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg (who)<br/>
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg<br/>
<br/>
Whether in a Khaki suit or a pimped stripe<br/>
I'm a G for G and nuttin' else for life<br/>
You can bet your bottom biscuit<br/>
You get twisted if you dwellin' in my felon intuition (what up)<br/>
Tha Doggfather is a household name<br/>
&gt;From basketball to alcohol, everybody love the Dogg<br/>
I'm sure Billy King probably got a Doggystyle tape<br/>
Somewhere hidden in his briefcase<br/>
Newsweek, Rolling Stone, major magazines<br/>
Dope fiends, prom queens, we too clean<br/>
Take a look you ain't ever seen<br/>
One hip-hop rapstar drop this West Coast rap-cord<br/>
Back to the spot up top<br/>
West Hills for real, give it up to him (WC)<br/>
A who bang with diamond<br/>
Take a hit with big Lajeezy before he found some wheezy<br/>
With blue Colion playin' in the backround<br/>
On the behind line with big style<br/>
Hitting P, LIG tell him let it go<br/>
Game strong, no longer in the roll<br/>
Just a few names from the respected files<br/>
LBC styles, DPG ale <br/>
I bought a house with a lake in the back<br/>
My big holey stack just like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i>
