<i>[Mistah F.A.B.]</i><br/>
Hey look I'm only in town for a night<br/>
And when I pull up man the crowd get hyped<br/>
And everybody love me, the browns to the whites<br/>
You live like a movie but a movie my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I show up)<br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I blow up)<br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I show up)<br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I blow up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mistah F.A.B.]</i><br/>
Now go and roll up the Swisher<br/>
But don't drink all my liquor<br/>
You know it's all good my nigga<br/>
Give me one second, I'll pose for your picture<br/>
Like cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese<br/>
Now everybody just freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze<br/>
Now DJ bring the music please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Too $hort]</i><br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
It don't take much, for me to get started<br/>
Every time you see me, I'm with a bunch of girls<br/>
Straight to the table, in my own world<br/>
The ballplayers know me, movie stars too<br/>
See my homie Snoop, we doin' what we do<br/>
Don't matter where we at, Miami or Vegas<br/>
Every time you ask me, yeah I'm a player<br/>
(Beotch) Cause I'm the life of the party<br/>
I got ten bad bitches, actin' retarded<br/>
I'm tryin' to meet a few new ones<br/>
What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'<br/>
Do you drink, do you smoke?<br/>
I could tell by your purse and your shoes you ain't broke<br/>
Hang with me, the first thing you do is get stuck<br/>
Take you somewhere, later on you'll get fucked, beotch!<br/>
<br/>

I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I blow up)<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I've been trappin' all day, gettin' paper<br/>
Headed to the club in my brand new scaper<br/>
Gators on my feet, money in my pocket<br/>
I gotta do a show so you know I'm bout to rock it<br/>
See my homie $hort, layin' low-key<br/>
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy<br/>
Dogg y Dog, anything goes<br/>
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes<br/>
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day<br/>
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way<br/>
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine<br/>
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time<br/>
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick<br/>
See 'cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit<br/>
A double whammy, right before I do the Grammy's<br/>
I do a show with Puff Daddy way out in South Miami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mistah F.A.B.]</i><br/>

(Every time I show up)<br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I blow up)<br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I show up)<br/>
I'm the life of the party<br/>
(Every time I blow up)<br/>

<i>[Outro: Too $hort]</i><br/>
Count 'em man... there's about 12, 13, 14 bad bitches<br/>
It's me, two of my homies... drinkin', we smokin'<br/>
I see all the ballers in the house, what's up mayne?<br/>
They doin' it big over there too, but you know mayne<br/>
If I wasn't here, it wouldn't be the same<br/>
Cause I'm the life of the party baby<br/>
I hope you feel the same way about yourself, beotch!
