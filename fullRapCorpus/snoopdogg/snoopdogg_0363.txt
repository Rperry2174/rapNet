<i>[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Top down, music loud<br/>
Leaves fall, don't quit<br/>
Coasting through my city<br/>
Doggy do what Diddy<br/>
What you hearing, what you heard<br/>
Turning this your learning curve<br/>
You could hooka, I'm a burn<br/>
Leaves with the Chronic herb<br/>
Laid back, listen to it<br/>
Show me how you wanna do it<br/>
If I like it, I'm a do it<br/>
If I don't, then I won't<br/>
Flick some ashes on the floor<br/>
Impala, '64<br/>
White on white, paint dripping<br/>
From the hood to the dough<br/>
Got a car full of gas but no place to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Coasting through the city with my top down<br/>
Looking back at all the years I worked my heart out<br/>
I give thanks to all my friends who stuck it out to see<br/>
The wings I grew for me<br/>
And you not come and fly with me<br/>
Coasting through the city with my top down<br/>
Looking back at all the years I worked my heart out<br/>
I give thanks to all my friends who stuck it out to see<br/>
The wings I grew for me<br/>
And you not come and fly with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Starting in the bend and a Mini Van (the taps in the box)<br/>
Torn down from the struggle but (I still never stop)<br/>
I worked three jobs at time, <i>[?]</i> notes and bills due<br/>
But don't give up, it's a process you gotta through (one step, two step, three step, four)<br/>
I've been boo'd off stage<br/>
Overlooked and underpaid<br/>
But now I'm standing in the booth next to Snoop Dogg (Snoop Dogg)<br/>
I've lost homies to the game<br/>
Seen the clouds and the rain<br/>
But did I mention I'm setting next to Snoop Dogg (Snoop Dogg)<br/>
Man got it good, he said I'm a champion<br/>
Before the Duncan came down with the "and one"<br/>
God is good, he said I'm a champion<br/>
Before the Duncan came down with the "and one"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Sunset Boulevard<br/>
Give it to you real hard<br/>
Dolo on the solo<br/>
Riding around with no bodygaurd<br/>
Cadillac music<br/>
Lil' homie, we doos it<br/>
Yes sir, I'm dressed up<br/>
And I'm the freshest<br/>
Ain't no dust, we too clean to keep up<br/>
No cliques or broomsticks<br/>
Homie, we sweep up<br/>
Up close and personal<br/>
So ya'll can't peep us<br/>
Adidas sneakers<br/>
Real heat sneakers<br/>
Ear to the speaker<br/>
Let the ry get you<br/>
Stroll on or roll on or I'm a hit you<br/>
The sun going down but we still coming up<br/>
Make a run with us<br/>
Have some fun with us<br/>
Drop dead, top back, blowing in the wind<br/>
Rolling through the city with my newfound friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Snoop D, O, double G, just<br/>
October <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm the one that's <i>[?]</i><br/>
Good looking out, huh
