<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> <br/>
Yeah man, this shit here gonna be bigger than the O.J. case<br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i> <br/>
What?<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> <br/>
His dick<br/>
<i>[laughter]</i><br/>
<i>[Tray Deee]</i> <br/>
Another blast from the Long Beach section<br/>
Break gangsta shit (Wake up)<br/>
I thought these fools knew<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Tray Deee]</i><br/>
<br/>
Out on the scout I'm about my papers<br/>
cos ain't nobody doin Deee no favors<br/>
I'm tryin ta get major with minor risk<br/>
Maximisin the minimum of time is spent<br/>
on the heist, nice and easy believe me<br/>
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy<br/>
Keepin niggas in a headlock<br/>
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson<br/>
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one<br/>
They slip and I'm bookin em<br/>
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips<br/>
Chips to the neckline cos I got a Tek9<br/>
Check mine like a pimp-main ho<br/>
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low<br/>
I go up in ya like a skeleton<br/>
So S-N-double O-Please let em know the crew I'm bailin with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
East-side LBC<br/>
is what I claim but my game is DPG<br/>
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip<br/>
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch<br/>
Is money all that makes you move?<br/>
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove<br/>
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know<br/>
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh!<br/>
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up.....<br/>
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up.......<br/>
Wake up, wake up wake up.......<br/>
Get up, get up, get up......<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tray Deee]</i><br/>
<br/>
I break fools off like lepresy<br/>
If they dare, you stare when they next to me<br/>
I'ma threat to whoever sweat my style<br/>
Hard gangsta aim to represent til death<br/>
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick<br/>
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with<br/>
The bare hand man sleeper<br/>
I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the penta?<br/>
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time<br/>
so try me you're liable to lose on my line<br/>
The 44'll be what cracks ya head<br/>
cos that's exactly what I'm bout ta cap you with<br/>
I figured niggas gettin soft like jellatine<br/>
So Doggy Dogg tell em all who we're sailin wit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
East-side LBC<br/>
is what I claim but my game is DPG<br/>
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip<br/>
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch<br/>
Is money all that makes you move?<br/>
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove<br/>
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know<br/>
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh!<br/>
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up.....<br/>
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up.......<br/>
I had to wake up, wake up wake up.......<br/>
Get up, get up, get up......<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh, gonna work that motherfucker and do the percolatin<br/>
cos Snoop Dogg came back with the head raider<br/>
Al Davis's? Nah nigga Tracy Davis<br/>
The Eastside Long Beach greatest<br/>
Criminal with style and boy you love that<br/>
Sit back relax and let me drop another rap<br/>
but this one's for the sisters and not the hoes<br/>
The ones who be groovin it on the step shows<br/>
Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend<br/>
and like The Staples I make sure we do it again<br/>
But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up<br/>
and don't think a nigga sprung cos you know a nigga fuck<br/>
Love is a house and you got the key<br/>
so give it to a nigga like a D-O-double G<br/>
I'm from the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
East-side LBC<br/>
is what I claim but my game is DPG<br/>
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip<br/>
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch<br/>
Is money all that makes you move?<br/>
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove<br/>
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know<br/>
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh!<br/>
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up.....<br/>
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up.......<br/>
I had to get up, get up, get up......<br/>
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up....
