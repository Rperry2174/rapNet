I'm not down with the Republican Party<br/>
Or the Democratic Party<br/>
I represent the Gangsta Party<br/>
The Gangsta Party?<br/>
Yes, sir<br/>
<br/>
I ain't no gang bang rookie, let that thang bang fully<br/>
I'm a boss out here on the West<br/>
Killa Coast is my home, rich rollin' on my throne<br/>
With my blue bandana on my neck<br/>
<br/>
Girl, come fuck with Snoop<br/>
Sign up on my team, there's a little room left<br/>
Girl, you heard all my songs<br/>
Steady long, steady wrong, don't get yo' ass left<br/>
<br/>
Church on the move, nigger<br/>
Now go and hit the turf with the news, nigger<br/>
I got some advice for you new niggers<br/>
You wanna be in the league, well, tell 'em who sent ya<br/>
<br/>
Snoop, D-O-double G<br/>
Hoes with double D's in line to juggle these<br/>
Snoop, twistin' up the O-G<br/>
About a whole P until I O-D<br/>
<br/>
Snoop, the one they all wanna come to see<br/>
Hoes lovin' me, you niggers wanna be<br/>
Snoop, even Bloods fuck with cuz<br/>
I hit the club, they all showin' me love<br/>
They like, "Snoop Dogg"<br/>
<br/>
"Can I get yo' autograph?<br/>
What's up with that D.P.G., Doggystyle and Aftermath?"<br/>
I just laugh while I'm twistin' up another zag<br/>
Bad bitches kissin' in the tub, takin' bubble baths<br/>
<br/>
I ain't no gang bang rookie, police tryin' to book me<br/>
I'ma modern day Tookie on the set<br/>
I got the whole party poppin', see you hater niggers<br/>
Jockin' all these ice cold diamonds on my chest<br/>
<br/>
They see my whole team thuggin'<br/>
Now they mean muggin' but that don't mean nothin'<br/>
'Cause if it's a problem I pull the problem solver<br/>
Call it 38 revolver, put an end to all this drama<br/>
<br/>
I'm top dollar with the gold flea collar<br/>
Get them girls, get them dollars, get them zeroes, get them commas<br/>
Yeah, it's time to get this change, guess I'm like Obama<br/>
But I'ma stay the same on my motherfuckin' momma, I'm<br/>
<br/>
Snoop, D-O-double G<br/>
Hoes with double D's in line to juggle these<br/>
Snoop, twistin' up the O-G<br/>
About a whole P until I O-D<br/>
<br/>
Snoop, the one they all wanna come to see<br/>
Hoes lovin' me, you niggers wanna be<br/>
Snoop, even Bloods fuck with cuz<br/>
I hit the club, they all showin' me love<br/>
They like, "Snoop Dogg"<br/>
<br/>
Two of the loc'est<br/>
Long Beach, Eastside's the place to be<br/>
Skinny side, lil' head honcho<br/>
Feel the young guap game<br/>
And you already know what it is<br/>
<br/>
I ain't no gang bang rookie, y'all just tryin' to overlook me<br/>
Long Beach, Eastside when I ride, Skinny side get real low<br/>
And I tell them I got violent acts, son, I be shoppin' on the set<br/>
<br/>
Let me hop on any hoe<br/>
Let a bitch hit me up for some brain blow<br/>
If nigger's didn't know, I'm 'bout cake though<br/>
D.P.G., Young Pilot fuck with Snoop<br/>
<br/>
O.G. what a young man<br/>
15, got hated like a grown man<br/>
Weed money, that's me, who I fuck with<br/>
When I was young, my mom said I looked like<br/>
<br/>
Snoop and we ridin' in a Coupe<br/>
And the top back, Doggystyle, bangin' out, motherfuckin'<br/>
Snoop, two-one, what it do?<br/>
I got an older chick, I'ma take to her my big homey<br/>
<br/>
Snoop and I'm thinkin' crystal clear<br/>
Diamonds on my neck, shinin' like a chandelier like<br/>
Snoop, even Bloods fuck with cuz<br/>
Damn, I can't believe I'm in the club with big Snoop<br/>
Young Pilot<br/>
<br/>
Snoop, are you still basically a gangster?<br/>
That's a figure of speech but you know, I like usin' that word<br/>
Is it G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R or G-A-N-G-S-T-A?<br/>
Say it, Larry, say it like you mean it, gangsta<br/>
Say it like you mean it, Larry, gangsta
