Kill kill kill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
How many killas you got on your mother fuckin pay roll nigga?<br/>
Snoop Dogg, C-Murder, and Silkk the Shocker<br/>
No limit  (biatch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[C-Murder]</i><br/>
Nigga nigga I'ma rida<br/>
Ride with G's<br/>
And ship keys over seas by the three's<br/>
Keep an eye on my enemies<br/>
Snoop and Silkk<br/>
In da back of the Lac<br/>
With that AK<br/>
In da blue tint, with a infer-red<br/>
Mother fucker gonna die tonight<br/>
That's why I smoke weed, get high tonight<br/>
Cuz I'ma No Limit soldier<br/>
With TRU datted in blood<br/>
I went to jail for years, for movin, burnin da drugs<br/>
Murda murda, kill kill<br/>
If you put me in danger<br/>
I aint trippin noo<br/>
No limit niggaz no strangers<br/>
I'ma tank representer till im history<br/>
Making playa hatas into a mother fucking memory<br/>
So throw'em up if you a soldier<br/>
And Snoop Dogg pass tha mother fucking dolja<br/>
I know you mother fucking feel me<br/>
C-murder aint gonna die, till a bitch nigga kill me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Kill-kill-kill<br/>
Murda-murda-murda<br/>
Ain't nut'in personal tru<br/>
See it's all about respect<br/>
Kill-kill-kill<br/>
Murda-murda-murda<br/>
Im never got slippin<br/>
Keep my heat on the dash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Now, how many niggaz you know that can fuck around<br/>
And die and come back<br/>
They get hooked up with the number one rap label<br/>
And rap, like that<br/>
Shit I can't be duplicated<br/>
But I'm highly playa hated<br/>
And I been reinstated<br/>
And I thank god that I finally made it<br/>
Fated many niggas, just to get one back<br/>
Remember im that young nigga<br/>
That put gangsta rap on the map<br/>
Never craps, only five duices<br/>
Mix that moet, white star, with them orange juices<br/>
I hang out with real niggas<br/>
Like Silkk and C-Murder<br/>
TRU niggas, do niggas<br/>
Like you niggas<br/>
Ghetto ass, lower class<br/>
Never hesitate to blast<br/>
And im so serious about my hustlin<br/>
Gots to have my cash<br/>
Can you imagin if I was broke<br/>
Shit I wouldn't be bustin no raps<br/>
Id have my strap, running up in your door<br/>
Takin all your dough and your gold and your cars<br/>
Cuz big snoop Dogg, Aint no mother fucking rap star<br/>
See ima gangsta(gangsta) and you a notch(you a notch)<br/>
And you a sucka(bitch ass nigga), and I rock<br/>
Im draped in my army fatigue<br/>
Blowing on green trees<br/>
In the navigator, and keep the heat for them playa hatas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Silkk the Shocker]</i><br/>
Now look at murda, murda, murda<br/>
And this kill, kill, kill<br/>
This shits real<br/>
Stay strapped and capped, to get pealed<br/>
And mama always told me<br/>
If you aint down to ride with god<br/>
Down to die with god<br/>
You aint no mother fucking soldier<br/>
No limit datted on my back and my stomach<br/>
Cuz ima mother fucking fool<br/>
Uhhh, show me love<br/>
Cuz when I make music with thugs, I make moves<br/>
Well im coming out hard<br/>
I was coming out large<br/>
Seen this guy named van<br/>
I bring the pain<br/>
Look everybody coming out stars<br/>
See now me, C, and Snoop in da coupe<br/>
In da house thinking about loop<br/>
I told niggas<br/>
Rap shit isnt bad, I blast'em, So I ask'em, I shoot<br/>
Just a young nigga bout raising hell and makin mail<br/>
If you a trip<br/>
I told you I was making this shit on bail (that's cool)<br/>
Back up nigga, cant flame that shit like drugs<br/>
And see ima nigga, im gonna hang like a nigga<br/>
Bang that shit like it was crips and bloods<br/>
Now deal weed nigga<br/>
Strapped up in my fatigue<br/>
Cant hold me down<br/>
Don't even trip my nigga Snoop<br/>
If you a soldier now<br/>
Do what ya think bitch<br/>
For this tank bitch<br/>
I stay quick and work<br/>
And I got No Limit scattered on my fucking forehead<br/>
That's why I do so much dirt
