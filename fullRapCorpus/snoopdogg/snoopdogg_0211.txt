<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
My goodness my gracious shell toe Adidas with the fat blue laces<br/>
Hand full of aces trumped up dump trunk white wall paces<br/>
Drink til you drop motherfucker cop<br/>
Old English 800 on the block<br/>
Way before St. Ide's came to the spot<br/>
Niggas used to hang out and do the pop lock<br/>
And if we got into some shit we never pop shots<br/>
We'd squab scrap whatever it was<br/>
And live to talk about it and we get old cause<br/>
And keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bud<br/>
We do a house party what the fuck is a club<br/>
And the ese's they sold most of the drugs<br/>
La familia hell and <i>[?]</i><br/>
We get money yeah and we do low ride<br/>
Represent it and talk nope no not I<br/>
That's the code in every hood that you roam<br/>
Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome<br/>
O.G. the place that I call home<br/>
Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome<br/>
Plaque in back strap in Lac<br/>
Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap<br/>
Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back<br/>
Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bootsy Collins:]</i><br/>
Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her<br/>
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer<br/>
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town<br/>
You just had to get up for the get down<br/>
Some say we the next generation<br/>
But we lack education<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Goldie Loc:]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i> drinking mad dog 20/20<br/>
Silver satin blue Kool Aid sagging in my Dickies<br/>
I got my loccs on sailing through my neighborhood<br/>
Catch you slipping on them bricks it ain't all good<br/>
Front door kicker Glock spitter<br/>
Black and gold flag across my face when I get you<br/>
3 wheeler tipping turning up the Alpine<br/>
<i>[?]</i> while I listen to the grapevine<br/>
<i>[?]</i> blue Crips all by the front door<br/>
East side rip riding gang banging all I know<br/>
Heart break hotel hush puppy neck kicker<br/>
I grew up on that crazy one five nigga<br/>
If you locc from my block then hop something<br/>
And I ain't talking bout no peel nigga block hunting<br/>
Blue corduroys while I'm talking on my brick phone<br/>
14 years old had to bring the shit home<br/>
My uncle Sugar Bear showed me how to bag it up<br/>
Look at the block now nigga it's sewed up<br/>
I ain't playing with you old grand pubas<br/>
Peace out Rolando ran things with no <i>[?]</i><br/>
Now take a picture of this 8 ball sipper<br/>
Look down at my shoes blue strings nigga<br/>
Goldie Loc will keep this motherfucker crack-a-lackin<br/>
The only thing I wanna hear is gang bang rapping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bootsy Collins:]</i><br/>
Some say we the next generation<br/>
But we lack education<br/>
Hanging with the crew of devastation<br/>
Yeah but we one nation mama<br/>
Tally-ho and away we go<br/>
See you next week with a brand new show<br/>
When you funk around here ain't nothing consensual<br/>
You know I funk so hard you gonna need your parent's credential<br/>
Now I'm in the street cause I lost my sheep<br/>
But now I know where to find that<br/>
Now how cool is cold when you're trying to compete<br/>
Standing next to me son you better take a seat<br/>
Can't none of you cut throats funk like me<br/>
You better check with Snoop Dogg and get your pedigree<br/>
Why oh why do I think like that<br/>
If I am with the dog you must be a cat<br/>
Now tally-ho and away we go<br/>
See you next week with a brand new show<br/>
I want the bomb I want that O.G. back<br/>
There's a party going on in my head<br/>
While I think about the blood that we shed<br/>
Then party uh when the player play<br/>
There's a party going on up in here<br/>
<br/>
Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her<br/>
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer<br/>
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town<br/>
You just had to get up for the get down<br/>
Some say we the next generation<br/>
But we lack education<br/>
Hanging with the crew of devastation<br/>
Yeah but we one nation mama<br/>
Hanging with the Snoopatronics bobba
