<i>[Verse One: Kurupt]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga<br/>
See these other fools but you can't see me, nigga<br/>
Who am I? (It's Kurupt motherfucker)<br/>
Do or die (We gives a fuck motherfucker)<br/>
So slow your roll, I'm In Control like Janet<br/>
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet<br/>
Take it for granted, if ya wanna, cuz I'm gonna<br/>
grab my strap then clear the corner, beeotch!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
So all my bitches and my niggaz and my niggaz and my bitches<br/>
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air<br/>
And if you don't give a shit<br/>
Like we don't give a shit <br/>
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:  Daz, Kurupt]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now on a one, two, three who could it be<br/>
Comin with a group of gangsta shit for ninety-three<br/>
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up<br/>
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up<br/>
Now can't nobody see me here or there<br/>
wherever I bails, I put it down on the ground<br/>
Cuz ain't shit for sale in the Coupe<br/>
with the beat flossin off gold D's<br/>
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean<br/>
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap<br/>
in your ass, for gettin us all fucked up<br/>
Now check it, it's a callin for niggaz like Doggs<br/>
who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin like hogs<br/>
(Yes y'all) Walk the Doggs (yes y'all) Yiggy y'all<br/>
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball<br/>
<br/>
I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this<br/>
Now how many bitches must get dick?<br/>
Before they say, that Daz is that nigga from back in the day<br/>
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre<br/>
Cuz I grips mics, I rips mics in half<br/>
Hoes be comin to my flat so I can tap that ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:  Kurupt]</i><br/>
<br/>
You're headed my way, nigga you best to hit a U-turn quick<br/>
So what's happenin?  I'm cappin shit up like a Western flick<br/>
The kinpin of the clique, top notch<br/>
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop<br/>
The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin to serve<br/>
the best Kurupt's era, peep the terror, cuz it's a murder fest<br/>
I smoke chronic everyday, so what have we<br/>
Another motherfucker, gettin served like some cavy<br/>
Now who, drops (ruff rhymes) I got full Juice like 2Pac<br/>
(plus I'm) rollin with two Glocks<br/>
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt<br/>
Hellraisin like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin shit the fuck up<br/>
Slow your roll, like your legs was broken<br/>
Who's jokin?  Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?<br/>
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe<br/>
Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row<br/>
Mediocre motherfuckers die cuz I'm servin it<br/>
They can't fuck with or see me I'm mass murderin<br/>
<i>[Smokin indo, look out my window I suppose]</i> Yeah<br/>
<i>[Niggaz don't understand how we kicks diffrent flows]</i><br/>
(I'm raw like new footage) I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich<br/>
(Bring your whole set and get your hood lynched)<br/>
<i>[Drop to your knees like a dog in heat]</i><br/>
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techiques<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: Rage]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown<br/>
Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down<br/>
And that's 175 pounds of beed<br/>
beatin yo' ass down to the concrete<br/>
Fool, act like ya know<br/>
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so<br/>
What's a girl to do<br/>
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> <br/>
Throw your guns in the motherfuckin air, we don't care<br/>
<i>[Dogg Pound]</i> <br/>
Niggaz don't give a fuck nigga<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> <br/>
About nuthin at all, just my Doggs and clockin the grip bitch<br/>
<i>[Dogg Pound]</i> <br/>
Niggaz don't give a fuck nigga<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> <br/>
That's why I can kick it so tuff, cuz when times get ruff, my<br/>
<i>[Dogg Pound]</i> <br/>
