Everything I do is for the hood<br/>
I'll probably never leave from my hood, my hood<br/>
Get a lot of love in the hood, the hood<br/>
That's why I represent for my hood, my hood<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much money that I got<br/>
My home sweet home's right here on the block<br/>
B side counting all this gwap, this is all a nigga got<br/>
Watching for them haters and them fakers and them traders<br/>
Catch me on the other side, with all the money makers<br/>
Shout out to my home girl, hustling like it's niggas too<br/>
Shooting dice and pimping few, doing what them bitches do<br/>
Surviving, tying the knot, keep my chucks laced<br/>
East side since I trip and fall, fieets I'm stumble on a pay<br/>
See I'm hood rich with a hood bitch, you know all that hood shit<br/>
Pull up and I pull fast, bagging up on your ass quick<br/>
Worldwide, hood at your confrontation<br/>
Niggas blasting motivation, niggas flashing<br/>
Get money, yeah that's what happening<br/>
<br/>
I'm proud of the pills, purp, paper, the pussy poppin<br/>
Bitches in short skirts keeping the clock pocking<br/>
Life on the block, drop top from old schools<br/>
Fights in the club, niggas must remain loose<br/>
Everything I do is for the hood (is for the hood)<br/>
I'll probably never leave from my hood (it's for the hood)<br/>
Get a lot of love in the hood (worldwide)<br/>
That's why I represent for my hood, hood<br/>
<br/>
Hey yo, it's closing weather up rainin here<br/>
You know I'm from the hood, yeah I don't care<br/>
One in a new, new, can it be<br/>
Regardless the problems, gonna keep it g<br/>
That's a burglar life, I can adapt too<br/>
House full of niggas like trap do<br/>
Do know its' real shit, baby this ain't no add fool<br/>
Run up in that old school, run up in a new school<br/>
Smoking so we yeah roll with the tutu<br/>
Dbcg, that's my crew, tell me what the fuck would you do?<br/>
No busters, no marks, have money, have heart<br/>
We scapes in the day time, but we vicious at dark<br/>
On your mark, get set, go, start<br/>
Did to grab it in, have money, fuck friends<br/>
Help day we get it in, you see we here in the street<br/>
Can't stand for defeat, in jail nigga all leave them 6 feet deep<br/>
Shout out to og's bg's and yg's<br/>
<br/>
I'm proud of the pills, purp, paper, the pussy poppin<br/>
Bitches in short skirts keeping the clock pocking<br/>
Life on the block, drop top from old schools<br/>
Fights in the club, niggas must remain loose<br/>
Everything I do is for the hood (is for the hood)<br/>
I'll probably never leave from my hood (from the hood)<br/>
Get a lot of love in the hood (in the hood)<br/>
That's why I represent for my hood, my hood<br/>
<br/>
You know I climbed from the bottom, yeah I made it out the hood<br/>
Got them goons popping at you, just to make it understood<br/>
You can't claim cob without being up in the streets<br/>
Grow up in the trenches yea maneuver all throughout the streets<br/>
At a certain time at night, clutching on that heat<br/>
For them gangster pimps and busters ass, niggas on the street<br/>
In the hood it's only good just for them I'm upon the block<br/>
We cannot ever leave this spot, because we served in rock<br/>
I'mma go see the stripper, see who the big tipper<br/>
Fuck the vip, I'm in the front with my niggas<br/>
Make it rain on some bitches, yeah we parking lot pixie<br/>
Couple niggas I ain't trippin, that's the life that I'm living, cause I'm<br/>
<br/>
I'm proud of the pills, purp, paper, the pussy poppin<br/>
Bitches in short skirts keeping the clock pocking<br/>
Life on the block, drop top from old schools<br/>
Fights in the club, niggas must remain loose<br/>
Everything I do is for the hood (it's for the hood)<br/>
I'll probably never leave from my hood (that's right)<br/>
Get a lot of love in the hood (in the time)<br/>
That's why I represent for my hood<br/>
<br/>
Shout out to everybody from the hood<br/>
No matter what color you are<br/>
You dig?
