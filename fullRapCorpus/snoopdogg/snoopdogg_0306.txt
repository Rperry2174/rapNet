Hey, Snoop Dogg, can you pour me another glass of that Coolaid?<br/>
<br/>
On the set, my nigga, I'mma own mine<br/>
Upgrade, just like your phone game<br/>
Big Snoop Dogg, I do my own thing<br/>
And I stays in my own lane<br/>
My rap style, is dynamite<br/>
A lot of y'all niggas do sound alike<br/>
You do it how you do's it<br/>
See, you can blame it on the drugs, or you can blame it on the music<br/>
Where I come from, if you sound like another nigga<br/>
That's called bitin', yeah, you the other nigga<br/>
Let my demeanor be the meaning, got you screamin'<br/>
While you leanin', now you fiendin', while you dreamin'<br/>
To have a big car, rap star<br/>
Ten-room mansion with a lake in your backyard<br/>
So disobedient, flavor is the main ingredient<br/>
And you lack it, it's all in your jacket<br/>
<br/>
But I'm hot, and as cool as a fan<br/>
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand<br/>
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
I'm hot (he's cool), but as cool as a fan<br/>
Bitches drinkin' lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
I'm standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand<br/>
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, <i>[?]</i> I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up!<br/>
<br/>
The reason that I say that I'm the Coolaid<br/>
Look at all the flavor that I gave to the gizzame<br/>
Just add water, it don't get no hotter<br/>
You got your whole get-down from the Doggy Dogg father<br/>
Nevermind it was never mines<br/>
Inquire intellectual, clever minds<br/>
Bet a dub that this shit pop<br/>
Bitch niggas mix love with this hip-hop<br/>
Just to be on, now what the fuck are we on<br/>
LBC, we've been known to get our G on<br/>
They call me Don Corleone, that's the corner he on, P-I-M-P on<br/>
She a freak of the week, I'm teachin' niggas how to eat<br/>
Cause I'm deep in the streets<br/>
Look, don't get it fucked up loc<br/>
Cause every now and then, niggas need a line of this dope<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm hot, and as cool as a fan<br/>
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand<br/>
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
I'm hot (he's cool), but as cool as a fan<br/>
Bitches drinkin' lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
I'm standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand<br/>
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, <i>[?]</i> I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, <i>[?]</i> I'm the Coolaid Man<br/>
Now drink up!<br/>
<br/>
S-N-double-O-P, Mr. Coolaid Man<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, S-N-double-O-P, Mr. Coolaid Man, yeah, that's who he be<br/>
Drink up (hot diggity dog)<br/>

Now drink up!<br/>
Mr. Coolaid Man, he's cool
