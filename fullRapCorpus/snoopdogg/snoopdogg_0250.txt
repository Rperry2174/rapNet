<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
As I take a look down the boulevard<br/>
Fun of get to you, life is very hard<br/>
So many faces bearing the battle scars<br/>
But love I bring to the people<br/>
Coming straight from the heart<br/>
If crisis is what we see<br/>
All over the world is pure controversy<br/>
One man can't put the price pan humanity<br/>
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Everybody knows Johnny came from the roughest part of town<br/>
Survived the School of Hard Knox but still came up and made his chips<br/>
The realest life, never watch it down<br/>
Walk with a gun through the heart of town<br/>
We hearin bam bam bam, a familiar sound<br/>
To the youth down in the gully where Johnny boy done grow<br/>
He never thought that he would make it out<br/>
It's crabs in the barrel down in ST close<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
As I take a look down the boulevard<br/>
Fun of get to you, life is very hard<br/>
So many faces bearing the battle scars<br/>
But love I bring to the people<br/>
Coming straight from the heart<br/>
If crisis is what we see<br/>
All over the world is pure controversy<br/>
One man can't put the price pan humanity<br/>
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Poor Johnny Johnny got stuck for his money<br/>
Things get funny when you rump with the daddy<br/>
Later on the goons pull up in the black Caddy<br/>
Next step on the news them find another dead body<br/>
Tales for the inner city<br/>
We break it right down to the nitty glitty<br/>
Who's responsible for the crime and poverty?<br/>
What a tragedy<br/>
Wayoo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I wish that I could singlehandedly free the entire planet<br/>
Turn from crying man poverty<br/>
Love me when the love he say they near<br/>
When we burn real seize and jealousy unheard<br/>
And you take me one, you are part of this effect<br/>
Come into slavery, we would be emancipated<br/>
If they break our eggs then co-operate<br/>
Not a gyal stop me from achieving the greatest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
As I take a look down the boulevard<br/>
Fun of get to you, life is very hard<br/>
So many faces bearing the battle scars<br/>
But love I bring to the people<br/>
Coming straight from the heart<br/>
If crisis is what we see<br/>
All over the world is pure controversy<br/>
One man can't put the price pan humanity<br/>
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy
