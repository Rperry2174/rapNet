Slow down cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br/>
(Slow down baby, slow down baby)<br/>
It's wicked in these streets<br/>
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br/>
(Ohhhhhhhhh, slow down)<br/>
It's wicked in these streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop:]</i><br/>
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist<br/>
A lot of times when I'm smoking <br/>
I'm doing that just to reminisce<br/>
It's funny, on how shit be<br/>
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me<br/>
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got<br/>
And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot<br/>
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes<br/>
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors<br/>
But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc<br/>
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke<br/>
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas<br/>
Nigga we seven figure niggas<br/>
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap<br/>
And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back<br/>
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown,<br/>
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down<br/>
<br/>
Slow down (slow down now) cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br/>
(I can't take the heat, I can't take the heat)<br/>
It's wicked in these streets<br/>
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br/>
(Ohhhhhhhhhh, slow down)<br/>
It's wicked in these streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mia X:]</i><br/>
Ayyo Snoop (I used to)<br/>
I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas<br/>
Know about the hits, hang with killas<br/>
Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits<br/>
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga<br/>
Have the card parties where the stakes was high<br/>
Go shopping hit the club and then ???<br/>
Never had a day without no drama<br/>
Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama<br/>
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag<br/>
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad<br/>
I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real<br/>
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I<br/>
Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord<br/>
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard<br/>
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child<br/>
When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down<br/>
<br/>
Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br/>
(Slow down baby)<br/>
It's wicked in these streets (Slow down baby)<br/>
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br/>
(Slow down, slow down)<br/>
It's wicked in these streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mia X:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut<br/>
And started putting all this game on records for my come up<br/>
From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money<br/>
Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me<br/>
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul<br/>
Every body seemed glad, but now they ?????<br/>
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free<br/>
And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down<br/>
Snoop:<br/>
I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun<br/>
I ????? from these shoulders, I don't need no gun<br/>
But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round<br/>
The clown bound to dump, young chump<br/>
You don't wanna get caught up in my mix<br/>
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch<br/>
We don't neva eva, talk no shit<br/>
Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit<br/>
<br/>
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas<br/>
Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br/>
(I can't take the heat)<br/>
It's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)<br/>
Slow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat<br/>
Slow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets<br/>
Slow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat<br/>
(Slow down) Slow down<br/>
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas<br/>
Slow down slow down<br/>
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
