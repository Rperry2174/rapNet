<i>[cameras flashing, Snoop interviewing Bill Clinton]</i><br/>
Yo, hold on hold on hold on hold on<br/>
Stop the cameras, stop the press stop the press<br/>
Now Bill, this yo' nigga, Snoop Dogg<br/>
Now answer me this - did you fuck that bitch or what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bill Clinton]</i><br/>
That's actually, not the first time that question's been asked; but <br/>
since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would <br/>
believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual <br/>
relations I was given - ahh - I'm not going to answer it except to <br/>
refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was <br/>
inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with <br/>
her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I <br/>
did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One: KoKane]</i><br/>
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?<br/>
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..<br/>
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?<br/>
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two: Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Lies, lies, stories and alibis<br/>
Big Mac in the land of the small fries<br/>
Everyone lies and tries to get by<br/>
Some of us drink while most just get high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
You tryin to cover up the holes in your sneakers<br/>
You need to put your motherfuckin face to the speakers (ba-bom, ba-bom)<br/>
And quit tryin to run from it (holla holla at me)<br/>
and c'mere, you big dummy (dumb ass nigga)<br/>
Don't you know you can't run from the Dizzogg<br/>
I'm down with (?)za, the long arm of the lizzaw<br/>
Y'all, niggaz know what's happening you turn your back again<br/>
and I'm bound to get it crack-a-lin I'm back again<br/>
And everybody happy for me - ain't that the truth?<br/>
That's a motherfuckin lie (fuck that fool)<br/>
Black folks stick together til we die, hmm<br/>
That'll be the day..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Liar, liar, pants on fire<br/>
Smoke so much dope they call me Snoopy Pryor (well God damn!)<br/>
Which way is up I'm tryin to get higher<br/>
I won't stop puffin til I re-tire<br/>
My bitches, my niggaz, they off the wire<br/>
They love-ly, they love me, call me Sire<br/>
Movie star bitches the ones you desire<br/>
Angela Bassett, Tyra, Mariah, the flyest, the flyer<br/>
See most bitches like fuckin with a rider<br/>
Slider, to the sider, invite her<br/>
to a gangsta, party, provider <i>[laughing]</i><br/>
with a lot of meat by-products (mm)<br/>
And beat the puddy-pot and got up<br/>
She licked the dick from the top to the bottom<br/>
(woo woo woo woo) (That's a bad bitch!)<br/>
Then she grabbed me by my nuts, and said "Hmm I got 'em!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One]</i><br/>
<i>[Chorus Two]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[KoKane scats and ad libs to the music]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[KoKane]</i> <br/>
Ah what's the use of the truth <br/>
if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
