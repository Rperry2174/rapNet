Beware of the big mash, you knew he wasn't finished witcha ass<br/>
He'll stay on it til it's burnt out, looked how it turned out<br/>
Nuttin you can do, can't help you out<br/>
So fall down, Dr. Dre done fell back into the House (DPG)<br/>
with the Pound, bitches keep throwin pussy at us<br/>
We don't want it, yea bitch it don't matter<br/>
It's all about the money, if you got it, throw THAT up (throw it up)<br/>
Hmm, ride along witcha set (Eastsiiide)<br/>
And watch us, you motherfuckers can't do that yet<br/>
I skirt out, I hit a corner on ya, fuck doin halfway<br/>
I do it to the fullest, I'll probably catch bullets on my last day<br/>
I hope a prayer come through so I can eat<br/>
My shoes lookin like about a buck fifty each (but I ain't trippin)<br/>
But I'ma come up, that's on my momma<br/>
Now that's on me, cause that's a burden on my momma<br/>
And she done suffered, the shit's gettin rougher<br/>
And when the goin get tough, the tough get a strap<br/>
and low-ridin's on the map<br/>
Snoop Dogg's #1 the whole Pound's got snaps (nigga)<br/>
Yeahh, tell me, have you seen us?<br/>
<br/>
Bendin corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it<br/>
However you want it, naw however you need it, we just dippin!<br/>
Bendin corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it<br/>
However you want it, naw however you need it, we just dippin!<br/>
Bendin corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it<br/>
However you want it<br/>

<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Uhh, actin a fool, nigga done paid his dues<br/>
and got my receipt in return, so I recline the leather seats<br/>
with a trunk full of beats and, chronic filled leafs to burn<br/>
No concern as I make a left turn on the Sharpe (sup nigga?)<br/>
Off of Jefferson, feelin awfully naked at the U-turn<br/>
Shit, left my gun, that's a no-no<br/>
Fuck Ronald Parks, I'm my own po'-po'<br/>
Nigga talkin dirty after dark, startin stuff<br/>
May have to mark up a nigga FUBU logo<br/>
Lettin off like a Ruger promo<br/>
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos<br/>
You know the rule goes, where there's a hoe there's a hater<br/>
(Fuck them niggaz!) Well there's some hoes over there,<br/>
and I concentrate on the haters later (what?)<br/>
Give these bitches numbers to the pager<br/>
Invite em to the next Dre function as party favors<br/>
Who said pimpin's hard labor?<br/>
<br/>
