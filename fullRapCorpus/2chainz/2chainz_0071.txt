<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Making it work, give them the work and they're going berzerk<br/>
Licking their clit', don't fuck with them clique and your dick in the dirt<br/>
Take them to work, pick it back up and I'm going to Paris<br/>
Her pussy so good, damnit she almost get <i>[?]</i> of the work<br/>
Making it work I'm making, I'm making, I'm making it work <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skooly:]</i><br/>
Started off I was 16, trying to get it, trying to get it<br/>
Cramped up in my auntie house, momma ain't have to place to live in<br/>
Young nigga known in the city, in the city fucking all of the bitches<br/>
Then I turned 17 started sipping<br/>
Then the all motherfucking world tried to hit me<br/>
They know I'm a rich kid for life<br/>
Now a nigga too T.R.U, no lie<br/>
Now I got goo troups, with no lifes<br/>
And they'll probably shoot you for no <i>[?]</i><br/>
Niggas ain't new to this shit, niggas just T.R.U to this shit<br/>
Niggas can't do what we did, niggas ain't do what we did<br/>
Niggas can't do it like T<br/>
Niggas can't do it like me or Bankroll<br/>
Pull up on your bitch with a bang roll<br/>
And I'm flexing on all of you stank holes<br/>
Pocket full of money that you can't hold<br/>
I'm a pimp no <i>[?]</i>, and really ain't nowhere that I can't go<br/>
Momma told me: "Go to church!"<br/>
I told her, I love her and I'll make it work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bankroll Fresh:]</i><br/>
Show you how to make one zip, make another zip<br/>
Started out with an all zip whip<br/>
Turned the same zip whip served the all script<br/>
<i>[?]</i> the profit out of that zip<br/>
Put all the profit in a shoe box<br/>
Fuck around, got me a new Glock<br/>
Fuck around, got me a new spot<br/>
Working at the park man heat hot<br/>
Trap talk got me reminiscing<br/>
Over hour renting, <i>[?]</i><br/>
For a half and fifty, here goes half a grammy<br/>
Baby come and let me get the keys and sneak in<br/>
No insurance, do the speed limit<br/>
Know a young nigga try to get it<br/>
Either you're broke or getting it<br/>
Either you're broke or winning<br/>
Remember in the beginning, I ain't even have a penny<br/>
One day <i>[?]</i> again<br/>
Now I got plenty, nigga, looking like a ticket<br/>
Wars and the shit and they looking like a Bentley<br/>
Started out trapping and finessing just to get it<br/>
<i>[?]</i> hit the pack with a live sport ticket<br/>
Nigga, who is asking? Now I got the paky<br/>
Now I got a maky, counting them in the backy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
