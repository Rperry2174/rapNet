2 Chainz...<br/>
Scream, what's happenin'<br/>
You know man, these people man...<br/>
Alot of'em, alot of'em going nowhere fast man<br/>
I call dat "treadmillin'", you feel me<br/>
They at a standstill man, got'em at a standstill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tity Boi:]</i><br/>
Long nights, more white and foresight<br/>
Foreseen in a foreign with the fog lights<br/>
On a pedestal and you're frog height<br/>
Forever clever, napalm mics<br/>
Blowed up last summer off of the freestyles<br/>
Year before that, the plug was on redial<br/>
Couple years remove for the penile<br/>
State of mind: criminal enterprise<br/>
Individuals who want extra sides<br/>
And desert, so we gone need extra pies<br/>
Emphasize I pull girls like a exercise<br/>
I pull so many hoes I need extra guys<br/>
Don't stand so close, shawty respect the fie (fire)<br/>
No sweat although the temp too high<br/>
Where I'm from, we feel the rent too high<br/>
She got me fucked up, I think the bitch too high<br/>
And I'm a southside astronaut, SA, that's the acronym<br/>
Mauri's with the air bubble on the back of them<br/>
The truck so big, it go beep backing in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yep, yep, we got'em at a stand still<br/>
Like traffic, we got'em at a stand still<br/>
Young niggas from Atlanta, we're on a mission<br/>
Feel that, that's momentum shiftin'<br/>
Yep, yep, we got'em at a stand still<br/>
Like traffic, we got'em at a stand still<br/>
Young niggas from Atlanta, we're on a mission<br/>
Feel that, that's momentum shiftin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CyHi Da Prynce:]</i><br/>
Since I was a boy wearing Bugle's<br/>
Ran with the big dogs, never with the poodles<br/>
Eating noodles, being frugal, open mic at Crucial<br/>
Pussies wanna shoot you cause yo name all over Google<br/>
Plus they stuck in neutral, and I doodle when I doo doo<br/>
So I won't take no shorts, I want the whole kit n kaboodle<br/>
Martial arts flow, what I'm kickin is brutal<br/>
Fuck you busters and you suckers, you ain't shit in my pupil<br/>
Toaster in the kitchen, but I ain't fixin a stroodle<br/>
Cause I hang with street niggas that's still getin boodle<br/>
If I never knew you, you can't get a feature<br/>
Cause my words are beautiful, I'm Mona Lisa of the speaker<br/>
Me and 2 chainz backstage blowin Keisha<br/>
Witta black and yellow bitch, you can call me Wiz Khalifa<br/>
Or, shakespeare in his late years<br/>
Face fears to make the average nigga taste tears<br/>
Waist spear for my fake peers<br/>
You in park partner, I'm in eighth gear<br/>
I hear you haters hatin, I got great ears<br/>
Cause the ATL on top and we stay here, yeah
