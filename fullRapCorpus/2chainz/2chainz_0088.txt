Whole lot of money that my BFF<br/>
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt<br/>
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet<br/>
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage<br/>
Young street nigga coming from the pot<br/>
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict<br/>
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment<br/>
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it<br/>
<br/>
Done it, done it, done it man I'm runnin' up<br/>
Tity Boi 'bout to fuck the summer up<br/>
Order some new thing for the Wraith<br/>
3rd chain on to get her naked<br/>
I'ma poster child for the hustle<br/>
You a poser child for them bustas<br/>
Game up for grabs, I'ma take it<br/>
Try to stay down like the pavement<br/>
Live by the code, keep it true<br/>
Anything and everything to get a loot<br/>
Nigga think they trill but I'm triller<br/>
Nigga think they ill but I'm iller<br/>
Nigga think they big but I'm larger<br/>
Pussy you ain't nothin' but a target<br/>
Smokin' on joints, gettin' massages<br/>
Keep dodgin' me and I charge up<br/>
<br/>
Whole lot of money that my BFF<br/>
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt<br/>
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet<br/>
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage<br/>
Young street nigga coming from the pot<br/>
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict<br/>
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment<br/>
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it<br/>
<br/>
In first class they ask me what I do<br/>
Had a stove, microwave and a blender too<br/>
Pull up on your set in a 62<br/>
Pull up on your set just to send em through<br/>
Shittin' on them niggas like an animal<br/>
Fuck the bitch, had to say I'm into her<br/>
Nigga know I know I'm <i>[?]</i><br/>
Niggas I know I know I don't give any fucks<br/>
Sold my Monte Carlo, bought a Cadillac<br/>
Sold my Cadillac and went and got a Beamer<br/>
I used to put my drawers in the cleaners<br/>
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena<br/>
Spend a lil money you can't take it with ya<br/>
They said the feds out here takin' pictures<br/>
Well I'm the freshest nigga on their Instagram<br/>
Hashtag making bands, yes I am<br/>
<br/>
Whole lot of money that my BFF<br/>
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt<br/>
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet<br/>
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage<br/>
Young street nigga coming from the pot<br/>
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict<br/>
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment<br/>
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it
