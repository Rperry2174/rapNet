<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Money machine in that bank, I just made me a deposit<br/>
Fucked that bitch raw on the sink<br/>
Is it the pussy or is it the faucet?<br/>
I just left the hotel, never let ho in mi casa<br/>
All this designer shit it's like a crib in my closet<br/>
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet<br/>
Man, all this fuckin gear it's like a crib in my closet<br/>
My Nike shoebox filled with rubber bands<br/>
Man, my Nike shoebox is my ATM<br/>
Fuck it, I said it, I'm winning, downsouth MC Ren<br/>
I might buy some Timbs, or peanut butter MCM<br/>
Raised down the street from a crack house<br/>
Pull her hair weave 'til the track out<br/>
Treat the rap game like a trap game<br/>
Trying to make a yellow ho tap out<br/>
I got Dolce, I ain't even worn yet, codeine ain't even po' yet<br/>
I could spend millions of dollars, and still won't even be poor yet<br/>
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking poet, riding now, motherfucker, own that<br/>
A nigga wearing a Versace shirt, man that's a motherfucking throwback<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet<br/>
All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet<br/>
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet<br/>
Man, all designer shit, I got a crib<br/>
All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib<br/>
All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib<br/>
All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib in my closet<br/>
All designer shit, all designer shit, I got a crib in my closet, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - A$AP Rocky:]</i><br/>
Since rappin' turn to fashion I don't know what happen<br/>
All mishappens<br/>
Matching turned to swagging, he exposed the world to trappin'<br/>
Picture poles and tactics<br/>
Ho, this that click click, fittin' to blow this backwards<br/>
Money, hoes and fabrics<br/>
Strolling past like "fuck your photo caption"<br/>
If ye ain't got it then you bragging, that's automatic<br/>
I see no need for me to Tweet, these bitches know my status<br/>
I'm the shit, all designer shit, got all kinds of shit<br/>
Got Prada wrapped from '99 and shit, bet you won't find the shit<br/>
I’m on my Honor shit, that’s winter, it’s dressed like, it’s Met Ball<br/>
I’m in Vogue, this winter, the runway, no insta<br/>
Got a crib in my closet, Spanish chick in my casa<br/>
So much space in my closet, fit your crib in my closet<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I got more sneakers than niggas, over 4000 pairs<br/>
Most all white like the Rhode Island mayor<br/>
Got a crib in my closet, hustle every day, nigga<br/>
If you on the work with them people I'm unavailable, nigga<br/>
You smell like pork in Mecca, Lord be my protecter<br/>
Second row at the fight, bitch get on my level<br/>
Larry Merchant my nigga, I got Holyfield money<br/>
Finger your girl at Coachella, gotta roll in that for me<br/>
You should see me in Lennox, I shop 'til I drop<br/>
Spent so much on the watch, had a seizure and shock<br/>
Wake up and ball, watch how I walk<br/>
Money all on my mind, call 'em lucrative thoughts<br/>
<br/>
