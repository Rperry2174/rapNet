<i>[Hook – 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
First I get some money, then I pop a tag<br/>
First I get some money, then I pop them tags<br/>
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan<br/>
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 – 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Ok I done figured it out, I know what you niggas about<br/>
We slanging narcotics, you know that we got it<br/>
There’s never ever a drought<br/>
My partner just did a whole decade<br/>
I just put the beam on the AK<br/>
I jumped in the air fuck what you usin' young nigga<br/>
I’m busting, you ducking and moving<br/>
She sucking and fucking, I do it<br/>
I do it, I do it, I do it<br/>
Put that bitch right on the wood<br/>
I’m taking it back like a starter<br/>
They busting like mortar, they busting the hollow<br/>
She model, she swallow<br/>
That sperm like it’s water<br/>
Everything on Forgiatos<br/>
You knowing I’m getting it like no tomorrow<br/>
Got 50 niggas from Chicago ready to crack your taco<br/>
Whip a brick like I whip an auto<br/>
Just made a juug at McDonalds<br/>
Just bought me ten cars, no car note<br/>
Only thing I dodge is potholes, clap bitch your ass with no bravo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 – Skooly:]</i><br/>
Fifteen, suddenly I want to sing<br/>
Sixteen, fucking hoes, selling drink<br/>
I started sipping, got addicted just like nicotine<br/>
Such a fiend, not just for lean, for these fucking B’s<br/>
Although I lean, I smoke Irene like I’ve got a disease<br/>
Oh yeah I rap and sing, don’t you know I rap and sing<br/>
And in my hood and what I’ve seen<br/>
You probably wouldn’t last a week<br/>
And in my hood the good never outweigh the bad<br/>
Don’t be mad at me<br/>
Somebody call the pastor please, a young nigga killing shit<br/>
Young nigga killing shit<br/>
She want to hear me sing like Marvin<br/>
I turn the bitch gay no Marvin<br/>
And I'll probably leave a bitch starving<br/>
Cause I really do be illin' though<br/>
When I get to flowing I can’t stop going<br/>
A young nigga poppin' like I got dropped <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 – Cap 1:]</i><br/>
First I get this money, then I pop them bands<br/>
Shawty say she want to pop the pussy<br/>
I’m just blowing money like a fan<br/>
Got them gold <i>[?]</i> shoes cost a band<br/>
Got the molly and I sell it by the gram<br/>
Got some bitches that's for it, niggas steady getting naked<br/>
I done fell asleep when I was on a Xan<br/>
Imma treat her like a dog, I’m a dog<br/>
In the kitchen water whipping with the fork<br/>
In the club tryna order 100 bottles<br/>
I done came a long way from that Impala<br/>
So I’m balling like I’ve never seen tomorrow<br/>
Shawty want to hit me in the head like a boxer<br/>
Niggas ain’t real, they imposters<br/>
I’m just sitting back eating pasta<br/>
I just ordered shrimp with the lobster<br/>
Fucking up the <i>[?]</i> in the mall, popping tags<br/>
One call put them killers on your ass<br/>
Got gas, need 34 hundred for the bag<br/>
Mason Margiellas and the PIPs<br/>
When I pull out that weed I say I’m outcha league<br/>
Got them foreign vehicles that don’t take a key<br/>
Bitches on my line, I can’t get no sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
