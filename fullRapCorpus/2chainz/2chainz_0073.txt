<i>[Hook - Bankroll Fresh:]</i><br/>
Granny came I'm like what the fuck going on<br/>
Everybody on the porch, everybody selling stone<br/>
Everyboy round here working, nigga Nextel chirpin'<br/>
<i>[?]</i> in 2004 you know back then they were serving<br/>
Back then they were working<br/>
Nigga <i>[?]</i><br/>
Super charge 442 man that motherfucker hard<br/>
<i>[?]</i> bullets and all that<br/>
You can even found where we gon' stash and work hard at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bankroll Fresh:]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Serving breakdown wanna be the man who serve flakes 'round<br/>
Know I want my shit mount<br/>
Know them rubberband count it<br/>
Know your bitch on my dick<br/>
And you know I'm selling ounces<br/>
Used to ride 78th, then take the shit to Stone Mountain<br/>
Now I'm a street executive with street money<br/>
Nigga and I count it<br/>
Oh you niggas looking bad<br/>
Oh you niggas looking mad<br/>
Super charge on them motherfucker<br/>
Cam, got this bitch fast<br/>
Young nigga just left the dealer<br/>
I'm talking about paper tags<br/>
I'm talking about straight cash<br/>
Where you flickas, that's your bands<br/>
Nigga try to duck the van<br/>
Keep your eye on your man<br/>
The young nigga ridin' and wildin'<br/>
Murk your ass over Xans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bought a Maybach out of Pro Tools<br/>
Before that it was no rules<br/>
First one with Panamera, treat that bitch like a old school<br/>
First I got them burglar bars, then I got my shit together<br/>
When we was on section 8, I feel like I could pay rent forever<br/>
Started off with triple zeros then I got me some Ziplocs<br/>
We ain't had no people, open a bitch with a 6 shot<br/>
Pull up to the dealership, left and hit a 10 shot<br/>
Left that and hit the jewelry store, left there with a wrist watch<br/>
Mama still watching Matlock, got the block on padlock<br/>
Used all my Gucci boxes, ask motherfucking stash spot<br/>
What more can you ask for, 200 on the dashboard<br/>
Got a trap on fire, nigga, we was down a street from the airport<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[PeeWee Longway:]</i><br/>
100 grams in my nutsack, had to tuck it from 12<br/>
Grinding on my Nextel, youngins slanging them bells<br/>
My uncle Joe the dope tester he heat the dope his fishscale<br/>
Back in the day I was rapping, and he would ship it through mail<br/>
2004 clientele, I drank my packs on the daily<br/>
OG smelling like piss and mattress, 2 for 5 for sale<br/>
I put <i>[?]</i> on my bunion, it's the key to my step<br/>
Ferragamo 'round my waist, I put handcuffs on myself<br/>
Fuck 12 pussy nigga, they can't find out where the stash at<br/>
Hundred gas bag, in the Audi hatchback<br/>
I started grinding, ain't got no where to hide the cash at<br/>
Granny came home like what the fuck going on<br/>
<br/>
