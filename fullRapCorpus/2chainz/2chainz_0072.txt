<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Turn the whole block big now<br/>
Made some legal money, ran off on Uncle Sam<br/>
Every seven days I might smoke a quarter bag, bag, bag<br/>
Bad bitches in my picture<br/>
Take yo ho and fuck her on the low just like a whisper<br/>
Dom Perignon by the pitcher, I used to eat at Crystal’s<br/>
Nah, I’m just lying, I used to meet at Crystal’s<br/>
Duffle bag zippers, who the fuck gon’ zip that bitch up?<br/>
Me and that bitch we gon’ ride in the trunk<br/>
Cause the hood of the car is not in the front<br/>
I did it fo’ them, no, I did it fo’ me, so, they did it fo’ them<br/>
And I like when that pussy go splash, so I told ‘er let’s go fo’ a swim<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cap 1]</i><br/>
Aye, my nigga, come get yo bitch<br/>
She outside my traphouse stalkin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Young Dolph]</i><br/>
I spoil all my clientele, and my little bitch, she spoiled rotten<br/>
Just fucked a 20k on good weed and designer shoppin’<br/>
Summer time, just made it, I’m thinkin’ drop top Spider Rarri<br/>
Who there callin’ my phone? If it ain’t about money then I ain’t talkin’<br/>
Pocket full of Franklins on me, I call that shit gangsta walkin’<br/>
Aye, my nigga, come get yo bitch, she outside my traphouse stalkin’<br/>
I valet the coupe and Nieman Marcus, I went in and ate lunch<br/>
And say that we run the streets, I say we just give em what they want<br/>
Yup, give 'em that crack, make em come back<br/>
Just scraped these six figures out the road spent it on the set<br/>
Hmm, like LL, I’m in too deep with it<br/>
Little momma pussy so good, man, that I almost fell asleep in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cap 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Cap 1]</i><br/>
Aye, my nigga, come get yo bitch, she out my traphouse stalkin’<br/>
Panamera on the Forgies, I’m flossin’, 458 with the horsie<br/>
I got that packet from Cali, I can break it down<br/>
And have everything gone by the mo’ning<br/>
Have the amigo pull up with 1000 meetings<br/>
I can run through yo city like Jordan<br/>
Nigga, my cousin, my women imported<br/>
Yo, bitch on my bumper, you can get extorted<br/>
I call my plug and I tell him bring me more<br/>
Don’t worry bout me, worry bout where yo ho at<br/>
Nigga, yo bitch outside my traphouse skeetin’<br/>
Bitch outside, she stalkin’<br/>
285, just ride, smokin’ precious, you trippin’, I left that bitch walk in<br/>
I got these racks so big I can’t fold it<br/>
I got yo bitch, yo shawty got ebola<br/>
We sellin’ that coke, we no call it a come up<br/>
Makin’ em G’s, ya gotta stay 100<br/>
That precious gas pack, we smoke it and punch in<br/>
I don’t do dinners, no movie, no nothin’, no lunches, we fuckin’<br/>
And that’s the end of that discussion<br/>
<br/>
