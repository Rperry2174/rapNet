<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!<br/>
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Uh, cut the top off, call it Amber Rose<br/>
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes<br/>
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe<br/>
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole<br/>
2 Chainz talkin' on the flake's phone<br/>
Poof! Just like that the whole check gone<br/>
Former posturepedic I was slept on<br/>
So many chains on it look like my neck gone<br/>
My girl came through and brought an extra body<br/>
Now that's an after party for the after party<br/>
Two-gun game, all black Ferrari<br/>
His and her Armani, put it in her tummy<br/>
And yeah, the bread good if the head good<br/>
Before benihana's it was canned goods<br/>
Before canned goods it was similac<br/>
I'm from where they send sharks then we send 'em back<br/>
A half a million dollars worth of crack money<br/>
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy<br/>
Yeah I did it, true to my religion<br/>
Two guns on me, both with extensions<br/>
If you on the pole, play your position<br/>
I got enough dough to pay your tuition<br/>
Corduroy trues, with the skull cap<br/>
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at<br/>
And after the drugs, where the girls at<br/>
And after the guns, where the love at<br/>
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that<br/>
Nigga I'm so dope, you could catch a fuckin' contact<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Good weed, bad bitch<br/>
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt<br/>
Woah, I seen it all before<br/>
The bitch got a man, but she schemin' on the low<br/>
How it go? It go, fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas<br/>
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers<br/>
Huh? Codeine, no liquor<br/>
Man, life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger<br/>
I'm fucked, let's fuck<br/>
She said she on her period, I said, "Yuck"<br/>
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper<br/>
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I got the chopper for the correspondence<br/>
The codeine got me standin' horizontal<br/>
I had enough of the broken promises<br/>
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontas-es<br/>
And this shit is of the meat rack<br/>
Weed sack, big car, layin' with my seat back<br/>
We next, weed never left, holla, we back<br/>
All this ice on my and my niggas playing freeze tag<br/>
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign<br/>
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him<br/>
I come through with the yapper on<br/>
Turn that nigga into hot bologna<br/>
I'm the type of nigga cop a Rollie, cop a benz, cop a two<br/>
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu'<br/>
Uh, I'm from the trap where the block'll pay you<br/>
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato<br/>
I be like you could get her, he be like you could get her<br/>
I be like you could have her, he be like you could have her<br/>
He be like, it don't matter, I be like, me neither<br/>
Uh, my old school got twenty-sixes on it<br/>
And I got your girl kissin' on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!<br/>
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!<br/>
Yuck-yuck-yuck Daddy!<br/>
Two big chain, one big chopper<br/>
Two big chain, one big chopper<br/>
Two big chain, one big chopper<br/>
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch
