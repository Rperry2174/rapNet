<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
I'm like a quarterback, hand it off<br/>
Drop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball<br/>
I done seen 'em ball, I done seen 'em fall<br/>
Rest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg<br/>
You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
You the realest, ain't no gimmicks, I got illness<br/>
If this rap game is my building, I got tenants, I got tenants<br/>
I got "gettin' it" in my spirit<br/>
I'm winning to the end, and I just made me some millions<br/>
And this only the beginning<br/>
Rest in peace to all my niggas, they died while they was servin'<br/>
Rest in peace to all the soldiers that died in the service<br/>
I died in her cervix<br/>
Chicken's, no churches<br/>
Never seen a man cry 'til you seen a man die: closed curtain<br/>
Closed casket, blasted, breathe again, Braxton<br/>
Heart filled with passion, neck filled with mansions<br/>
Nonchalant and sarcastic, my bank roll gigantic<br/>
School of hard knocks<br/>
I am the man on this campus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I can't explain it, how I'm getting to the payments<br/>
Rest in peace to my nigga, God bless all his babies<br/>
And he gettin' so much money, I know this shit sound crazy<br/>
But he coulda retired and he was born in the 80's<br/>
And my hair look I'm from Haiti<br/>
Haters say I act funny<br/>
I'm on my baby, I'm about my cash money<br/>
I'm tryna get meals like I'm past hungry<br/>
Got two or three "Rest In Peace" tats on me<br/>
What's really real? Just left the dealership<br/>
Pull your girl off my car, that's that whip appeal<br/>
I'm 'bout to milk the game if a mil<br/>
Hit the girl with my two's, Benedryl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
