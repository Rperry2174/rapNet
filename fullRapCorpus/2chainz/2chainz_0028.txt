<i>[Sample: "The Old Dope Peddler" by Tom Lehrer]</i><br/>
Every evening you will find him<br/>
Around our neighborhood.<br/>
It's the old dope peddler<br/>
That we know by doing good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Started off with a OZ<br/>
End up riding fo' deep<br/>
Pull up to that club like<br/>
Mothafucka ho you don't know me<br/>
I said I pull up to that club like<br/>
Mothafucka ho you don't know me<br/>
Started off with a OZ<br/>
End up riding fo' deep<br/>

Pull up to that club like<br/>
Mothafucka ho you don't know me<br/>
I said I pull up to that club like<br/>
Mothafucka ho you don't know me<br/>
<br/>
Most of my niggas got gold teeth<br/>
Most of my bitches got tattoos<br/>
Most of my niggas think cash rules<br/>
And I mess up hair dos like it's a pair of shoes<br/>
And I need a parachute when I'm up there<br/>
I'm in the trap cuz I work there<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Sample: "The Old Dope Peddler" by Tom Lehrer]</i><br/>
When the shades of night are falling,<br/>
Comes a fellow everyone knows,<br/>
It's the old dope peddler,<br/>
Spreading joy wherever he goes<br/>
<br/>
See what these bitches looking like<br/>
Stick it in all crooked like<br/>
Louie V is my kyrptonite<br/>
Take ya bitch and I give her back<br/>
Give her this and I give her that<br/>
Fine wine and lobster tail<br/>
Candlelight and Chrisette Michele<br/>
Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell<br/>
Fix her hair then fix her nails<br/>
Even pay a few bills<br/>
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal<br/>
And my whole crew ill<br/>
Pockets on fat burger<br/>
Going so hard you'd think I mixed the Viagra with the Soda<br/>
Staying focused, this yola here<br/>
Black and white ice, polar bear<br/>
You hold her hand and I hold her hair<br/>
I pull her close and I put it there<br/>
<br/>
