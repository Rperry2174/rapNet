<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
No off days, no off days<br/>
Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping<br/>
Trapping, trapping, trapping, 7 days a week, yeah, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Put that shit to motion, this a Cosa Nostra<br/>
Hairweave killa, on a wanted poster<br/>
In the foreign car, back seat, leather sofa<br/>
I might need some help, we done bought up all the sodas<br/>
Hard to approach us, hard to stay focused, mobbing on purpose<br/>
Car cost a crib it even came with the curtains<br/>
This I know for certain, this I know from working<br/>
Got it out the dirt and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping<br/>
Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping<br/>
Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping<br/>
Trapping, 7 days a week, no off days<br/>
Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping<br/>
Trapping, 7 days a week, yeah I'm trapping<br/>
Trapping, straight up out a church and started trapping<br/>
Trapping, Pulled out the Porsche just to trap in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Once upon a time, all I do is shine<br/>
We don't fuck around, we gon gun ya down<br/>
We gon smoke a pint, only rock designer<br/>
Hit the strip club, just to watch vagina<br/>
Breaking down bags, seconds or zips<br/>
Smelling like a bag, walking into Saks Fifth<br/>
Ferragamo, Fendi, rocking buckets, nigga fuck it<br/>
Eating lobster tail, like they fucking chicken nuggets, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
