<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Foreign exchange, I walk in the rain, still won't get wet<br/>
Nigga flick up the flame twist up the game switch up the chain<br/>
Play peek-a-boo I take ya girl and her friend and do a switch-a-roo<br/>
Started with a nick and got a 62 it was memorable my plan is worth diggable<br/>
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube in middle school<br/>
I worked the trap no interviews just told shawty that I'm in to you I'm the type that make a old school a Bentley coupe turn one to ten that's what I tend to do it's an amber alert I gotta missing roof it was black and it was travelling fast I love you now I don't care about your ratchet past designer shoes matching bags let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags if I ever fall off I'll be hopping back got a bad bitch with me told her hop in back my car speak she dark meat I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth Velourz hoodie I ask em what's for goody if you are what you eat but I am not a pussy you couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's and all we really do is shoot a bunch of movies<br/>
