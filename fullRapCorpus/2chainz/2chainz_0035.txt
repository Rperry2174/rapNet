<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I told them, get on my level<br/>
Bitch, you could get on this shovel<br/>
Coke prices high, than which was if a Tony Montana<br/>
I just got me a bezel<br/>
My slippers is clean<br/>
All I wear Tru Religion<br/>
I paid a grip for them jeans<br/>
I got a lust for the cream<br/>
I need a money machine<br/>
I need a money machine<br/>
I need a money machine<br/>
I see you doing your thing, but it ain't nothing to me<br/>
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I say I'm incredible, most legible<br/>
Schedule ain't, but I can make your girl flexible, edible<br/>
Put her top and call it putting her on my pedestal<br/>
You would never know, unless you worked at the bank<br/>
Camel toe, look like steak<br/>
And your boy look like grate<br/>
2 gun bang<br/>
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane<br/>
You can tell your girl here, because a cab came<br/>
And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change<br/>
Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune<br/>
Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune<br/>
And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me<br/>
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see<br/>
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me<br/>
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see<br/>
I need a money machine<br/>
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me<br/>
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yo it's my time to shine, so I'm checking my Rollie<br/>
A bet with the Lakers, I bought a necklace off Kobe<br/>
I be fucking your girl, I was texting her only<br/>
I told her, "I'd like your legs better if they was open"<br/>
Ever since the beginning, niggas knew I was focused<br/>
Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers<br/>
I'm a fucking example of a fucking example<br/>
Hit her from the back, nigga, that's a fucking example<br/>
I came up on Luke Campbell, I'm so sick I need Campbells<br/>
If you know I'm showing up, I hope you come with your camera<br/>
Got the city on swole with my Louis bandana<br/>
My car is shitting on niggas, I should ride with a Pamper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I give you something to see when you are looking this way<br/>
If you approaching with the drama, then we approach with the K<br/>
And when you look in my eyes all you see is the pain<br/>
On medication, I can drink 200 a day<br/>
When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A<br/>
It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A<br/>
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line<br/>
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line<br/>
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30<br/>
With my ice on early, in all gold knight sterling<br/>
Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman<br/>
Take a girl, it'll start spoiling<br/>
Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I say it's my time to get it, my time to shine<br/>
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind<br/>
It's my time to get it, my time to shine<br/>
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind, bitch
