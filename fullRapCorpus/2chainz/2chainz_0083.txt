Don't matter how far the road takes you<br/>
Nothing in this world can refresh your soul like being home<br/>
But a lot of niggas done sold they souls and made the wrong decision<br/>
So they can't come back home<br/>
So they try to find another source but it ain't nothing like love from the streets<br/>
I cherish these motherfuckin streets
