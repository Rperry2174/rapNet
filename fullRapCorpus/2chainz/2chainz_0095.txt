I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you<br/>
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya<br/>
<br/>
I wear Versace like it's Nike, you don't like it do you<br/>
I bet you feel this bankroll if I bump into you, oh yeah<br/>
Chopper bullets flying errywhere, got them chopper bullets flying errywhere<br/>
.223 chopper clip as long as Stacey Augmon., in the restaurant I order 2 fried lobsters<br/>
Napkin on my Balmains, smokin' with lil mama<br/>
Like fuck your baby daddy, his daddy should've worn a condom<br/>
All these grams on me, all these bands on me<br/>
Make her want to dance on me and put her hands on me<br/>
Sprinter van on me, I got them Zans on me<br/>
Driveway so damn long by the time I leave I'm damn asleep<br/>
<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you<br/>
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya<br/>
<br/>
I done put so many on I can't fall off, trying to see how much the West End Mall costs<br/>
I might buy a Maybach and paint it all gold, buy a crib fill the rooms up with all stoves<br/>
<i>[?]</i> pocket full of money <i>[?]</i><br/>
I feel like I just paid off the plug, drop the top off the whip, hell I receive<br/>
High life nights so I woke up this evening, can't pimp me so don't you tip me<br/>
Rims on the car make it six feet, so I can park the car wherever the blimps be<br/>
I want a bird for my birthday, I drink syrup with no pancakes<br/>
Yeah, bitches round my pool, I make them hoe look like my landscape<br/>
Yeah, El Chapo J R R, multicolor A.R. rules<br/>
Looking like I play ball, tell 'em keep they day jobs<br/>
<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr<br/>
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr<br/>
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you<br/>
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya
