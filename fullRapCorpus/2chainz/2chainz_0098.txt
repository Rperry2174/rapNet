Felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
<br/>
Been havin' that happy hour<br/>
Presidential Rolex, I declare<br/>
I don’t care what they doing over there<br/>
Wrap my dreads in a ponytail<br/>
I thumb through the cash right in front of folks<br/>
AK on the yacht, that’s my banana boat<br/>
South Florida for the winter, I got sunburn<br/>
Half you niggas was some suckers in the lunchroom<br/>
I don’t care about the tats on your face<br/>
Them bitches cost 15 dollars<br/>
I don’t care about the pills that you take<br/>
Them bitches cost 15 dollars<br/>
I’m a rich nigga, I take rich drugs<br/>
Smoking gas and drinking lean in the strip club<br/>
Got too many kids to play with you niggas<br/>
I’m lost for words, nothing to say to you niggas<br/>
I got a Maybach, a Chevelle, a Drophead<br/>
A Wraith, a Audi, Infinity<br/>
Got a tour bus that’s long as a fucking centipede<br/>
Got a Panamera, a duely and a sling<br/>
Cappin’, I’m cappin’, I’m cappin’, I’m cappin’<br/>
I put it in your face like a motherfucking napkin<br/>
Got me a Sprinter just to play the fucking game in<br/>
At nighttime I turn that bitch to the Days Inn<br/>
Two crosses on and they looking like “Ay man”<br/>
They looking at me like I’m paid man<br/>
It’s nothing much that I can say man<br/>
‘Cause my actions speak louder than my fragrance<br/>
<br/>
Felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
I felt like cappin’<br/>
Felt like cappin’
