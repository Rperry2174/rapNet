<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax<br/>
Movie, Bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass<br/>
Who he's, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye<br/>
Louie V's in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid<br/>
Bread up and my top down<br/>
On the block with a block out<br/>
Hit ya ass with that block out<br/>
Dope enough to go in yo nostrils<br/>
I'll take ya girl and kid nap her<br/>
Feed her to my mattress<br/>
The skeleton in my closet<br/>
It's probably dead ass rappers<br/>
It's probably pussy ass niggas<br/>
Don't try me I pull that trigga<br/>
Got ya car note in my cup<br/>
And your rent in my swisha<br/>
That pussy so good I miss ya<br/>
Head game's so vicious<br/>
And all I get is cheese<br/>
Like I'm taking pictures<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya<br/>
If I take you out of the picture<br/>
I know real niggas won't miss ya<br/>
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I<br/>
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I<br/>
Real niggas, say word,<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Real niggas, say word,<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Real niggas, stay true<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
That's a thing I don't do<br/>
Nah I just do it for the niggas<br/>
That are trying to see a million 'fore they die<br/>
Wattup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
2 Chainz and champagne<br/>
You want true, that's true enough<br/>
Forbes list like every year<br/>
My office is my tour bus<br/>
She came through, she brought food<br/>
She got fucked, she knew wassup<br/>
She think I'm the realest out<br/>
And I say "damn, that makes two of us"<br/>
Oh that look like what's her name<br/>
Chances are there's what's her name<br/>
Chances are, if she was acting up<br/>
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again<br/>
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee<br/>
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time it's fine with me<br/>
Young as an intern, with money like I built the shit<br/>
Streets talking that confirm<br/>
Go ask them who just catch shit<br/>
Stay keeping my cup full so I'm extra charged like a state tax<br/>
Me an' Chainz go way back<br/>
We don't talk shit, we just say facts (Yes Lord)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya<br/>
If I take you out of the picture<br/>
I know real niggas won't miss ya<br/>
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I<br/>
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I<br/>
Real niggas, say word,<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Real niggas, say word,<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Real niggas, stay true<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
That's a thing I don't do<br/>
Nah I just do it for the niggas<br/>
That are trying to see a million 'fore they die<br/>
Wattup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Name a nigga that want some<br/>
I'll out rap his ass<br/>
I'll trap his ass<br/>
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass<br/>
Take 'em out, bring 'em in<br/>
Them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring<br/>
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend<br/>
I did what they say I wouldn't (go)<br/>
Went where they say I couldn't (true)<br/>
YSL belt buckle<br/>
Ya'll niggas sure is looking<br/>
Ya'll niggas sure is lucky<br/>
2 Chainz on my rugby<br/>
Left hand on that steering wheel<br/>
Right hand on that pussy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya<br/>
If I take you out of the picture<br/>
I know real niggas won't miss ya<br/>
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I<br/>
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-I-ee-I<br/>
Real niggas, say word,<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Real niggas, say word,<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Real niggas, stay true<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
Ye ain't never told no lie<br/>
That's a thing I don't do<br/>
Nah I just do it for the niggas<br/>
That are trying to see a million 'fore they die<br/>
Wattup
