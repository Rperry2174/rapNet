Beautiful... Pain<br/>
<br/>
Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do<br/>
Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you<br/>
Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do<br/>
Niggas stunt on you, front on you<br/>
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame<br/>
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead<br/>
By the time you get there<br/>
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack<br/>
Her lips and her hips thick<br/>
My boxers are covered in her lipstick<br/>
Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint<br/>
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond<br/>
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm<br/>
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada<br/>
Run this rap shit, I got stamina<br/>
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha<br/>
Fuck you and whoever came witcha<br/>
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha<br/>
Like a tattoo of a framed picture<br/>
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member<br/>
I got some gambling scriputres like um<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Scared money don't make no money<br/>
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me<br/>
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking<br/>
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lloyd:]</i><br/>
Oh I feel so fly<br/>
Came so far, but I still wanna fly<br/>
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane<br/>
See what this beautiful pain, provide<br/>
Baby look into my eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ma$e:]</i><br/>
Shamon.. hm-mmm<br/>
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent<br/>
Daddy deserted so he now serves sandwich serving<br/>
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains<br/>
What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working<br/>
But now the companies are merging<br/>
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service<br/>
I'm to young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further<br/>
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them<br/>
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning<br/>
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it<br/>
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered<br/>
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but<br/>
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up<br/>
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up<br/>
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up<br/>
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ma$e:]</i><br/>
You don't see my pain<br/>
I guess it's beautiful pain<br/>
It gotta be beautiful pain<br/>
Sometime you don't gotta say much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd:]</i><br/>
Life is a game of inches<br/>
Every move leads to something better<br/>
Theres no time to pay the bitches<br/>
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever<br/>
<br/>
I'll be the man or I rather die<br/>
<i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
