I told her bounce it back<br/>
I told her ounces back<br/>
I told her bounce it back<br/>
You been sellin' drugs for years<br/>
Ain't got a bird, nigga<br/>
You been sellin' weed, nigga<br/>
You ain't a plug, nigga<br/>
<br/>
You know I'm different from them<br/>
I'm from a different cloth<br/>
I got a nina ross<br/>
9th grade, gettin' paid<br/>
Sunshine, no shade<br/>
All day, errday<br/>
Southwest Atlanta, A<br/>
Okay<br/>
Let me start, nigga<br/>
Apartment baby, I can't deny<br/>
Transparent, see through it, I like it then I buy<br/>
Seen through you niggas like Ziplocs<br/>
Gucci be all on my flip flops<br/>
Had me more white than a avalanche<br/>
I put that gas in a turkey bag<br/>
<br/>
I told her ounces back<br/>
I told her bounce it back<br/>
I told her ounces back<br/>
I told her bounce it back<br/>
You been sellin' drugs for years<br/>
Ain't got a bird, nigga<br/>
You been sellin' weed, nigga<br/>
You ain't a plug, nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm back to my condo on Jupiter<br/>
You must have forgot I had it<br/>
You already know what I'm mad at<br/>
I'm wearin' Hermes as a habit<br/>
And I got that hat and the rabbit<br/>
So now that we got it established<br/>
Who want a gunfight?<br/>
Slung it from left right<br/>
Back on my bullshit, it ain't nothin' nice<br/>
Ain't sacrifice, went Saks twice<br/>
That's how I feel, young nigga, yoooooung<br/>
Okay, I'm back... where they at?<br/>
Yo, Skooly, my nigga<br/>
What we gon' do on these niggas?<br/>
Rockin' Medusa on niggas<br/>
Quality tru<br/>
My cousin coolin', meant to say... my bousin boolin'<br/>
Goat had them units, Goat had that cookie<br/>
I had a plug on it, I brought the kush in<br/>
See I wanna rub on it, I miss that pussy<br/>
And I'll beat that pussy, friendly reminder<br/>
Don't let me find you, I creep up behind you<br/>
I give you the Heimlich, you think it's the Heimlich<br/>
Then I'ma G5 it, just switched the climate<br/>
And this is Bvlgari, and no I'm not sorry<br/>
I'ma get married at Benihana's, have the reception at Follie's<br/>
<br/>
I told her ounces back<br/>
I told her bounce it back<br/>
I told her ounces back<br/>
I told her bounce it back<br/>
You been sellin' drugs for years<br/>
Ain't got a bird, nigga<br/>
You been sellin' weed, nigga<br/>
You ain't a plug, nigga<br/>
I told her ounces back<br/>
I told her bounce it back<br/>
I told her ounces back<br/>
I told her bounce it back<br/>
You been sellin' drugs for years<br/>
Ain't got a bird, nigga<br/>
You been sellin' weed, nigga<br/>
You ain't a plug, nigga
