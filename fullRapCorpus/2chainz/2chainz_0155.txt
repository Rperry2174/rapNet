<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I am so hot, I need a fever reducer<br/>
If you don't like me, then you do not like the truth<br/>
Jump in the coupe, I just might jump off the roof<br/>
I just might land in the bushes, I just might jump out and shoot<br/>
Might get your bitch on the poop, then I'm a get with the<br/>
This is an FN, it do not take long to shoot<br/>
I did this shit with my crew, my favorite number is two<br/>
I got two bitches with me, we been kicking, this a two<br/>
Wyling on 22s, ever since I was 22<br/>
<br/>
Shoot your ass up with a.22, they with me and fading 22<br/>
Nigga talking bout the get hoes, talking bout they got plenty hoes<br/>
Every month I can fuck 20 hoes, and it ain't even that many holes<br/>
I'm a beast<br/>
I'm a beast in the streets, I'm a beast off the leash, I'm a beast on your bitch<br/>
She drinking Sex on the Beach, just have sex on the beach<br/>
I just bought a crib in Florida, just to have sex on the beach<br/>
This here ain't nothing to me, I'm always repping the streets<br/>
I am so high, you gon' need steps when you stepping to me<br/>
Real as can be, put your hands up if you're feeling the beat<br/>
It's going down, we done finally got it right off the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hell is you saying? I am the man, jump<br/>
Hell is you saying? I am the man, jump<br/>
Hell is you saying? I am the man, jump<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Coming in here, bitches are singing like<br/>
While all you nigga's is singing light skinned<br/>
But it's too late, uh, sweet like a tooth ache<br/>
Pop at your toupee, pull out some deuce<br/>
Go to your funeral, take me a bouquet, throw it up like it's hooray<br/>
Switch up the beach, switch up the foreign<br/>
What is y'all doing, what is you pouring?<br/>
Why is he snoring?<br/>
Why is he touring, that nigga is boring<br/>
Now why is he touring? Now answer that question<br/>
Didn't get an answer, so leave me a message<br/>
<br/>
Pring... Um, it Tittie boi, leave your name at the beep Beep<br/>
Hey bro, this Skater, bro<br/>

But look, we up here in the studio, bro<br/>

Eyo, like, really pull up bro<br/>
A couple nigga's up in here, and they gon run out with the swag, bro<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Hell is you saying, bitch I'm the man, I'm the man<br/>
Bitch, I'm the man, I'm the man<br/>
Hell is you saying, bitch I'm the man, I'm the man<br/>
