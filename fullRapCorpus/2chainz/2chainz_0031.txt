<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm different, yeah I'm different <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Middle finger up to my competition<br/>
I'm different, yeah I'm different <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Pull up to the scene, but my roof gone<br/>
When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone<br/>
And I beat the pussy like a new song<br/>
2 Chainz but I got me a few on<br/>
Everything hot, skip lukewarm<br/>
Tell shawty to bust it open, Uncle Luke on<br/>
Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping<br/>
I don't feel good, but my trigger happy<br/>
But the stripper happy, but they wish had me<br/>
And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet<br/>
And me and you are cut from a different fabric<br/>
I fucked her so good it's a bad habit<br/>
Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'<br/>
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy<br/>
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi<br/>
Ass so big, I told her to look back at it<br/>
Look back at it, look back at it<br/>
Then I put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic<br/>
I am so high... attic<br/>
I am so high like an addict<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm different, yeah I'm different <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Middle finger up to my competition<br/>
I'm different, yeah I'm different <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
2 Chainz got your girl on the celly<br/>
And when I get off the celly<br/>
I made her meet at the telly<br/>
When she meet at the telly<br/>
I put it straight in her belly<br/>
When it go in her belly, it ain't sh*t you can tell me<br/>
Hair long, money long<br/>
Me and broke niggas we don't get along<br/>
Hair long, money long<br/>
Me and broke niggas we don't get along<br/>
I paid a 1, 000 dollars for my sneakers<br/>
'Ye told ya, a 100k for a feature<br/>
Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed<br/>
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head<br/>
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up<br/>
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up<br/>
Yeah it's going down, she get up<br/>
Might valet park a Brinks truck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm different, yeah I'm different <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Middle finger up to my competition<br/>
I'm different, yeah I'm different <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
