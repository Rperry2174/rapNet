<i>[Intro: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know<br/>
You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go<br/>
I got em saying, I, I, I, I, I, I<br/>
I know I've been away<br/>
But I, I, I, I, I, I<br/>
I'm in your city today and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
I know you love me<br/>
And I know you're down<br/>
Cause we always end up fucking Every time I'm in town<br/>
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)<br/>
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Baby I just landed, you gon pick me up<br/>
Heard you like to squirt, I might lick it up<br/>
Conspicuous, I speed it up<br/>
And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin<br/>
I'm known for crushing, your know for blushing<br/>
Oh what was that<br/>
You blowing kisses, I throw em back, pull into that culdesac<br/>
Back then no chauffeur, back seat like a sofa<br/>
One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy<br/>
With no makeup on, your still a pretty lady<br/>
And you're beautiful, inside and outside<br/>
I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife<br/>
You call me, I come through<br/>
You pass out, I come too<br/>
Dippin it like fondue, spinach dip, cheese stick<br/>
Appetizers, entrees, it's you in that lingerie<br/>
As far as race, youse first place, I'm only in town for one day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know<br/>
You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go<br/>
I got em saying, I, I, I, I, I, I<br/>
I know I've been away<br/>
But I, I, I, I, I, I<br/>
I'm in your city today
