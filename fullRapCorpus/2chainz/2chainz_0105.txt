<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
3 chainz, owww<br/>
Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards<br/>
And skate off after, engage in laughter ‘bout what just happened<br/>
Fingers and napkins get sent to mammies; is that too graphic?<br/>
Catch you in traffic, you sitting daffy like stealing candy<br/>
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins<br/>
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers<br/>
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’<br/>
I bend some matches, then sip some gas and went kissed a dragon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I’m really rappin’, I’m finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’<br/>
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin<br/>
What’s really happnin’ bro?<br/>
Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion<br/>
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron<br/>
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain<br/>
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones<br/>
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier<br/>
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons<br/>
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the squad is comin’<br/>
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin’, aim at ya nugget<br/>
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnus honey<br/>
Knock on the side door three times and have your money<br/>
Or get to steppin’ like Kappas stompin’, I’ll slap a junkie<br/>
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject<br/>
Lord why you took Rabbit from me, he say don’t ask me nothing<br/>
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles<br/>
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin’, I heard they stung you<br/>
It’s gon’ be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle<br/>
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don’t even mumble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I’m back to ballin’, I’m in the back full of magnums only<br/>
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy<br/>
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and Castrol oil<br/>
That’s codeine turn your guillotine to a fashion show<br/>
In 4 minutes I’ll turn this into forensics in a foreign car with a foreign broad<br/>
That’s long winded, paper long, and you taking long, you just don’t get it<br/>
Hung the phone up and Satan want a song with me<br/>
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s<br/>
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches<br/>
Get pulled over for swervin’ like “Hi, officer,”<br/>
When he ask me why I was swerving, “I’m high, officer.”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom<br/>
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner<br/>
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn<br/>
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder<br/>
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data<br/>
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle<br/>
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em<br/>
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer<br/>
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum<br/>
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nigga played it<br/>
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me<br/>
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy, then kiss the baby<br/>
Get situated, get keys off table, then leave her 80<br/>
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger<br/>
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell<br/>
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb<br/>
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail<br/>
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I’m doing this shit like whatever<br/>
When I go I’mma leave for the better<br/>
I told her you dig like a shovel<br/>
I want a Ferrari in yellow<br/>
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches<br/>
I been a playa since elementary<br/>
I got more bars than a penitentiary<br/>
I got a clip that hang several inches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself<br/>
I can make it bounce by myself
