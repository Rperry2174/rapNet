Damn right I got it, damn right I got it <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet,<br/>
Lame niggas be quiet You in the presence of a real nigga<br/>
I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet,<br/>
Lame niggas be quiet You in the real nigga's presence<br/>
<br/>
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won't save you no extras<br/>
Say she fuck with me cause a real nigga is her preference<br/>
Drinking like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexin<br/>
And if you don't know I go by tity two necklace<br/>
<br/>
Damn right I got it, damn right I'm bout it<br/>
Clique full of killers, please don't get us excited<br/>
Yea I'm smoking loud so lame niggas be quiet<br/>
If you fuck with us, we gonna start up a riot<br/>
<br/>
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I ain't stunnin dese niggas, I ain't stunnin dese bitches<br/>
2 cigar rellos, look like extension<br/>
Yeah I'm from the south side, her mouth wide<br/>
My pack loud, My gat loud I back out, And click clack pow pow<br/>
Court dates Still Trial, My rep is a reptile<br/>
Now later, alligators, I step ona work like a step child<br/>
Pimp up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down<br/>
Her hair down and I'm down<br/>
Her phone off so don't dial<br/>
Dis right here is dat no style, I don't know how I do the shit<br/>
I'm true to this<br/>
T.R.U. religion, they takin swag with no permission<br/>
All year it's Gucci season, Gs on my belt buckle<br/>
Cocaine on my left knuckle, Kill and bury what's left of you<br/>
<br/>
Damn right I got it, damn right I'm bout it<br/>
Click full of killers, please don't get us excited<br/>
Yea I'm smokin loud so lame niggas be quiet<br/>
If you fuck with us, we gonna start up a riot<br/>
<br/>
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot <i>[x4]</i>
