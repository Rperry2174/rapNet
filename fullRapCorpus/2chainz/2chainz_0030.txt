<i>[Intro: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Birthday, it's your birthday<br/>
If I die bury me inside the Louis store<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
They ask me what I do and who I do it for<br/>
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio<br/>
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe<br/>
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe<br/>
When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store<br/>
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store<br/>
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe<br/>
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty<br/>
Scrr Scrr, Wrists moving, cookin' to it<br/>
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere<br/>
Just made a jugg I got bands everywhere<br/>
You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath<br/>
Referee, with the whistle (err), hold his tech<br/>
Extendo clip, extendo roll<br/>
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon<br/>
Hair weave killer, goin' on a trapathon<br/>
See I done have more bombs than Pakistan<br/>
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb<br/>
See nigga, I'm ballin' you in will call<br/>
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store<br/>
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store<br/>
True to my religion, true everything I'm too different<br/>
So when I die, bury me next to 2 bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you doing huh?<br/>
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh?<br/>
She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh?<br/>
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T.V on<br/>
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a Minaj<br/>
'Specially if you put that BMW in the garage<br/>
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib<br/>
Weren't you at niece's graduation? Man, I hate those kids<br/>
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater<br/>
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better"<br/>
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"<br/>
How 'bout she hit the West End and get her best friend?<br/>
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her<br/>
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice<br/>
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit<br/>
We in Kanye West's benz, 'cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]</i><br/>
It's your birthday, it's your birthday<br/>
Bad bitch contest, you in first place<br/>
You in first place, you in first place<br/>
Bad bitch contest, you in first place<br/>
I show up with a check to your work place<br/>
(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)<br/>
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on<br/>
(What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on)<br/>
They ask me what I do and who I do it for<br/>
When I die, bury me inside the booty club<br/>
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl<br/>
I might switch it up and get you girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]</i><br/>
Deuce and Ye<br/>
We like Snoop and Dre<br/>
And it's your birthday, baby<br/>
You deserve a coupe today<br/>
(You in first place, you in first place)<br/>
(Bad bitch contest you in first place!)
