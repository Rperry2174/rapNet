<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
They say I run the streets<br/>
I tell 'em no wonder<br/>
The cheapest thang I got on is my belt and it's 400<br/>
Real recognize real and you don't look familiar<br/>
If my girl worked at a spa, man she still wouldn't feel ya<br/>
Cocaine flow, they done dropped me in the pot<br/>
I came out hard and I sold out the block<br/>
Tity 2 Chainz, I been killin' hairdos<br/>
So many dates on my calendar it looks tattooed<br/>
Got my mind on my moolah<br/>
My Tech 9 got a cooler<br/>
They scratching they medullah<br/>
They like how the fuck you do ya<br/>
Don't make me number 2 ya<br/>
Okay, I need some Charmin<br/>
I got swag for sale and I'm giving niggas bargains<br/>
Rappers are my target<br/>
My flow so retarded<br/>
Need a handicap sticker for my 16s when I park 'em<br/>
When she in the front I make her put in reverse<br/>
And if that pussy good then I'll put it in a verse<br/>
And I'm killing these niggas, Put 'em in the dirt<br/>
And yeah, I'm killing pussy we should do it in a hearse<br/>
I woke up this morning, said I'm a get it<br/>
Turned right over and I gave that bitch the business<br/>
Hopped out the king size<br/>
My friends are green guys<br/>
Suit on, it look like I done sold bean pies<br/>
Qui-Qui-Quiet storm<br/>
I flick my lighter on<br/>
2 blunts together like an extension cord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement)<br/>
I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement)<br/>
All my bitches bad (That's a understatement)<br/>
My car is going really fast (That's a understatement)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You need a standing ovation<br/>
If you stand in my location<br/>
Every nigga round here done been shot or on probation<br/>
It's the life we chose, guns and hoes<br/>
Guns and roses, niggas know that rock don't roll<br/>
Grab the spray, Drop the phone, Cop the O<br/>
Niggas know my flow is Mop 'N Glo<br/>
You know where I be on<br/>
I be on the styrofoam<br/>
Chicka-Chi 1, 2 like it was a microphone<br/>
Your girl's like a drive thru, I want a combo<br/>
And she's so wet I need a towel, pronto<br/>
2 Chainz, A.K.A. condo<br/>
Cause that's how much these chains cost if you don't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
