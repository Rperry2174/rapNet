<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I sip drank with my dinner, smoke some gas before breakfast<br/>
Bitches know my name and I don’t have to wear a necklace (2 Chainz)<br/>
Bought a Wraith for Winter and a vert for the Summer<br/>
'Member twelfth grade I sold some work to undercover<br/>
Mama only child we stayed in a one bedroom (tru)<br/>
Used to ride MARTA ‘cause it had more leg room<br/>
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan<br/>
First lick I made, I bought five pairs of Jordans<br/>
Make it so bad, two pair were the same<br/>
I see the old me in new cats in the game<br/>
Drop some loose change on some clothes I can't pronounce<br/>
Gun so muhfuckin' big you gotta crouch<br/>
I like pretty girls with some business about theyself<br/>
Bring your best friend, you don't need nobody else<br/>
All about that mula, Netflix, and the Moscato<br/>
In my sex drive, I ride over potholes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid<br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday<br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid<br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I just got a text message from wifey, nigga<br/>
I scroll down, the next message from Nike, nigga<br/>
I’m just doing it too big on these tiny niggas<br/>
I been lost my fuckin’ mind, I never mind these niggas<br/>
Pockets deep and I’mma get in depth like like Johnny nigga<br/>
Acting like they on the edge, I’m a step behind these niggas<br/>
Outthink, outshine these niggas<br/>
Eyes chink like Chinese niggas<br/>
Fast lane, fast life, you blink you probably miss us<br/>
You thinking 'bout your missus<br/>
I'm thinking about my missions<br/>
We think you outchea snitching, that’s why we ‘round here whispering<br/>
I think my palms are itching, I think my bomb is ticking<br/>
I keep that Maggie on me, I think I'm Homer Simpson<br/>
Money over bitches, should be a Bible scripture<br/>
Bitches, hoes, and women, I don’t know the difference<br/>
All I know is this shit, I don’t owe them bitches<br/>
I do me and love it, Lord I done overdid it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid<br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday<br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid<br/>
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
All I know is this shit, I don’t owe them bitches<br/>
I do me and love it, I done overdid it<br/>
I don’t owe them niggas, I don’t owe them niggas<br/>
I do me and love it, I done overdid it
