<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Here I go, here I go this that C5<br/>
Bitch I'm back, with that crack like panty lines<br/>
Asinine, I get blow like dandelions<br/>
Fuck more hoes than advertised<br/>
They say Tune you're dead wrong<br/>
I say wrong, had to die<br/>
Pussy nigga don't keep it real no more<br/>
Drug dealers changed but the high stay the same<br/>
Prices go up but the high stay the same<br/>
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain<br/>
Chillin' in the crib with the lock on the door<br/>
Layin' on the couch with the Glock on the floor<br/>
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach<br/>
I just cut off the lights, hope I don't shoot my hoe<br/>
I eat so much shrimp, I smoke so much hemp<br/>
The world too small it feel like 4 walls<br/>
You see I got holes punched in<br/>
My chances are cold cut thin, but I still took ‘em and nigga we made it<br/>
T roll that killer, weed up in the swisher, and make it as fat as a pig in a blanket<br/>
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin, they cry for help we get ‘em a hanky<br/>
Ain't nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin', the bitches we bangin', the cinnamon danish<br/>
The penalty's pending, shit is restraining<br/>
It is a shame but niggas is shameless<br/>
Niggas is assholes, or enemas, finna get anal<br/>
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out<br/>
But still I'm maintaining<br/>
Real gangsta shit it get dangerous<br/>
You talking money and guns, 2 languages<br/>
I throw niggas from off of the plane I'm in<br/>
Oh my god, it's raining men<br/>
Said the weatherman to the anchorman<br/>
I send hella cash to the bank I'm with<br/>
What you do it for if it ain't for this<br/>
I watch my step so much, I'm starting to feel like my ankles' wrist<br/>
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I'm in Anchorage when I think of this<br/>
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Bitch I smell like money, dope man cologne<br/>
I say bitch I smell like money, that's that dope man cologne<br/>
And if he ain't getting money, don't love him, leave his broke ass alone<br/>
I say if he ain't getting money, leave his stank ass alone<br/>
‘Cause bitch I smell like money, I smell like money<br/>
When you this rich they call it wealthy<br/>
Shit they gotta call it somethin'<br/>
Lord I done got too rich for stuntin' (damn)<br/>
But not for thuggin.'<br/>
That's right bitch I smell like money, money<br/>
You smell me coming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
2 Chainz<br/>
Totin' double barrels in a horse and carriage<br/>
Ain't scared of nothing except God and marriage<br/>
Through the concrete grew a rose petal<br/>
If trapping was a sport, I'd have a gold medal<br/>
I steal her like Jerome Bettis<br/>
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage<br/>
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus<br/>
He ain't never fly nigga, like an ostrich<br/>
They say ain't nothing for free, but please free my partnas<br/>
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces<br/>
Yea, lobster rolls for an appetizer<br/>
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer<br/>
I'm in my Rolls Royce because it's black and wiser<br/>
And don't get in the way, my nig this rapid fire<br/>
Brrr stick ‘em, I'm a victim of being a victim<br/>
Codeines, Xanax and liquor<br/>
Prescriptions and couple pistols<br/>
Got clean molly with the crystals<br/>
Middle finger to the judicials<br/>
Fork and a pot is my utensils<br/>
Had a threesome with 2 sisters<br/>
I get head and you kiss her<br/>
I don't never call and you miss her<br/>
I got every gun except a missile<br/>
I paid attention to the minister<br/>
My silhouette is sinister<br/>
Only child with trust issues<br/>
You couldn't walk a mile in my hoop shoes<br/>
Me and Tune 2 loose screws<br/>
2 parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn't even pop up<br/>
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck<br/>
Polo T and ice watch, moccasins without socks<br/>
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I say bitch I smell like money, that's that dope and cologne<br/>
And if he ain't getting money, don't love him, leave his broke ass alone<br/>
I say if he ain't getting money, leave his stank ass alone<br/>
‘Cause bitch I smell like money
