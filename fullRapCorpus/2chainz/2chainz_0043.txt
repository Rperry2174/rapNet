<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I had a dream that rap wouldn't work<br/>
I woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork<br/>
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork<br/>
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork<br/>
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold<br/>
So much money on me, it won't even fold<br/>
So much money on me, it won't even fold<br/>
So much money on me, it won't even fold<br/>
So much money on me, it won't even fold<br/>
So much money on me, it won't even fold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I got Medusa on my sneakers<br/>
My dick up like "nice to meet ya"<br/>
100K for a feature, hundred K's at my leisure<br/>
Then we aim at your people<br/>
I be higher than a eagle<br/>
When I'm sipping on that codeine<br/>
Free my nigga Segel<br/>
I am ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa<br/>
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa<br/>
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flicks in Ghosta<br/>
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota<br/>
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it<br/>
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls<br/>
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some<br/>
I'm all that and then some, my trap house is my income<br/>
And it's boomin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm ballin' like Mr. Clean<br/>
I gotta keep my kitchen clean<br/>
God bless me like I'm finna sneeze<br/>
Doctor weighed me on a triple beam<br/>
D-boy in parenthesis<br/>
All gold in my amenteties<br/>
2 Chainz, two pinky rings<br/>
My trigger finger's like a lemon squeeze (Baow!)<br/>
Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick<br/>
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked<br/>
And my vision is pyrex<br/>
I do it big like a 5X<br/>
Killed they ass with the eyepatch<br/>
I got bad bitches on my side<br/>
I done fucked around and got sidetracked<br/>
My first night, I spent five stacks<br/>
Next night I forgot to count<br/>
I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out?<br/>
I'm the fireman, I put fire out<br/>
Got a pole in my basement<br/>
Tipped your girl like maliah now<br/>
Ridin' on these motherfuckers until they blow my tires out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, wrist?"<br/>
My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, stove?"<br/>
All this jewelry on, then I'm out cold<br/>
So much money on me, it won't even fold!<br/>
<br/>
