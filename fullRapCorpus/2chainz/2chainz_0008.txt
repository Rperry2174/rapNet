<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Wake up in the morning, roll a blunt and then I count bank<br/>
Pull out the garage, hit a button then the top faint<br/>
You ain't from the "A", all you really did was migrate<br/>
Asking me if I'm great, yeah bitch I'm great<br/>
Swerving down Peachtree, yeah bitch I'm straight<br/>
Every day my birthday, yeah bitch I get cake<br/>
You better get dough, ho you know I taught you better<br/>
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a love letter<br/>
Came up off Ball and G, growed up off Bun and C<br/>
Got me a Chevy swapped feet twice the same week<br/>
Shawty say she want me, shawty know I run things<br/>
We used to wear the mask like Friday the 1-3<br/>
Then I found out I had that pimp in my bloodstream<br/>
Got me one ho and then I got me a whole team<br/>
Had a starting five with a bench on the side<br/>
So for every bitch I got, she got a bitch on the side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Pimp all day I even pimp in my sleep<br/>
When I wake up I smoke a blunt before I eat<br/>
Ho don't violate, bitch you know I taught you better<br/>
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a little letter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Bun B]</i><br/>
I got money on my mind, I got cash up on my brain<br/>
I got green up in my eyes and I ain't finna pass it mane<br/>
Never let a penny pass, never let a dollar disappear<br/>
And if you don't understand me bitch I'll make it crystal clear<br/>
Coming down the Gulfway, passing by the Scale Co<br/>
Candy on the car, nigga pop my trunk they have no<br/>
Choice but to watch the neon lights with my name lit<br/>
Pimp a ho, stack the dough, yeah I'm on that same shit<br/>
Lames sit your ass up in the stands and eat a hot dog<br/>
This is for the big bosses boy and you are not hog<br/>
Never been a eagle man, I never seen you soar<br/>
Through the sky, looking super fly cause you paid off a whore<br/>
You're not a pimp, put that on Pimp, you a fraud<br/>
Buying pussy on the side instead of tryna break the broad<br/>
We don't do that over here, matter fact we never did<br/>
So keep your distance from the circle, we ain't with that tricking shit<br/>
Bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big KRIT]</i><br/>
Your eyes wide open, scopin', ropin' hold that thoroughbred<br/>
Pussy wet like April shower, twerking power, thorough head<br/>
Get deep in the mind of a pro, take her where she never been but where she wanna go<br/>
Unless she in the comfort of a monster with a mouthpiece, then I reach her on stroll<br/>
Pimp shit get rich and quick, tell a bad bitch how I feel<br/>
Never laid back, gotta make a quota, if it ain't a high roller keep that pussy sealed<br/>
So motherfucker can you buy that? At the rhythm of a bass drum<br/>
Hit the club buy the bar like a star take that other nigga bitch like dare that nigga say something<br/>
I seen pimps and you ain't one, you're not close to me I'm everything a real nigga supposed to be<br/>
You act like you did everything you could, but she was supposed to leave<br/>
At her neck like rosaries if she ain't where she supposed to be, I put her on game<br/>
She devoted to the notion of roller coasters, and that won't change<br/>
With my trunk on bang, sun on shine, break a bitch down like a Garcia y Vega<br/>
Fill her up with the gumption to hit the ground running, and go and get me some gators<br/>
Yeah suits with the tailor, that fit the frame of a nigga all about his paper<br/>
Forever pimping, never slipping, forever recruiting these top notch hoes in the majors<br/>
<br/>
