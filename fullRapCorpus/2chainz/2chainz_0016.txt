(Yeah, uh huh, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
See, what we about to do is (tell 'em)<br/>
Exactly what they can't do, dig that<br/>
<br/>
(I got 'em)<br/>
Weezy F baby, these ho's know me<br/>
Young meal ticket watch me kick it like Shinobi<br/>
Flip it like aerobics, my flow is so heroic<br/>
My girl got a fat ass and I catch it when she throw it<br/>
I wet ya in the mornin', burn you in the evening<br/>
Dump you at night, let that duffle bag light<br/>
Like my shades hella dark, and my red flag bright<br/>
Got your bitch blowin' me, like she play bagpipe<br/>
Yeah I lay that pipe, I'm the plumber to your woman<br/>
I'm the flame on the stove in the desert in the summer<br/>
I'm a stunner so I'm gonna, stunt on you bitches<br/>
Big tow trucks sittin' on chrome engines<br/>
My account look like phone digits<br/>
Don't play in that boat because today I'm goin' fishin'<br/>
You don't get it, that's why I push that folk<br/>
Dirty to that dollar blown engine<br/>
<br/>
And I'm a young nigga with money<br/>
Now what you goin' tell a young nigga with money<br/>
(Hey you, young nigga with money<br/>
What you goin' do with all that money)<br/>
Well I'm a stunt when I want to<br/>
I'm a stunt when I have to<br/>
I'm a stunt when I need to<br/>
I'm a stunt when I see you<br/>
I'm a stunt when I see you<br/>
I'm a stunt when I see you<br/>
Everytime I see you<br/>
I'm a stunt when I see you<br/>
<br/>
(Ok, yeah)<br/>
The feet on the whip, big like Jurassic Park<br/>
The car tall to get in you need a running start<br/>
And I been gettin' doses, a runny nose<br/>
Kush my cologne you can smell it on my clothes<br/>
You know me I'm at the bar with a broad with a<br/>
Arm full of tattoo's, neck full of cars<br/>
Handful of money, what up Young money<br/>
Who the baddest bitch in the club, I'm going hunting<br/>
I'm from College Park it's the home of the Menard<br/>
If you finna like money then you are my target<br/>
Where my fuckin' boys and my duffle bags swinging<br/>
The way I reach notes man I oughta be singin'<br/>
My automo blingin' and the automo leanin'<br/>
The model ain't out yet for all the more reason<br/>
Four plus four, now we're even<br/>
Two chains doin' his things at the Four Seasons<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm a young nigga with money<br/>
What you goin' tell a young nigga with money<br/>
Hey you, young nigga with money<br/>
What you goin' do with all that money<br/>
Well I'm a stunt when I want to (yeah)<br/>
Stunt when I have to (yeah)<br/>
Stunt when I need to (yeah)<br/>
Stunt when I see you (yeah)<br/>
Stunt all on you<br/>
Stunt all on you<br/>
Everytime I see you<br/>
I'm a stunt all on you
