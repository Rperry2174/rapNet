<i>[Swae Lee:]</i><br/>
We're rolling<br/>
We're rolling<br/>
And action<br/>
<br/>
Yacht Master Rollie, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Some cameras just landed on me, we're rolling<br/>
Holy moly, damn<br/>
This bitch want me and the homies, so<br/>
Yacht Master Rollie, ayy<br/>
The cameras just landed on me, what's up (out of nowhere)<br/>
Holy moly<br/>
This bitch want me and the homies, so<br/>
<br/>
Came in this bitch<br/>
It's a shame I ain't make a fuckin' film, damn<br/>
Pills in my pocket tee<br/>
And I stay smokin' on that fuckin' kill<br/>
Know I gotta swang through<br/>
Bangin' my shit, that other shit weird<br/>
I'm the fresh prince of the city<br/>
Got dranks in the back room, chill, check this out<br/>
Got Franks in my pocket, they chillin'<br/>
Lot of faces on me so I never get lonely<br/>
Seen that mothafuckin' Porsche Carrera and got a boner<br/>
I don't fuck with freeloaders, nah<br/>
<br/>
Yacht Master Rollie<br/>
Some cameras just landed on me, out of nowhere<br/>
Holy moly, damn<br/>
This bitch want me and the homie, cool<br/>
Yacht Master Rollie, ayy<br/>
The cameras just landed on me, what's up?<br/>
Holy moly<br/>
This bitch want me and the homies, so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
She shaved off everything 'cept for the landin' strip<br/>
I'm on them 22s just like the Emmett Smith<br/>
You see me killin' shit, reapin' the benefits<br/>
You work from 9 to 5, I work from 10 to 6<br/>
Up all night hustlin'<br/>
Yellow gold like mustard<br/>
Been told 'em pass the Grey Poupon<br/>
Back when I had a cutlass<br/>
Y'all niggas just rusty<br/>
I put your bitch on a Huffy<br/>
Now we're talkin' paper, boy<br/>
Crip on a hundred acres, boy<br/>
All you do is hate with your boy<br/>
You act like a snake with your boy<br/>
You act like a fake with your boy<br/>
My pockets lookin' like they ate your boy<br/>
Damn... holy moly<br/>
I don't know if she wanna fuck me or my Rollie<br/>
Even Cartier lenses can see that you're phoney<br/>
Anybody seen your style can tell that you stole it<br/>
<br/>

Holy moly, damn<br/>
This bitch want me and the homies, so<br/>

Holy moly<br/>
This bitch want me and the homies, so
