<i>[Intro/Chorus: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
This my letter to the rap game<br/>
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane<br/>
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane<br/>
I did what I had to do when the pack came<br/>
This is my letter to the rap game<br/>
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane<br/>
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane<br/>
I did what I had to do when the pack came<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Wu-Tang Clan, they ain't nothin to fuck, wait<br/>
2 Chainz ain't nothing to fuck with<br/>
Need search warrants cause these niggaz is suspects<br/>
All I talk is money so Chainz is the subject<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Came in this motherfucker hundred grand strong<br/>
To be exact, grinding the kush pact<br/>
Ride with the roof back, live with a suit act<br/>
Killing em, so I am dying my suit black<br/>
Dear rap game, you are ill homie<br/>
Havin me thinking we were gon' make some real money<br/>
Came from the streets, I'm a beast, capiche?<br/>
Lock my dick in the mail by the bills held<br/>
And hey rap game, the real comin'<br/>
The way I'm murking these niggaz hope your will comin'<br/>
And when you're numb, it's kind of hard to feel somethin'<br/>
I'm the type to get rich and still hustle, yeah<br/>
And before I leave let me say this, play this<br/>
Have my niggaz dead or in jail like Asic<br/>
Face it, back to the basics<br/>
2 Chainz on them bitches, looking like Vegas, the greatest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dolla Boy]</i><br/>
My worlds coming to an end, speaking philosophical<br/>
Six's on the coupe, when they said it was impossible<br/>
Got the type of guns to make the city feel uncomfortable<br/>
And we breaking bricks down, till the last molecule<br/>
Cherish the horizon, sun blessed party, hey<br/>
Thinking 'bout this business, and it's time that I gave away<br/>
Trying to make a plan today, niggaz on there way<br/>
Locked in confinement, gotta learn to levitate<br/>
And on the inside, my instinct, I survive<br/>
All I got left is pride, touchdown, I'mma ride<br/>
I was raised as a boss<br/>
Damn, I let a nigga take me off<br/>
And let him tell Josh that his pops was soft<br/>
Mothafucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raekwon]</i><br/>
Rocking blood diamonds, cooling in the hood with the goons<br/>
Came on this, Cam is trying to buy us some Guccis<br/>
It's a movie made, regardless, my crooks is the hardest<br/>
Buying crazy pots and pans, stay in apartments<br/>
Bank roll was all we ever needed<br/>
While niggaz was weeded, playing space, and pumping crack in the ceiling<br/>
Just fly young with heart, I sift in the park<br/>
Made sales, blazed a few shells, yeah who cares who you are<br/>
I'm honest, I make you cry like onions<br/>
Stay in your lane, beat the name and we done<br/>
I was legend yet, now my papar stretching, yeah, that's it<br/>
Go ask the Rocky Glass, "I class act?"<br/>
Villas, moving-making guerrillas, the willas<br/>
The guest-star gun fights, squeeze on the squealers<br/>
Don't come near me, nigga<br/>
If you don't got no money, fear me<br/>
Matter fact, move it, ya hear me?
