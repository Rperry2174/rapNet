<i>[Chorus: The Weeknd]</i><br/>
It's kind of just a love<br/>
Don't make me make you fall in love<br/>
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me<br/>
It's kind of just a love<br/>
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me<br/>
It's kind of just a love.<br/>
You're not just another bird<br/>
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
They ain't never seen a nigga like me uh<br/>
She ain't never seen a nigga like me uh<br/>
Chance of that is unlikely<br/>
2 Chainz in my white tee<br/>
I wipe her down and I pipe her down<br/>
I give my girl money to go out of town<br/>
You give your girl money to go to Niketown<br/>
And I one-night her, you must like her<br/>
Kill niggas with one-liners, all I need is one lighter<br/>
Counting so much money, I got arthritis<br/>
So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em<br/>
If she gets this business then I (make her fall in love)<br/>
With a nigga like me I'm killing this beat<br/>
Skeet skeet skeet skeet, skeet on my sheets<br/>
On top, from the back, I thundercat like (HOE!)<br/>
My girl got a big purse with a purse in it<br/>
And her pussy so clean I can go to church in it!<br/>
Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E<br/>
How ya like me now, it's cool but she want more D<br/>
Moet by the fireplace, this is how desire taste<br/>
And I'm 'bout to buy a case (leggo)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Tell 'em... yeah<br/>
Album coming this summer<br/>
Def Jam... TRUUUU!
