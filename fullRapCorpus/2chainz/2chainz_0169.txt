<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
It's Young Khalifa man<br/>
2 Chainz!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Money's the motivation,<br/>
Money's the conversation,<br/>
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so<br/>
We on paycation, I did it for the fam<br/>
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am<br/>
Yeah, it's the life I chose<br/>
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed<br/>
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove<br/>
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eye closed<br/>
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking<br/>
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it<br/>
You use plastic, we 'bout cash,<br/>
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2 Chainz &amp; Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I never fear death or dying<br/>
I only fear never trying<br/>
I am whatever I am,<br/>
Only God can judge me, now<br/>
One shot, everything rides on tonight<br/>
Even if I've got three strikes, I'mma go for it,<br/>
This moment, we own it<br/>
A I'm not to be played with<br/>
Because it can get dangerous<br/>
See these people I ride with<br/>
This moment, we own it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
And the same ones that I ride with, be the same ones that I die with<br/>
Put it all out on the line with, if you looking for me you can find Wiz<br/>
In the new car or in the crowd with<br/>
My new broad, that's a fine chick<br/>
And the wonder squad, I'm down with<br/>
(ain't no way around it)<br/>
What you say? Tell me what you say<br/>
Working hard, repping for my dogs, do this everyday,<br/>
Taking off, looking out for all, making sure we ball,<br/>
Like the mob all you do is call<br/>
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2 Chainz &amp; Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I never feared death or dying<br/>
I only fear never trying<br/>
I am whatever I am,<br/>
Only God can judge me, now<br/>
One shot, everything rides on tonight<br/>
Even if I've got three strikes, I'mma go for it,<br/>
This moment, we own it<br/>
A I'm not to be played with<br/>
(I ride or die for mine)<br/>
Because it can get dangerous<br/>
See these people I ride with<br/>
(I ride or die for love)<br/>
This moment, we own it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
This the biggest day of my life<br/>
We got big guns, been graduated from knives<br/>
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride<br/>
Got the spirit, I'm feeling like a killer inside<br/>
uh, financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet<br/>
Riding with the plugs so I'm close to the outlet<br/>
At the red light, rims sitting off set<br/>
I look better on your girl (than her outfit)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up, never ran<br/>
We the fam and loyalty never change up<br/>
Been down since day one, look at where we came from<br/>
Jumping out on anybody who try to say something one thing about it<br/>
Got a problem, I got the same one<br/>
Money rose, we fold<br/>
Plenty clubs we closed,<br/>
Follow the same code<br/>
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2 Chainz &amp; Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
One shot, everything rides on tonight<br/>
Even if I've got three strikes, I'mma go for it,<br/>
This moment, we own it<br/>
A I'm not to be played with<br/>
(I ride or die for mine)<br/>
Because it can get dangerous<br/>
See these people I ride with<br/>
(I ride or die for love)<br/>
This moment, we own it<br/>
<br/>
This moment, we own it<br/>
I ride or die for mine<br/>
I'm ride or die material<br/>
One life to live so here we go<br/>
This moment, we own it
