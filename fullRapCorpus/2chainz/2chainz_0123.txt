<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
About to roll some more of this shit too<br/>
I got the boy Lucci with me<br/>
We might come in there and take, all the hoes<br/>
Like I could rob, like, everybody there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
That Chanel shit, I like that<br/>
Got your own ride, I like that<br/>
Got your mind right, I like that<br/>
In a fantasy world, I'd wife that<br/>
At the blue flame with 2 chains on<br/>
8 rings on, maintain home<br/>
Got pulled over on the way home<br/>
Used to make juugs off the payphone<br/>
Left mama's crib with a thousand Nikes<br/>
Niggas know I had a thousand wifeys<br/>
Hood nigga, had a thousand vices<br/>
Hit Benihanas for a thousand rices<br/>
Garlic butter with the yum yum<br/>
You know the south side where I come from<br/>
Hit the dealership with a lump sum<br/>
Make her pump the gas with her pumps on<br/>
With some pom poms, that's Don Juan<br/>
Don Julio, trap house needs cuticles<br/>
Trap house need a studio<br/>
Trap house need a new sofa<br/>
These young niggas keep fuckin' on it<br/>
I do this shit so big I can get Puffy on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[YFN Lucci:]</i><br/>
I can tell you in love with her<br/>
Tell you in love with her<br/>
Yeah you can tell I'm just fuckin' her<br/>
Don't you tell that I'm fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah you can tell you be cuffin' her<br/>
Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah you be cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[YFN Lucci:]</i><br/>
Meanwhile I was gettin' head with my chain on<br/>
Drophead, yeah the brain gone<br/>
Plain Jane on, gettin' rained on<br/>
No time to complain, homes<br/>
Know I'm tired, took a plane home<br/>
Know my cars and everything on<br/>
Know that I murder everything I'm on<br/>
I ain't even gotta say I'm on<br/>
Yeah I smoke good, paper long<br/>
Paper good, wish you would twist the wood<br/>
Grip the wood, grip it good<br/>
Go and juug, get the good, split the goods<br/>
Get the guns, split the guns, flip the guns<br/>
Yeah, yeah, uh<br/>
We gon' take a nigga's bitch<br/>
Take a nigga's bitch, make a nigga sick<br/>
Fucked her like my bitch<br/>
I'ma fuck her like my bitch<br/>
Make a nigga sick<br/>
Take a nigga's bitch, fuck her like my bitch<br/>
I can tell you in love with that bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[YFN Lucci:]</i><br/>
I can tell you in love with her<br/>
Tell you in love with her<br/>
Yeah you can tell I'm just fuckin' her<br/>
Don't you tell that I'm fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah you can tell you be cuffin' her<br/>
Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah you be cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Downstairs at the Fontainebleau<br/>
Pour a deuce in a Mountain Dew<br/>
Did everything that I had to do<br/>
Used to blaze like Moreland Avenue<br/>
If you tryna sell me that pussy then you a prostitute, cool!<br/>
I'm a back massage and a good head connoisseur, truuuu!<br/>
I'm speedin' down left lanes<br/>
Goyard belt gang<br/>
Then important text came<br/>
She wanna play them sex games<br/>
I'm up from debt and I'm undefeated<br/>
She undeniable underneath me<br/>
She told me that I can take the pussy<br/>
Just take it easy<br/>
Celine bag when she came to see me<br/>
Had sex with my watch on, knock her rocks off<br/>
Ride around with the top off<br/>
Like hot sauce, drop off<br/>
Cartier wristwear, it don't come off, yeah<br/>
I still got her suckin' dick while she cottonmouth, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[YFN Lucci:]</i><br/>
I can tell you in love with her<br/>
Tell you in love with her<br/>
Yeah you can tell I'm just fuckin' her<br/>
Don't you tell that I'm fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah you can tell you be cuffin' her<br/>
Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah you be cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her<br/>
Yeah
