Realest nigga in it, already know<br/>
Got trapper of the year 4 times in a row<br/>
Realest nigga in it, already know<br/>
Got trapper of the year 4 times in a row<br/>
<br/>
Rap shit check, foreign shit check<br/>
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check<br/>
I ain't talkin' Nike when I'm talkin' 'bout a check<br/>
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me 'bout a check<br/>
Trap shit check, foreign shit check<br/>
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check<br/>
I ain't talkin' Nike when I'm talkin' 'bout a check<br/>
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me 'bout a check<br/>
<br/>
Rap shit check, trap shit check<br/>
Cashier check, fashion check<br/>
Foreign car check, foreign bitch check<br/>
Rolex check, gold around my neck<br/>
Juju on the diamond, my umbrella's designer<br/>
Stand on your recliner, pourin' all the wine up<br/>
Yea I used to pitch, you should see my wind up<br/>
Nigga fuck with me ain't no telling where you wind up<br/>
It's all love, positive vibes<br/>
Walking through the airport in crocodile slides<br/>
Wet floor signs, hands on thighs<br/>
If you got a check put your hands up high<br/>
<br/>
Rap shit check, foreign shit check<br/>
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check<br/>
I ain't talkin' Nike when I'm talkin' 'bout a check<br/>
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me 'bout a check<br/>
Rap shit check, foreign shit check<br/>
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check<br/>
I ain't talkin' Nike when I'm talkin' 'bout a check<br/>
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me 'bout a check<br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on, come on<br/>
I rock the microphone, I had to thank the Lord<br/>
I am in rare form, I had to get it on<br/>
You never feed me, I use my own seasoning<br/>
Autograph cleavage, how many girls believe you?<br/>
How many girls you tried, I know a girl you lied to<br/>
She wants your ass to die, I look you dead in your eye<br/>
It's real nigga season, it's right after Easter<br/>
Might buy me a Regal, put that on my Visa<br/>
I need me some singles, don't care if you're single<br/>
Take you and mingle, take you to Neiman's<br/>
We hit the bars tonight, look at the roof on the Wraith<br/>
It look like the stars at night, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Rap shit check, foreign shit check<br/>
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check<br/>
I ain't talkin' Nike when I'm talkin' 'bout a check<br/>
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me 'bout a check<br/>
Rap shit check, foreign shit check<br/>
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check<br/>
I ain't talkin' Nike when I'm talkin' 'bout a check<br/>
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me 'bout a check<br/>
Rap shit check, foreign shit check<br/>
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check<br/>
I ain't talkin' Nike when I'm talkin' 'bout a check<br/>
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me 'bout a check<br/>
<br/>
ASAP...
