<i>[PART 1: Dresser]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]</i><br/>
.454, I pull up on niggas, I tell 'em lets get it<br/>
Niggas they talkin' on Twitter, you niggas you know you gon get it<br/>
Benjamin Franklin, niggas know that I keep it 100<br/>
Got me a new clip for my .223 and that bitch hold a hundred<br/>
I'm still in the hood, I got me a check and I don't want no Nike's<br/>
Bitches, they suckin', and fuckin', they do everything except bite it<br/>
I can go slow like an old man, I can go fast like I got nitrous<br/>
Spent 20 racks for my brother's appeal and I ain't talkin' no Vicodin<br/>
Over 1 mil in this room, bitch, I kinda sound like a Pisces<br/>
Lil bitch you know I'm the bomb and 2 Chainz the light, no lightnin'<br/>
Wow, these bitches excited, me and Thugger, we 'bout to start up a riot<br/>
I ain't got no pussy all week, I'm on that "bitch, suck my dick" diet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]</i><br/>
Monica, come home to me, yea come home to me my dear<br/>
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser<br/>
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser<br/>
Teresea, I'm tired of lookin' bae, I'm into you, your rear<br/>
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser<br/>
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]</i><br/>
Ain't nothin' special man, I sold it all yester'<br/>
Pull in Phipps Plaza in a motherfuckin' Tesla<br/>
Ain't no pressure when you got a little extra<br/>
Put them beams on your face, have 'em lookin' like freckles<br/>
Dammit man, I do not no talk but no heavens sentMy bitch pussy wet like it's wetting rain<br/>
This bitch clap on me while I clap at mans, woah<br/>
Got Balenciaga's I ain't even wore yet<br/>
Half a pound of gas I ain't smoke yet<br/>
Traphouse filled up with Ziploc<br/>
Used to give my living room super big lots<br/>
In a strip club with some flip-flops<br/>
Thought it's the time, baby it's not<br/>
Got a lotta windows on my crib, nigga<br/>
Bout to put that motherfucker in a tint shop<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[PART 2: Lil Boy]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Who killed little boy, who killed little boy?<br/>
Rat infested hallways, no escape, no escape<br/>
From misery, no way out from that hell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I'm bout to give these niggas what they ask for<br/>
I used to have to argue with my land lord<br/>
Yea, my nickname is Tity Boi<br/>
Bitch gotta have at least a handful<br/>
All my cribs came with a damn pool<br/>
Used to stash work in my camel<br/>
Young 6'5" with the handle<br/>
If you don't watch Atlanta then you need to turn the channel<br/>
See I pull up in this bitch in a Phantom<br/>
Front grill looking like it's dancin' (it is)<br/>
Put some stacks on your head little boy (lil boy)<br/>
Yeah they 'bout to call you the grandson (lil boy)<br/>
Pussy nigga gonna need a tampon (lil boy)<br/>
Put rifle bullets in a handgun (lil boy)<br/>
Keep a bankroll on me, nigga<br/>
By the time I eat some bacon I got bands on<br/>
All my cars I done put rims on 'em<br/>
I done touched down, no end zone<br/>
All that bitch do is run her mouth, nigga<br/>
On the right but that bitch got a Sprint phone<br/>
Man she got about 100 acres<br/>
Enough yard for me to put a couple Benz's on<br/>
And I just pop me a perc<br/>
I might fuck that bitch with my Timbs on<br/>
(Truuuuuu)
