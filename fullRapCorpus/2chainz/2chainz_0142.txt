Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah...<br/>
Yeah believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you<br/>
Who else gon' believe in you? Who else gon' believe in you?<br/>
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?<br/>
Who else gon' believe in you, who else gon' believe in you?<br/>
<br/>
Believe in yourself, health is wealth<br/>
Gotta get mine, faster than a step<br/>
I can make a hundred thousand just sitting by the steps<br/>
I can count a hundred thousand with my feet in the chair<br/>
I can pull the baddest broad in here<br/>
With my hand pulled behind my back<br/>
One hand on the steering wheel<br/>
2 Chainz with the ponytail, got the bodyguard concealed<br/>
Ill meaning of sickness, I use the pharmacy as a witness<br/>
I mean anything around me that's against us, they can't be<br/>
I got God on my side, that's all I need to ride<br/>
See that's all I need to vibe, asking what I do tonight<br/>
That's really none of your business, unless you wanna get in this<br/>
<br/>
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way<br/>
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way<br/>
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way<br/>
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way<br/>

Mydoors go dat way, doors go dat way<br/>
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way<br/>
My doors, wraith, my doors, uh<br/>

I'm good, I'm good like Ye<br/>
I'm good like Sean and Push<br/>
I'm good, I'm good, okay<br/>
Good, sold yay, good 4 way<br/>
Oh man, look at me now<br/>
Used to have a killer crossover<br/>
Now I think I done crossed over<br/>
White fans at my rap shows<br/>
So many chains on I give you the cold shoulder<br/>
So many chains on, I tell 'em move over<br/>
Big shit over here, boy<br/>
100 acres on my property, man I might hit a deer, boy<br/>
I got felonies that's older than y'all niggas<br/>
Family time at the mall, nigga<br/>
6'5", I never been small, nigga<br/>
Your swag like RuPaul, I'm appalled, nigga<br/>
Yeah, three calls to call food<br/>
I want some Nobu, met her at Whole Foods<br/>
I just ate Pro Tools, I am the go-to<br/>
<br/>
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way<br/>
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way<br/>
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way<br/>
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way<br/>
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way<br/>
Mydoors go dat way, doors go dat way<br/>
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way<br/>
My doors, Wraith, my doors, uh<br/>

Felonies that's older than y'all niggas<br/>
Family time at the mall, nigga<br/>
6'5", I never been small, nigga<br/>
Your swag like RuPaul, I'm appalled, nigga<br/>
Yeah, three calls to call food<br/>
I want some Nobu, met her at Whole Foods<br/>
I just ate Pro Tools, I am the go-to<br/>

Trap shit, I'm the go to<br/>
Trap nigga with a gold tooth<br/>
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?<br/>
