<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah <i>[x2]</i><br/>
2 Chainzzz<br/>
If I ain't at the party<br/>
Then it ain't started<br/>
This is trend setting<br/>
You niggas is trend following<br/>
I don't care if she's modelling<br/>
As long as she's swallowing<br/>
Bitches all around my crib<br/>
I got hoes all on my ottoman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yea I love these girls<br/>
Bitches on my dick<br/>
Been around the world<br/>
Ain't seen shit like this<br/>
Ain't seen shit<br/>
Ain't seen shit<br/>
Ain't seen shit like this<br/>
Ain't seen shit<br/>
Ain't seen shit<br/>
Ain't seen shit like this<br/>
From the back, to the front<br/>
She the employee of the month<br/>
She shook her back then front,<br/>
She the employee of the month<br/>
Back, front<br/>
I'm back, to frontin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I did what I said I would anyway<br/>
I do this shit, like anyday<br/>
Nigga want to play around like a playground<br/>
Nigga laydown, look at that trigger plate<br/>
Southside, lean with the my MI-WI<br/>
Started from the inside, drag his ass outside<br/>
Chain so big you can see that shit from the blind side<br/>
At their neck like a bow tie, I'mma be a multi<br/>
Opposite of broke<br/>
You can't go where I go<br/>
Mop their ass, they got a motherfucking dry floor<br/>
And I walk on a tight rope<br/>
I got balance and them Balenciagas<br/>
And I woke up, whole enchilada<br/>
I got a bitch beside, I got a bitch beside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Cause everybody needs love<br/>
We never seem to get enough<br/>
I'll show you what it's made of<br/>
Just need you to lift me up<br/>
(Lift me up <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
