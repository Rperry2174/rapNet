<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I be riding through the park like I'm A-Rod<br/>
Walking through the park like I'm A-Rod<br/>
Smoking on that strong, that's that steroid<br/>
They tryna kick me out like A-Rod<br/>
I used to run the base like A-Rod<br/>
When I get me a check, I'ma buy me some extra<br/>
When I get me a check, I'ma buy me a necklace<br/>
When I get me a check, I'ma eat her for breakfast<br/>
When I get me a check, niggas gotta respect it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I earned all my stripes like A-Rod, worth 25 mill<br/>
That's a whole lot of money, man somebody get killed<br/>
Que pasa, que pasa, you know that I'm proper, I run with my partners<br/>
We need us a doctor, for drinkinl the vodka<br/>
That pi√±a colada, I might shit a lobster<br/>
I just said that shit with my eyes closed<br/>
I can count a hundred thousand while I'm blindfolded<br/>
CUI nigga, watch I get to it<br/>
CUI nigga, the chopper under influence<br/>
Now watch how I limp to the bank, dreads hanging under my A hat<br/>
If I got sucked by a teller I would never tell you but that would be Bankhead<br/>
A1 nigga from the south side, I need a spot light<br/>
I need a chinchilla, before I get frostbite<br/>
Put the white girl in the middle, call it Klondike<br/>
Take her the to the room after dinner, and fuck her like it's prom night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: French Montana]</i><br/>
Move around my town like A-Rod<br/>
Playing with that girl like Baywatch, Tony Hawk skate off<br/>
Steriod, on your ass like Hemorrhoids, cash out with that pen boy<br/>
Your pass out see the invoice<br/>
When I get that check, I'ma call Madonna<br/>
Call up Cameron Diaz, call up Daisy Fuentes<br/>
Dikembe on them hoes like no-no, not in my house<br/>
You can smoke and you can drink and bend it over and let me play<br/>
God dammit I came up, nigga<br/>
35K take the plane up, nigga<br/>
35 cars, 35 chains, nigga<br/>
Gettin' this change, never changed up, nigga<br/>
When I get me a check, I'ma buy you a fake ass<br/>
With your fake ass, we don't count money, weigh cash<br/>
Breakin' up the rock, Dame Dash<br/>
When you're talkin' 'bout work, was my day job<br/>
Playin' with the base like A-Rod<br/>
Playin' with the <i>[?]</i> since yay high<br/>
Mix it up, drink it, stay high<br/>
<br/>
