<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick<br/>
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick<br/>
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches<br/>
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches<br/>
Blue cheese in my Off Whites<br/>
I've been drinkin' codeine all night<br/>
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight<br/>
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
My side chick got pregnant by her main dude and I'm offended<br/>
I called, she ain't pick up, I text her back, bitch you stingy<br/>
I'm in all black like a ninja, chain got influenza<br/>
Walk in the traphouse, use my Cartiers for credentials (God damn!)<br/>
I'm going wildebeest, all on my enemies<br/>
Negative energy, I could do anything, I got the guillotine<br/>
Off with they head<br/>
Known to pull off and get head<br/>
Drippin so much sauce on your bitch look like she wettin' the bed<br/>
I could do more than just say it, strip club veteran head uh uh!<br/>
I am still gettin' this bread, bought her a Birkin bag uh uh!<br/>
Everyone look at the tag, I do the digital dash uh uh!<br/>
I can do more than just brag, I can back it up uh uh!<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Offset:]</i><br/>
Blue cheese, no ranch, all hunnids<br/>
10 racks on me that's mall money<br/>
I just bought a Lamb Ima crawl on it<br/>
Get on top, she act a dog with it<br/>
I'm on this drink need to slow down<br/>
Racks in back it won't slow down<br/>
You had a sack but it's gone now<br/>
Safari diamond, money long now<br/>
Better wake up, smell the coffee<br/>
Black man with a lot of money, got the white man wanna off me<br/>
You was my mans but you lost me<br/>
Poppin' xans, I'm exhausted<br/>
Cookie smellin' like a mosh pit<br/>
Pop a perk, kinda nauseous<br/>
50 <i>[?]</i> shit colossus<br/>
Hey, with this money I could stay up and survive<br/>
We go live, smoke this dope and ride<br/>
We too fly, bad bitches in the archive<br/>
Oh so high, money make me so high<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Takeoff:]</i><br/>
I'm havin' blue cheese<br/>
And I'ma get it by any means<br/>
Flexing on niggas like Hercules<br/>
Fucking on bitches with double D's<br/>
I met the plug, got 100 keys<br/>
Give me that block and I gotta seize<br/>
These niggas sick homie wanna get rid of me<br/>
I'm at the top and they under me<br/>
I hit the lot and don't ask for the tag<br/>
Racks in my pockets, they lookin' like kneepads<br/>
Flexin' my all white with Benjamin Franklin<br/>
Put the work steady blue cheese in the bag<br/>
My life I'm livin' it fast<br/>
One thing I cannot do is go out sad<br/>
They know me but don't know my past<br/>
And if you know me you know I'm about my cash<br/>
The Nawfside, call it Baghdad, make a nigga 40 yard dash<br/>
The Nawfside, where the bags at, I was breakin' my wrist in the glass (whippin' it!)<br/>
Smoking on Barry Bonds in the Hurricane, spinning work like I'm Taz<br/>
Migos and Chainz in the city, go to your girl <i>[?]</i><br/>
Had to bring out that bag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>

Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches<br/>
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches<br/>

Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight<br/>
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs<br/>
Blue cheese in my Off Whites<br/>
I've been drinkin' codeine all night<br/>
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight<br/>
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs<br/>

<i>[Quavo &amp; 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
When you wake up in the morning<br/>
When you wake up in the morning<br/>
Blue cheese in my Off Whites<br/>
Blue cheese in my Off Whites<br/>
<br/>
Boy, my uncle 12 shawty<br/>
I had to take my uncle to school this morning shawty<br/>
And he got suspended<br/>
'Cause he smelled like weed when he got there
