<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Good head get your rent paid,<br/>
Then I cut a corner like a switch blade<br/>
Bitch made nigga talking shit about her<br/>
Got a red car so I bought a red bottom<br/>
Chillin' at the game sitting courtside<br/>
You're looking at the flyest nigga on the boat ride<br/>
Low life I'm a multi nigga fo' life<br/>
Oh my, had it up to here like a bow tie,<br/>
Cut it out sold drugs out my mommas house<br/>
So for mothers day, I bought my mom a house<br/>
Chillin' in the club standing on the couch<br/>
Nigga fuck yo couch, nigga nigga fuck yo couch!<br/>
Shoes cost more than that shit anyway<br/>
Any day, when the semi spray, better penetrate<br/>
{Brrraaatt} Better duck nigga!<br/>
Got a lake in my yard filled with ducks nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm just livin' baby, and you got that right<br/>
I'm just livin' baby, and my Jordans nice<br/>
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'<br/>
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Motherfuck the other side (Motherfuck the other side)<br/>
Motherfuck the other side (Motherfuck the other side)<br/>
Everything's official my pistol's just missin missles<br/>
As far as running game my nigga I need a whistle<br/>
My nigga I need your sister, oops, I don't think that came out<br/>
Still fuck a girl with my chain out<br/>
Still do my thing with my thing out<br/>
Long ass clip, I could shoot you without aiming<br/>
My life, your motherfucking entertainment<br/>
Dangerous, leave you with the angels,<br/>
Shoot yo' ass from all types of angles, explain this<br/>
The way I lived with a just bunch of niggas and then just me<br/>
They came close and eat yo' skeet<br/>
They tried to run and I said come back<br/>
If you think you're alone then they're about to Womack<br/>
Hold that, ridin' that Phantom down on there<br/>
Nigga said what up pimp, where the hoes at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: IAmSu]</i><br/>
Ride around on my side of town, you might fuck around and get peeled<br/>
I rock Mookie, rock Y3, got Bathing Apes on my heels<br/>
Nigga this ain't a game there ain't no competition<br/>
I knew he was a fake I got good intuition<br/>
23 and I'm still livin',<br/>
Been all around the world and it's still Richmond<br/>
Because I'm loyal to my soil, good to my hood like oil,<br/>
Got me in that water, let it boil<br/>
Bitch I'm a boy, beat the beat up like Roy<br/>
Consider your bitch my employ'<br/>
Real to the core, straight up I never been fraud,<br/>
And I put that on my lord<br/>
Ya'll rap 'bout clothes that you cannot afford<br/>
Where's the Versace and where's the Tom Ford?<br/>
Everything we rap 'bout that shit be ours<br/>
This bitch a freak she should get the award<br/>
<br/>
