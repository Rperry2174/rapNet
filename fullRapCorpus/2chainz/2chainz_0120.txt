Yeah man, you know<br/>
I just gotta get this ship off my chest, I do, I do<br/>
I'm tired of it, I'm sayin' this shit all the time<br/>
Like niggas takin' the style, niggas takin' everything a nigga do<br/>
I'm 'bout to get an alarm for my shit<br/>
Nigga get close to my shit, I'm puttin' a chirp on that shit<br/>
Shit gon' go off on niggas<br/>
Brr brr! You know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
<br/>
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr<br/>
<br/>
I got Bloods in Savannah<br/>
I got Crips on Old National<br/>
On your ho like a fashion<br/>
Pinky ring on Alaska<br/>
Illest nigga in Nebraska<br/>
Nigga fake like wrastlin'<br/>
Got cash or plastic<br/>
Big cash, cappin'<br/>
Six Flags, lotta rides<br/>
Turn the beat to a homicide<br/>
Microphone look mortified<br/>
Lyrical bullets is a .45<br/>
I'm doin' 75 on the 75<br/>
85 off of 85<br/>
200 on 285<br/>
None of my cars take 89<br/>
Down to get money any time<br/>
Life a bitch with no panty line<br/>
Us versus the other squad<br/>
Stash spot is my boxer shorts<br/>
Just stickin' to the protocol<br/>
Weed smellin' like underarm<br/>
Turn you suckers into bubblegum<br/>
<br/>
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr<br/>
<br/>
I just might stand on the car<br/>
Stand on the wall<br/>
Logos on my bag<br/>
Logo on my scarf<br/>
Yeah I met her tonight<br/>
Fuck her tomorrow<br/>
You know how we are<br/>
You know who we are<br/>
Yeah the trap is my workplace<br/>
You know I came from a hurt place<br/>
Had to reverse it to first place<br/>
To father, hustler in first place<br/>
And I said word for word<br/>
I usually smoke at work<br/>
I either smirk or flirt<br/>
Took it from hard to vert<br/>
I got some word to off<br/>
Them bitches bumpin' soft<br/>
Young niggas stealin' sauce<br/>
I'm tryna drill 'em off<br/>
I'm tryna kill this off<br/>
I bring the women out<br/>
I'm 'bout to build a house<br/>
Then I'ma rent it out, woah!<br/>
<br/>
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr<br/>
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr<br/>
<br/>
You already know that's me though, stay drenched<br/>
Every time you see me, I'm drenched<br/>
I'm the freshest nigga in the room, you dig what I'm sayin'?<br/>
I'm soaked, uh<br/>
We gon' need some wet floor signs in here, people, please<br/>
It's the drench god, we don't want nobody to fall<br/>
Slip up on this sauce, mane
