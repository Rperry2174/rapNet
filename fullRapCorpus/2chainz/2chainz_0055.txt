<i>[Intro: Sunni Patterson]</i><br/>
And when you spiral through the atmosphere<br/>
All they see is motion<br/>
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain<br/>
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame<br/>
So caught up in the fantasy, humanity has made a love story out of tragedy<br/>
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge<br/>
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed<br/>
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny<br/>
Of something for the books or the bars<br/>
To bob your head and nod<br/>
I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it<br/>
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it<br/>
Mama said that "The best thing you can do and be is you<br/>
This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due"<br/>
Ain't that the truth<br/>
And here you are, a black unicorn<br/>
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born<br/>
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way<br/>
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say<br/>
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed<br/>
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down<br/>
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found<br/>
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Free at last, free at last<br/>
That's what I said when I got out my last deal<br/>
Some people can't relate, sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit<br/>
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucets<br/>
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments<br/>
And everything is a obstacle<br/>
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital<br/>
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere<br/>
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years<br/>
Yeah, and that's my car talking<br/>
Old school running with the dogs barking<br/>
Parked out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins<br/>
Weed so strong I be seldom coughin<br/>
And I'm covered in Balmain<br/>
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette<br/>
Sellin' that parcake, life aint no arcade<br/>
Now I got more knives than the 4th grade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chrisette Michele]</i><br/>
Its all I really want<br/>
Its all I really want to be<br/>
Its all I really need<br/>
I want, I want to believe<br/>
Thought you had the best of me<br/>
Now I'm what you need, you need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Hear ye, hear ye<br/>
You cant come near me<br/>
Competition must fear me<br/>
Lyrically, I could be Talib Kweli<br/>
But with gold teeth it'd be hard for some to believe<br/>
I leave them pussys stinkin like Summer's eve<br/>
I practicin' repitition now I need a hundred G's<br/>
A hundred M's, hug and squeeze<br/>
Dad kept us in the Dungarees, rather rap but I love the cheese<br/>
I change hoes like I change gears<br/>
And my yard so big I got pet deers<br/>
And my homies try to act like aint real<br/>
I put my apron on and taught myself how to make meals<br/>
You need a focus group, my group focus<br/>
Hit the loker jokers with the hocus pocus<br/>
I'm the dopest you can quote this under scope<br/>
Its just me and GOAT,<br/>
Dirty ass niggas will sell your ass a key of soap<br/>
I'da seen em rich, I'da seen em broke<br/>
I'da seen it all watch the pregnant lady smoke<br/>
When the baby come out it gon' be geeked<br/>
You never know he might come out to be me<br/>
<br/>
