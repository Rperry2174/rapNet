<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You could tell by my clothes I got a lot of hoes<br/>
Plus I got a bankroll I got a lot of hoes<br/>
I Got a lot of hoes<br/>
A lot of hoes<br/>
A lot of hoes<br/>
A lot of hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
They say my mind gone I'm in a different time zone<br/>
I count 100, 000 dollars while I'm blindfold<br/>
I'm bout that guacamole no fronting coping only<br/>
Cop a Rollie, I get a lot cheese macaroni<br/>
Ya I'm back up on it bitch I'm back up on it<br/>
And when I stand still she put her back up on it<br/>
You now I love rich, cause I'm hood rich<br/>
Your girl call me GD I got that good dick<br/>
Fucked up, coupe big, polo stupid<br/>
Brown shirt, brown man, same color roof in<br/>
We used to shoot hoop and listen to that Snoop here<br/>
Bought a pack, brought it back, relaxed and recouped here<br/>
Ya this a new year and ya these some new shades<br/>
I don't see none of y'all talking about some new J's<br/>
This is that Prada, property, properly<br/>
When I hit Saks Fifth it looks like a robbery<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
