<i>[Intro - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Paid $100 for some head, nigga, Say you ain’t did it!<br/>
I know a lick at 4 mil', nigga, Say you ain’t with it!<br/>
Now if we hit this lick, nigga, &amp; you don’t want to split it<br/>
Then it’s bow, bow, bow to your motherfuckin' fitted, now!<br/>
I don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a fuck!<br/>
I pull up in that truck, Pull up in that truck<br/>
I run that bitch over, call it Trukfit<br/>
And yeah I’m on my own, I’m screamin' "Fuck it"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Fuck it, I’m whippin' it crazy<br/>
I’m ridin' the foreign, I’m doin' 180<br/>
My chain so heavy, my brain so deadly<br/>
Type of nigga buy the watch &amp; change the bezzy<br/>
They ain’t never seen me comin' like this<br/>
Smokin' on that gasoline in the VIP<br/>
They need ding-a-ling for the trampoline<br/>
Cause all these bitches want to do is jump on the dick<br/>
I hop over fence, I’m offended by co-defendants<br/>
Drink codeine for mornin' sickness<br/>
Your dad was a motherfuckin' snitch, so nigga, you were born a witness<br/>
Allstate, accident forgiveness<br/>
Say my name by accident, We actin' ignorant<br/>
Doing a drive-by while you playin' different<br/>
This that Me Time at the finest<br/>
You won't beat me or see me whinin'<br/>
I am gangsta like the Raiders cap with a Jheri Curl on the side<br/>
I like thighs &amp; breasts, I hide from stress<br/>
I don’t even know where my phone at<br/>
Crib so motherfuckin big, I don’t even know where my room at!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Whip so fast they say ''there he go''<br/>
Bitch so bad, man, I think she know<br/>
Turned 100 to a mill, man I think they know<br/>
Ducking on the low, man, I think they know<br/>
I think they know, I think they know<br/>
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know<br/>
I think they know, I think they know<br/>
I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I think they know it, if they don’t then fuck it I show it<br/>
Blow it like you owe it, ordered a case of Moet<br/>
Y'all get to going back to back for us<br/>
All black like I’m wanted<br/>
Got your bitch zoning, send her back in the morning<br/>
That money coming, trying to stack it enormous<br/>
You niggas pussy, fucking rat on your homies<br/>
I think they know it, they know it, they know it<br/>
I got a plane that’s sittin round the corner<br/>
I got some bitches here from California<br/>
Got on my chains, I’m lookin like a dope boy<br/>
These niggas don’t want it, I put that on mañana<br/>
My chain into 100, my belt Ferragamo<br/>
Go to LA, meet the plug at Katanas<br/>
I’m still the king of my city and they know it<br/>
And I paint pictures with these words, I’m a poet<br/>
And I drop the top on my whip, and we soarin'<br/>
A 50 a check then I’m in it, if niggas stay with it then they get extorted<br/>
And I’m gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
