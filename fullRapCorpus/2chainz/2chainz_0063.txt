I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama<br/>
I'm like, "Damn I shoulda wore a condom."<br/>
Boom boom boom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
My shoes sold out in one day<br/>
Pull out the blueprint bumpin' dat Gunplay<br/>
In a Maybach pockets stay fat<br/>
So fly I could parallel park on a fucking runway<br/>
Going down a one way the wrong way<br/>
Shoot barrel long range<br/>
Swag like pro ball<br/>
Gave her a ring, phone call<br/>
Money talk, pole vault<br/>
Walked in, drove off<br/>
So uncomfortable at the dealership, I don't take my robe off<br/>
I wake up and I get to it<br/>
Breakfast time I might sea food it<br/>
Lunch time I might lamb chop it<br/>
And you do is talk shit like you was eatin' booty<br/>
Southside in my bloodstream<br/>
Smokin' on that propane<br/>
I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains<br/>
All white with no stains<br/>
I been trappin fore the Grammy nods<br/>
I been countin' money so long Imma need a damn hand massage<br/>
So many cars I can barely park<br/>
So many cars I need another damn garage<br/>
I'm famous with my fam around<br/>
Damn I wish I had my dad around<br/>
Gave a nigga a Lamborghini, so that's a motherfuckin' lamb-me-down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Watch how Imma kill em for the summer <i>[x2]</i> (Watch how I'ma kill em)<br/>
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama <i>[x2]</i> (I'm just flexin)<br/>
Watch how Imma kill em for the summer <i>[x2]</i> (Watch how I'ma kill em)<br/>
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama <i>[x2]</i> (I'm just flexin)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
European style my dresscode<br/>
Gunshots in the club, echo<br/>
Walk around with a .36 with six shots in my .38 Special<br/>
Black car, black Timbs<br/>
Bank of America back then<br/>
She tryna tell me her life story<br/>
And all I want is a lap dance<br/>
Good times smokin' J's rockin' J's<br/>
I'm the rap Ernie Barnes<br/>
If I paint a canvas it'd be Melee<br/>
Firearms, Viacom, maric√≥n<br/>
If she bad I invite her home<br/>
Buying chains like I'm buyin' homes<br/>
Rims taller than Kevin Hart, Ride Along<br/>
Them rhinestones you ain't shinin' nigga<br/>
I ain't hidin' so you ain't gotta find me nigga<br/>
All my clothes are designer nigga<br/>
In my back seat reclinin' nigga<br/>
Came in rockin' all gold<br/>
And I'm fuckin' all yall hoes<br/>
Smokin' on that Lee Haney<br/>
Sippin' on that hard boiled<br/>
This that get back click clack get back<br/>
Smokin' on Raw paper, this ain't zig zags<br/>
Snakeskin wallpaper, rose gold chandelier<br/>
I'm lookin' for a baby eater<br/>
Can I get a volunteer?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama<br/>
I'm like "Damn I shoulda wore a condom"<br/>
Boom boom boom
