I been on the road so long, I forgot what kind of cars I got<br/>
I rap so much I forgot what kind of bars I got<br/>
Rose in the concrete, rose to the top<br/>
Son of a gun, raised by a Glock<br/>
Georgia Power was off I was raised in the dark I don't know if it faze me or not<br/>
No telling<br/>
If I didn't turn 15 I wouldn't have been a felon (I bought it)<br/>
I bought the violence in my stick shift<br/>
If you don't shoot or get shot at you ain't go through adolescents<br/>
If you ain't go through all the pressure, You ain't get all of your blessings<br/>
What you know about not being able to re up going through depression<br/>
What you do about aggression, What you do about confession<br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
<br/>
Crunching numbers with <i>[?]</i> heads<br/>
7 figures in Buckhead<br/>
I get dope too that's enough bread<br/>
Money tall so it's enough said<br/>
It was toom poom, Baby amp and big U stand for upset<br/>
I can tell you where the plug at he over there where my cuz at<br/>
Say I'm under the influence I was down stairs where the drugs at<br/>
40 cal, 50 cal, even my momma tote a pistol now<br/>
They call on that Crenshaw only thing we need is a mister child<br/>
You already know what this about, I shouldn't be riding around with this amount<br/>
Cause I can take your bitch with this amount<br/>
And take her on a trip with this amount<br/>
I look like a lick, act like I'm rich<br/>
Talk like a whip, walk like a brick<br/>
Fly like a blimp, right over the public<br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing<br/>
<br/>
