<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I'ma tell you, I'ma tell you this right now<br/>
If you, if you woke up this mornin', nigga you winnin' for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I got a big amount, I took a different route<br/>
I am the pick of the litter<br/>
I was in juvy, they gave me community<br/>
I had to pick up some litter<br/>
I want it easy, please do not tease me<br/>
I wore my Yeezys to dinner<br/>
This is the season, I got the seasonin'<br/>
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas<br/>
I got my reasons, you wanna please me<br/>
Send me the pussy, not pictures<br/>
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'<br/>
She turn to freak on the liquor<br/>
Yeah, I am a boss on these bitches<br/>
Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches<br/>
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches<br/>
Yeah, rock Double Cross on these bitches, yeah<br/>
Dearly departed, gather today<br/>
On some Prince shit<br/>
You know what they say<br/>
Me and my safe, got a friendship<br/>
Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid<br/>
Gettin' laid<br/>
Bitch made, took off sick days<br/>
6 trey, 64 bounce, bitch, bounce<br/>
Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House<br/>
Patty melt with the hash browns<br/>
Tryna avoid all the pat downs<br/>
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes<br/>
Weirdos in the background<br/>
Black out when I back out<br/>
Blow the horn for a pedestrian<br/>
Shawty ride like an equestrian<br/>
I bought the dress that she in<br/>
Red bottoms in his and hers<br/>
Got a Rollie in his and hers<br/>
Got a car in his and hers<br/>
Walk in the zoo and say, "Pick a fur"<br/>
Last night was a blur to me<br/>
This mornin' I got two with me<br/>
I don't know what to do with me<br/>
Goin' ape like the zoo with me<br/>
Got a tool with the screw missin'<br/>
Two girls in the pool kissin'<br/>
Everywhere I go, the rod with me<br/>
Cause these niggas actin' too fishy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Fuck y'all niggas on, man?<br/>
Duffle bag forever<br/>
Just left V Live<br/>
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Look, I got a big amount<br/>
I think I'm the biggest out<br/>
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out<br/>
Lit and you can't even put it out<br/>
Got the Billboard melodies<br/>
Rap is somethin' I do on the side<br/>
Crossed over to the other side<br/>
And I didn't even have to die<br/>
Got the money and I never show it<br/>
Let a nigga try to play heroic<br/>
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams<br/>
And he say, "You bad and you know it"<br/>
Better shamone with my check then<br/>
I'm a J. Prince investment<br/>
Niggas love to talk reckless<br/>
Then see me like best friends<br/>
Got the same color FN<br/>
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin<br/>
Five stars, nothin' less than<br/>
Fuck niggas on your payroll<br/>
And you let 'em know the safe code<br/>
And you knew him for a month though<br/>
But you call them niggas big bro<br/>
You could move in the Hidden Hills<br/>
And you still don't live by the same code<br/>
I'm respected everywhere I go<br/>
Nigga, long live Bankroll<br/>
Skip the rainbow, funny stop shit<br/>
And it's straight to the pot of gold<br/>
Somebody, everybody know<br/>
6 God with the god flow
