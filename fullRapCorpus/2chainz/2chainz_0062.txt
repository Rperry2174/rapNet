<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
What is it?<br/>
Freebase<br/>
What's free about it?<br/>
I thought about it, I said, listen<br/>
Should I talk about freebase and what if, or somethin<br/>
People say well no, everybody goes and then people will start goin....<br/>
No. Let me..I gotta talk about what happened to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
See where we're from, it's all or nothing<br/>
But we take penitentiary chances like its nothing<br/>
We came from nothing, Freebase from top of the oven<br/>
Get money my type of discussion<br/>
Yaw can do this shit for free a nigga like me gone be hustlin<br/>
Freebase <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I came from nothing, me and my niggas we came from nothing<br/>
Sold that caine like it’s nothing, told you from the introduction<br/>
I came from the pain and suffering<br/>
Two pit bulls and a TEC-9<br/>
TEC-9 use to Jam up on me all the time<br/>
Swear to god if you come up in my momma yard<br/>
I’m a shoot that mutherfucker till it get tired<br/>
Big dually truck got six tires, big ties wanna rhyme mixtapes<br/>
And i keep shitting on the competition, ima bout to put up me out a shit tape<br/>
Just went playin by no rules; every night I freestyle on Pro Tools<br/>
Tell Flex come to the A we'll carjack him by one of them raggedy ass old school<br/>
I don't respect my elders, these right here Maison Margiela<br/>
I cannot get no earrings, it'll make my Rollex jealous<br/>
I been a fellon since 15, my expedition had a big screen<br/>
Half you niggas was constipated, half you niggas was Shit deep<br/>
Zone one all the way to zone 6, fuck y'all I'll buy own shit<br/>
Fuck y'all I'll buy my own whip, fuck y'all I'll buy my own brick<br/>
Tell them pussy niggas ain't pay shit, better be ready to let the gat loose<br/>
I've done a song by everybody from Jermaine Dupri down to Papoose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I came from nothing (Skrr, Skrr)<br/>
I came from nothing (Skrr, Skrr, Skrr)<br/>
I came from nothing, I came from nothing (Skrr, Skrr)<br/>
I came from nothing, I came from nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Work hard play hard work hard again<br/>
My bankroll had twins can you comprehend<br/>
Seafood lover I don't eat pork<br/>
Used to hit them J's like a 3-point<br/>
My partner mascot is a pitchfork<br/>
And you already know what this for, me too<br/>
Rent due, doggin' these hoes like a shih tzu<br/>
So cold I record it in a igloo<br/>
Nigga ask me why I don't drink<br/>
Man let me tell you what the wine do<br/>
My partner came in said that my girl<br/>
I had to tell that motherfucker mine too<br/>
Court dates in the summertime<br/>
Might pull up in a vert<br/>
No matter what the charges is<br/>
Ima pull up with a smirk<br/>
This right here for Old Nt<br/>
This right here for Godby Rd<br/>
This right here for Riverdale<br/>
Trappin at the Stop-N-Go<br/>
Trappin at the texaco<br/>
It was Amaco before it was BP<br/>
My plug from Mexico he fell out when he see me on TV<br/>
Sold drugs to my love ones and it's hard for me to admit it<br/>
The first time I've seen a crack pipe was in my parents kitchen<br/>
<br/>
