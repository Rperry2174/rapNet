Sunbathing with a Rollie on, tan all on my tattoos<br/>
All my 16s cashews, V12 when I pass you<br/>
Reminiscing about the Motorollas<br/>
Weed stronger than a Coca-Cola<br/>
Wait up, bitch, hold up, hold up<br/>
You ain't there to hold the pole up<br/>
<br/>
OG kush diet, OG kush diet<br/>
OG kush diet, OG kush diet<br/>
My partna just died, my partna just died<br/>
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck<br/>
<br/>
I'm 'bout to pour out some liquor<br/>
I'm 'bout to pour out some lean<br/>
I got blue cheese in my jeans<br/>
I bought my queen Celine<br/>
I got my team Supreme<br/>
It ain't no in between<br/>
You either in or you out, I took a different route<br/>
I had to figure it out, I went to picking them out, you, you<br/>
<br/>
Fuck what you thinking, fuck what you thinking<br/>
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks<br/>
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house<br/>
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house<br/>
<br/>
Presidential prolly tickled, laughing 'bout who popped the pistol<br/>
That's the issue, just got a rental, just for instrumentals<br/>
I'ma keep the bitch 'til December<br/>
And park it on Broadway, away from the hallway<br/>
Away from the 'partments, away from the arcades<br/>
We don't play games with them boys<br/>
We bring the pain to them boys<br/>
I caught a plane with them boys<br/>
I taught the game to them boys<br/>
I am ashamed of them boys<br/>
Blame it on fame, blame it on whatever you wanna blame<br/>
I'm smart and insane, imagine a genius that don't have a brain<br/>
That live off of resources, that learned off of geek sources<br/>
I do play with 3 persons, I got it from researching<br/>
I'm fresher than detergent, I'm fresher than each person<br/>
I walk out and eat Church's, gig without rehearsing<br/>
Watch how I resurface, watch how I rework it, gas<br/>
Im fresher than detergent, I'm fresher than each person<br/>
I walk out and eat churches, gig without rehearsing<br/>
Watch how I resurface, watch how i rework it, Gas<br/>
<br/>
OG kush diet, OG kush diet<br/>
OG kush diet, OG kush diet<br/>
My partna just died, my partna just died<br/>
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck<br/>
<br/>
Fuck what you thinking, fuck what you thinking<br/>
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks<br/>
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house<br/>
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, your favorite rapper's got no talent<br/>
Homeboy got coke habits<br/>
Used to drive a Porsche 'til I found out it was made by Volkswagen<br/>
This here is a toe tag 'em, Tity Boi gon' and toe tag 'em<br/>
Go ahead, hook they ass up to the tow truck<br/>
Let them know this a throat slashing<br/>
Your baby mama got no passion<br/>
Her best friend act old fashioned<br/>
Tell her take them panties off when she walk around my boat laughing<br/>
I'm V.I.P. at the yacht club, nigga you look like you not loved<br/>
Stars in my double R so clean I drive in white gloves<br/>
Sea bass with the white sauce, hopped out, get wiped off<br/>
Presence been felt everywhere<br/>
Except let me see, yeah the White House<br/>
Space age like 8 ball, MJG, Nate Dogg<br/>
Sippin' quavo, ridin' offsets, guess I'm 'bout to take off<br/>
<br/>
OG kush diet, OG kush diet<br/>
OG kush diet, OG kush diet<br/>
My partna just died, my partna just died<br/>
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck<br/>
<br/>
Fuck what you thinking, fuck what you thinking<br/>
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks<br/>
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house<br/>
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house
