<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I have them thoughts<br/>
Like I'm too real for this shit<br/>
Labels keep callin'<br/>
I need 2 mil for this shit!<br/>
Took a mixtape<br/>
Turned it to a mansion<br/>
Then I took my last pack<br/>
And it turned into gymnastics<br/>
The crazy thing about it<br/>
I been knew I had it<br/>
I was being patient, y'all was being stagnant<br/>
The crazy thing about it<br/>
I been gettin' money<br/>
I been gettin' pussy<br/>
Shades cost 600<br/>
The crazy thing about it<br/>
I don't need nobody<br/>
I don't need no co-signer<br/>
talking 'bout I got 'em<br/>
The crazy thing about it<br/>
Everything been crazy<br/>
My girl cousin died<br/>
Now who gon' take care of them babies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
A-Town, we got one<br/>
Westside, we got one<br/>
Eastside, we got one<br/>
Southside, we got one<br/>
Got one, I got one<br/>
This pistol on me, I got one<br/>
This check homie, I got one<br/>
Respect homie, I got one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
This polo, not Izod<br/>
I get dough like Tae Kwon<br/>
Asking me what I'm on<br/>
I say my bank account is on steroids<br/>
Trappin' off my Android<br/>
Tryin' not to go fed for it<br/>
Cause I'm so high, talkin' I'm so fly<br/>
I don't know if I should l land for it<br/>
Addicted to codeine<br/>
My side effect is a red girl<br/>
If I buy the pussy you payin' for it<br/>
Put your head through the headboard<br/>
I say it but, I don't get no cred for it<br/>
Pull up in that short bus<br/>
Tell 'em this a sped tour<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
