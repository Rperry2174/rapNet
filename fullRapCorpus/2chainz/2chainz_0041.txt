<i>[Intro: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Whip cold, get dough, different flows<br/>
I killed the last beat, I'm out on parole<br/>
You know the code, point scene, money gone<br/>
You know what I'm on, pass the styrofoam<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good<br/>
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good<br/>
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good<br/>
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Hey, motivated, woke up like I'm gonna make it<br/>
I had a dream I seen Serena playin' tennis naked<br/>
Formulate a plot, conversate with Glocks<br/>
Bang bang motherfucker this is gun talk<br/>
I got a fresh pair step and get fresh air<br/>
Yves St. Laurent spring collect wear, yeah<br/>
And I've been on my paper route<br/>
A lot of zeros in my motherfuckin' bank account<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
One of a kind, Bond Number Nine<br/>
Powder on my chest, diamonds on my neck<br/>
I drop the work and make it back flip<br/>
I'm a walking poster child for Saks Fifth<br/>
In the catalog where it say next year<br/>
Put my order in this is Corvette gear<br/>
In the T top with her knees cocked<br/>
I'm so motherfuckin' high nigga tree top<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I feel good, laid back, feet up<br/>
I know my money low, I just re'd up<br/>
Got my car, no keys but<br/>
Left the Gucci store, all G'd up<br/>
Yeah, on to the next one<br/>
If you see smoke, that's our section<br/>
If you see ho's, that's our selection<br/>
At the strip club during a recession<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
