As I met 2 Chainz a few minutes ago, as I gazed into his face, I felt that I was in the presence of royalty<br/>
There's a certain power presence that he gives off<br/>
I tried to be, everything you want and need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
'Cause you got a deep title don't mean that you deep<br/>
Substance shallow on shit creek, I heard Cole speak<br/>
About the bricks, Kendrick got Compton lit<br/>
And I've been lit ever since I sold nicks<br/>
Never fabricated about my fabric, the scale, that's my apparatus<br/>
I give a fuck about the sorriest rappers<br/>
This actually happened, path in the back pathogenic<br/>
Moved that blow out like we were afrocentric<br/>
I had a front row entry, I had the codeine kidney<br/>
I made up the Bentiaga truck, you owe me a Bentley<br/>
This the rap Ken Griffey, got at least 10 with me<br/>
Got at least 10 on me, I'm anti-phony<br/>
My girl anti-bony and she get that money<br/>
I bought all this shit, don't go acting anti on me<br/>
It's Mr. Epps in the bank, I give a F what you think<br/>
I bought a Tesla today, there's nothing left in your tank<br/>
I did everything except a fucking song with Jay<br/>
But I murdered every song I fucking did with Ye<br/>
See my verses are better and my subject is realer<br/>
See my mom was an addict and my dad was the dealer<br/>
And their son is that nigga, I'm no Black activist<br/>
I'm a Black millionaire, give you my Black ass to kiss<br/>
We used the tree for a fence, I used to land in the trench<br/>
Used to dust myself off, then I eat me some shrimp<br/>
Coulda did anything, I coulda been me a pimp<br/>
I coulda went to the league, I took it straight to the rim<br/>
I took it straight to the block, I got Xans in my sock<br/>
I got plans for the pot, I got bands, you do not, huh<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you a miracle. Right now, if you hear this, you're a miracle, I want you to know that<br/>
If you're able to hear this right now, you are a miracle. Straight up, no kapp<br/>
<br/>
I'm more Gucci than Vans, give you a Gucci advance<br/>
This the chance of your life, you ain't prepared for your life<br/>
See the man without a mic is just a mic gimmick<br/>
Anyone, Jordan, Jackson, Tyson, Bivens<br/>
Phone number unlisted<br/>
Gave her the digits to a number that is long distance<br/>
She on the wrong mission and got my palm itching<br/>
I had it on me, you can see it in my prom pictures, ugh<br/>
<br/>
I'm telling you, niggas like me fall out the sky. You don't just bump into me. I'm a real blessing, bro, nah, for real, bro<br/>
<br/>
You know the times is rough, you know the times is hard<br/>
I never trust my neighbors, so we got burglar bars<br/>
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard<br/>
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, yeah, okay<br/>
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard<br/>
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars<br/>
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard<br/>
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, Lord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Monica:]</i><br/>
Lord knows<br/>
Woke up today, gave thanks<br/>
Grateful to see another day, then the storm came<br/>
As the night falls, I shed my blood, sweat and tears<br/>
Let the rain fall, let it fall, let it fall<br/>
One day<br/>
Your love will take me right over the stars, Lord knows<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
That soulful trap music, man. Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Section 8, I'm talkin' 'bout the 'partments<br/>
You stay in the middle, someone stay on top of you, someone stay below you<br/>
What you know about grabbing a broom and shit and hitting upstairs like, "Y'all stop fucking stomping! Y'all stop walking so mothafuckin' hard!"<br/>
Then the people downstairs, they doing the same shit to us. Tru, trill shit
