<i>[2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I'm popular and poppin dough<br/>
Breakfast at Papa Deaux's<br/>
Dodgin all obstacles<br/>
Trappin at the Stop-N-Go<br/>
Boy you know you lame if you still ridin stop and go<br/>
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle<br/>
Pardon though I'm hardin though<br/>
You should read the article<br/>
I'm ridin high and dodgin hoes<br/>
You better hope I'm dodgin your model hoes<br/>
Dollar hoes, white lookin Madonna hoes<br/>
Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo and the Prada hoes<br/>
College hoes on three, niggaz with a lot of dough<br/>
I Snoop guard the dough, I just love bein by the stove<br/>
Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul<br/>
Like a comma, I love bein right next to O's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I had a long day, my nerves bad<br/>
Yea I'm smokin on loud I know you heard that<br/>
Hit the jewlery store, with a hundred grand<br/>
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands<br/>
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand<br/>
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands<br/>
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands<br/>
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J Hard]</i><br/>
We sittin high speakin like we super human Benz<br/>
Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans<br/>
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and<br/>
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus<br/>
They say money is the root of all diseases<br/>
Well call the doctor I see honest in my thesis<br/>
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks<br/>
Baby momma sayin I'm impatient my sons need shit<br/>
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips<br/>
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips<br/>
In Ziplocks, and garbage bags<br/>
Usher Raymond in this bitch yeah "I got it bad"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz]</i><br/>
(2 Chainz!) My plug need me, but he greedy<br/>
I ran off told me catch me on the TV<br/>
See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul<br/>
I'm yellin fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard<br/>
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference<br/>
Pussy on lock down, I don't handcuff it<br/>
Sippin Grey Goose and we spendin mad ducats<br/>
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance<br/>
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds<br/>
Gucci flip flaps, I got bunyons on bunyons<br/>
Yellow ring look like a Funyon, or somethin<br/>
I just left the trap house, money on money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
