I'm walkin' like I got a kilo<br/>
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo<br/>
Pinky ring minus 30 below<br/>
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero<br/>
Walkin' like I got a kilo<br/>
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo<br/>
Pinky ring minus 30 below<br/>
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero<br/>
<br/>
I come in this bitch so fast, let me slow up on niggas<br/>
I fuckin' that bitch with the ass, and she hold up on niggas<br/>
You know that I'm drinkin', I pour up on niggas<br/>
My style, and just like I throw up on niggas<br/>
I don't fuck with niggas especially a ho nigga<br/>
VIP, I pour MoÃ«t on niggas, ayy<br/>
Triple beam to a digital scale, I got work in the mail<br/>
Clientele, I need a tractor trailer and a Ms Griselda<br/>
And I ain't into failure, and I don't even know what to tell you<br/>
I got no work to sell you<br/>
I got hope to sell you, got me a boat to sail in<br/>
Ain't no joke like Rakim<br/>
Got the trap house rockin', you ain't get that shit<br/>
I got me a half, that's a split when I flip it<br/>
And whip it 'til I get me 36s<br/>
I get it, I got it, I'm slangin' narcotics<br/>
I sold dope in college, I'm semi psychotic<br/>
Might put the semi on niggas<br/>
Never keep bricks in mi casa<br/>
<br/>
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo<br/>
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo<br/>
Pinky ring minus 30 below<br/>
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero<br/>
Walkin' like I got a kilo<br/>
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo<br/>
Pinky ring minus 30 below<br/>
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero<br/>
<br/>
I do this shit for the A<br/>
Y'all get the fuck out my way<br/>
I bought a car just to race it<br/>
I pass the car just to chase it<br/>
This is a standing ovation<br/>
The trap was my standin' location<br/>
Hit the strip club in the day shift<br/>
Give a lil' bitch a donation<br/>
Fresh to my bootlaces<br/>
I just beat me a few cases<br/>
I just told myself...<br/>
"Self, I need me a new bracelet"<br/>
Who the fakest? You the fakest<br/>
Lose or take it, rule to bacon, rude awaken<br/>
You forsaken, you replacement<br/>
Got me a jacuzzi in the basement<br/>
If it was a real nigga party<br/>
You couldn't get an invitation<br/>
You niggas is basic, you bitches is basic<br/>
I'm fuckin' two hoes in two different locations<br/>
You sittin' adjacent, you need a rotation<br/>
You need a quotation<br/>
Oh my medulla is mula<br/>
That pussy so close I can taste it<br/>
<br/>
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo<br/>
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo<br/>
Pinky ring minus 30 below<br/>
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero<br/>
Walkin' like I got a kilo<br/>
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo<br/>
Pinky ring minus 30 below<br/>
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
