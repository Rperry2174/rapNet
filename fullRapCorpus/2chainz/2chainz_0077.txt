<i>[Hook - 2 Chainz &amp; Skooly:]</i><br/>
Pull on the ballet and look like <i>[?]</i> on my shit<br/>
Talk inside waiting for the beamer on my shit<br/>
Ain't no Activis so I lean on my bitch<br/>
I brought her with a bad bitch, I got a fining for this<br/>
All that I need is a gun, I promise to keep it 100<br/>
The coupe ain't come with no keys, not when you spending 100<br/>
A nigga think this is a disease, can't even keep it a 100<br/>
I keep it a 100, my pocket look so with the cheese<br/>
How many niggas with me? I think it's a 100<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Short Dawg:]</i><br/>
Half of these rapper sucks, they nead a pacifier<br/>
Truth be told the other half are liars<br/>
<i>[?]</i> more will do in the foreign coupe<br/>
Rings on it like a appetizing<br/>
Got a life fresh where you've been<br/>
Nigga that's personal<br/>
I'm doing a verse more because the work is slow<br/>
Keeping it 100 like the purpose's goal<br/>
I'm authentic keep my car's tinted<br/>
Probably cause I got your broad in it<br/>
The way she walking got my palms hitching<br/>
Money talks <i>[?]</i> in it<br/>
The TIU up on my <i>[?]</i><br/>
Got my own limit on a car engine<br/>
Because niggas know I'm from the H town<br/>
So I'm coming down like a partition<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cap 1:]</i><br/>
Making all of these fucking Gs<br/>
They can't even keep it 100<br/>
I got the trap bumping, nigga what you want?<br/>
Probably put in your order<br/>
I got them birds in the water, that's on my son and my daughter<br/>
I made a half from a quarter, I might hit this helling business<br/>
Nigga fleeping pigeons, bought a Rollie flood at the border<br/>
Say are you my nigga? Then la familia<br/>
I can make a phone call and I get rid of you<br/>
You can't have this bitch; I don't even consider her<br/>
We offer them pounds like Jennifer nigga<br/>
The trap phone steady ringing<br/>
Money count and steady spinning<br/>
I just put a pound of Lenix<br/>
We got this shit from the tranches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skooly:]</i><br/>
Married to the game, need a ring out this bitch<br/>
I'm may go insane, I'm not the king to this shit<br/>
I'm a zombie, I want brain, I'll be fining for this<br/>
Wooh, that shout never changed ain't no reason for it<br/>
Trying to get the lean out of my piss<br/>
Trying to get the Gs out my bitch<br/>
I had an uncle, used to smuggle, got 4 keys in this bitch<br/>
So many Gs in this bitch, but I'm not easy to spill<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, I was the dope, I'm the lean in the seal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kaleb:]</i><br/>
When it was small faces, I was keeping it 100<br/>
Spend the 10s, 20s, 50s all I keep is the 100<br/>
My money here, don't come stop it because it <i>[?]</i> just like money<br/>
And my kilo like my car, yeah the Porsche do 200<br/>
I'm riding for all of my niggas, no car pull<br/>
Professionals with the music, we pros with the tools<br/>
How can I lose?<br/>
I came her with nothing, go nothing to lose<br/>
We out there, <i>[?]</i>, got quality music so how can we shnooze?
