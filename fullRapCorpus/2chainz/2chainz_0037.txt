<i>[Intro: John Legend]</i><br/>
My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn<br/>
Candlesticks in the dark<br/>
I was whippin' it hard<br/>
I was gettin' the broads that like "who the hell is that"<br/>
I Was Dealing Sap<br/>
You Looking at a Nigga That Drove To Hell And Back<br/>
Charismatic I Was Raised By An Addict With Money In The Attic<br/>
Got Goons While You At It At This Present Time I'm Out Of My Mind And That's A Habit<br/>
Still Got Them Waiting In Line They Gotta Have<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: John Legend]</i><br/>
Last Night Was The First Night I Got Sleep<br/>
Tossing And Turning For Two Or Three Weeks<br/>
My Nightmares Are Triggered By Bad Memories<br/>
Lord, Send Me An Angel Right Now While I'm Having Ghetto Dreams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Cold sweats listenin' to the old sweat<br/>
One, two that's a ho check<br/>
Now for real, nigga this a whole check<br/>
Just bossin' around, polo sweats<br/>
Used to dream about a bigger couch<br/>
Woke up in a bigger house, c'mon<br/>
Commas in my bank account<br/>
So much money I had to let the banker count<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Scarface]</i><br/>
It's like the world stand still<br/>
Yesterday your little man got killed<br/>
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll<br/>
But he died too young kuz the game cold<br/>
Most niggas ain't know or they just think slow<br/>
Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though<br/>
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil<br/>
To the point down your ass when he see you<br/>
Let's take that needle, fill it with poison<br/>
Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia<br/>
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways<br/>
Ain't no honor among thieves?<br/>
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so<br/>
Because every criminal I know is in the clink, yo<br/>
A nigga in the game right now<br/>
Must be working for them people cause that shit played out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: John Legend]</i><br/>
I lay awake in my four corner room with the candles
