I think I may have to take it back to like to 10 years ago, you know<br/>
BIG MEECH ERA (you feel me?)<br/>
Real Real Motivation for a street nigga <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Pull up in all color Ferraris<br/>
Bitches in Tiaras<br/>
If you in here while im still here<br/>
Everybody else starving<br/>
Everybody else starring<br/>
Shawty got the Mclarian and I had the 7<br/>
<br/>
Pulled up at the Compound, clothes smelling like gun powder<br/>
Salute to the real niggas and real bitches who got they own bottles<br/>
I was snapping before fabo my raps come wit aHalo<br/>
Went out with Jeezy we spent pesos like J-bo<br/>
Took E’s to the 20 grand he got a pistol on him and 20 grand<br/>
A couple things I ain't glorifying is the kids dying and the mommas dying (Scarface)<br/>
Everybody need to calm down stand right by your homie side<br/>
Gunshots in this motherfucker turn this bitch into a homie-side (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Over a million sold they say I'm crossing over..<br/>
Oh yeah the club packed, I should’ve brought a rubber<br/>
My whole body inked, my family hardly know me<br/>
You know I put that work in just to get a Rollie (I did)<br/>
BIG MEECH ERA<br/>
Japanese Dinner<br/>
Trap in these denim (damn)<br/>
Ain't stuntin these women (naaa)<br/>
Wood Grain steering wheel I just might catch a splinter. <br/>
If this a flexing contest I think we found a winner<br/>
I think we found a winner<br/>
Pull up in some shorts middle of December<br/>
“Put this shit down, that shit, I can smell that moon rock “<br/>
I got to tell you how that shit started<br/>
<br/>
Trapping off the court on the back porch (I DID)<br/>
Had that pack ordered. We was back door. (We was nigga!)<br/>
That’s that good shit that’s that hood shit (WE HOOD)<br/>
You a cute bitch and your crew thick (I LIED)<br/>
Got a chopper on me the size of pool stick (this long)<br/>
With a blu davenchy, dog food bricks (Heroin)<br/>
Snowman on repeat, Rest In Peace Nando<br/>
I see Jigg in here I see Quazy too<br/>
When brawl witchu we send them bottles through we send the marters through<br/>
Im on the Carter 2<br/>
Like Tyrese was on the Marta too<br/>
They start calling too<br/>
They starting falling through<br/>
Got them chickens boy like a barb b q (tell em)<br/>
Talk to lame niggas something we hardly do<br/>
I sip the PJ bottle I rock the AP on them. (okay)<br/>
I think my rollie harder this an AG PARTY<br/>
<br/>
Over a million sold they say Im crossing over..<br/>
Oh yeah the club packed, I should’ve brought a rubber<br/>
My whole body inked, my family hardly know me<br/>
You know I put that work in just to get a Rollie (I did)<br/>
BIG MEECH ERA<br/>
Japanese Dinner<br/>
Trap in these denim (damn)<br/>
Ain't stuntin these women (naaa)<br/>
Wood Grain steering wheel I just might catch a splinter. <br/>
If this a flexing contest I think we found a winner<br/>
I think we found a winner<br/>
Pull up in some shorts middle of December<br/>
“Put this shit down, that shit, I can smell that moon rock “<br/>
I got to tell you how that shit started <i>[x2]</i>
