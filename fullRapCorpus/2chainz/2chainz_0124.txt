Yah! Tru<br/>
<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
If I know you, I'ma bless you<br/>
You my folks, I'ma bless you<br/>
If I love you, I'ma bless you<br/>
If I trust you, it's a blessing<br/>
If you flexin', then it's a blessing<br/>
And if they test you, then it's a blessing<br/>
<br/>
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes it look like the mall<br/>
In the back of my mind, I ball harder than y'all<br/>
I used to have an old school that I sat on some dubs<br/>
For the first time in my life, mama knew I sold drugs<br/>
There it was, hustlin' across the way<br/>
Went in on my first ounce with Big Shay<br/>
AG had orange, DC had white<br/>
Lil cuz got murked, you ain't seen that life<br/>
I done bought at least two chains more than twice<br/>
Count money from the night 'til the mornin' light<br/>
Had a convo with God, I told him, "Thank you, Lord<br/>
Cause everything that I've got, I'd like to thank you for"<br/>
<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
If I know you, I'ma bless you<br/>
You my folks, I'ma bless you<br/>
If I love you, I'ma bless you<br/>
If I trust you, it's a blessing<br/>
If you flexin', it's a blessing<br/>
And if they test you, it's a blessing<br/>
<br/>
My partner bought so much pussy, man they gave that boy a discount<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, ho I think I got a miscount<br/>
I've been runnin' through them rubber bands all day, ho<br/>
I've been runnin' through them rubber bands, I got paid so<br/>
I just dropped the top on the whip, I'm in fuego<br/>
I just poured a 4 in a mothafuckin' Faygo<br/>
Diamonds on my teeth, lick the clit, now it's shinin'<br/>
Ate a caesar salad, I dropped carats in my salad<br/>
Pinky ring, water wrist, water neck, frigid, yeah<br/>
Glasses vintage, car vintage, I'm about to get it, yeah<br/>
Pocket full of money, nothin' less than a 50, yeah<br/>
Smokin' on a zip, nothin' less than a hippy, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
If I know you, I'ma bless you<br/>
You my folks, I'ma bless you<br/>
If I love you, I'ma bless you<br/>
If I trust you, it's a blessing<br/>
If you flexin', it's a blessing<br/>
And if they test you, it's a blessing, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
If I know you, I'ma bless you<br/>
You my folks, I'ma bless you, yah, tru!<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing<br/>
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
