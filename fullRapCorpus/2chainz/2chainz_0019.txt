Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
<br/>
Niggas know I call my porsche the baby elephant<br/>
You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment<br/>
Everything I got I got from selling shit<br/>
And who I sold it to is irrelevant<br/>
Pocket full of Dead Presidents I'm With whatever<br/>
I pull my dick out and tell her sit whereever<br/>
I done stood on the block nigga from 9 to 9<br/>
And I sell a 9 at least 9 times<br/>
9Milla Clientel Look Like Thriller<br/>
If my baby mama cheating I Hope God with her<br/>
You not iler I'm Godzilla on hard liquor<br/>
My Penny loafers had nickels... UGH<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
That's my mother fucker word nigga<br/>
That's my word<br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
That's my mother fucker word nigga<br/>
That's my word<br/>
<br/>
I am slangin Chickens<br/>
I am slangin Hawks<br/>
I Take The 4 Up out of bricks bitch I can write in chalk<br/>
You know I know that white green like a chalk board<br/>
What you doin just chillin look like the top bored<br/>
So many chickens in the kitchen it looks like a soup<br/>
Must be some owls in this bitch cause I keep hearin WHO<br/>
This for my niggas cookin 9s like they chicken breast<br/>
You know we tryna hide the 6s that's why the chickens dressed<br/>
I Had the lam Black and green like a parkeet<br/>
You know I ain't tripping<br/>
50 pigeons in a cherokee<br/>
Everything a nigga got is from slanging birds<br/>
What I ain't get from slangin blocks I got from slanging words... SNOW<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
That's my mother fucker word nigga<br/>

Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
That's my mother fucker word nigga<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Yo Gotti:]</i><br/>
I got a Car that bitch is classy white on red<br/>
Inside out that bitch nasty<br/>
When I pull up on them 6s speakers blastin<br/>
Black scale white work clear plastic<br/>
And everything I got I got from sellin birds<br/>
Half a brick to do a verse I guess I am sellin words<br/>
That dubbed it up<br/>
Niggas send medranks so thadouble the cup<br/>
Got 2chainz bitch I'm icey as fuck<br/>
2brac on my arm that's a 100 and up<br/>
We sell dope it ain't none to us<br/>
New bitch new whip nigga change for what nigga change for<br/>
What and where I come from niggas bang for none<br/>
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for sum<br/>
Drinkin soda bakin soda I'm yammin up<br/>
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up<br/>
My niggas grinding we banding up<br/>
These pussies know not to be playin with us... WORK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Birdman:]</i><br/>
My bad bitch my money long<br/>
Car game filthy and my game strong<br/>
The kitchen hot<br/>
My block rock<br/>
My neighborhood shot cus them cars hot<br/>
Nigga on some money shit<br/>
Got back on that other shit<br/>
Came with the fame nigga listen while you learn BITCH<br/>
Money is for show shit<br/>
Gettin it while we blow this bitch<br/>
All the time we gonna shine while we flowin' bitch<br/>
100 thousand on this watch<br/>
Living lavish off top<br/>
Neighborhood watch<br/>
Cocaine flocks<br/>
The coke game strong<br/>
Overseas phone<br/>
Nigga made it home<br/>
So we gettin it on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
That's my mother fucker word nigga<br/>

Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds<br/>
That's my mother fucker word nigga<br/>
