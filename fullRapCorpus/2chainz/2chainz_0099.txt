<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Now that's crazy<br/>
Now that's hard Mike WiLL, that's hard<br/>
See I ain't see it like that, that's hard<br/>
You hard bruh<br/>
That's why, that's why we been friends for so long bruh<br/>
That's why I used to sneak you in the club bruh<br/>
Just for that reason right there bruh<br/>
Aight bruh, let me just freestyle some more, cause this shit<br/>
I'm smoking the LSD<br/>
And God dang, I got a little drink downstairs<br/>
I don't need it though, let's go<br/>
Let me just fuck with this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Told a bitch you motherfucking right<br/>
Told a bitch you motherfucking right<br/>
Told a bitch you motherfucking right<br/>
Told a bitch you motherfucking right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Mike told me this gon be your favorite song<br/>
Ooh, wear that red one, that my favorite thong<br/>
Put em on, I said baby put em on<br/>
I said what you gonna do when you go home?<br/>
Kiss your man after you sucked on my woo!<br/>
She called my phone, I told her I was at the store<br/>
Last name Chainz, first name 2<br/>
Pull up on me, shawty you know what to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I bought some gold chains with my drug money<br/>
Then wore it on the stage just to stunt on 'em<br/>
That's how we do it on the south side<br/>
Might buy an AK using all 5's<br/>
Pittsburgh, zone 6, zone trey<br/>
Zone 1, do this shit like every day<br/>
Old, copy roll, camera roll<br/>
24's got the Wraith pigeon toed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Gas station, re-up on the petrol<br/>
Hit the trap and re-up on the petrol<br/>
Shit, by the time you get it it's a retro<br/>
Shit, used to have a job outside of Citgo<br/>
Shit, by the time you get it I'll be peww nigga<br/>
Yeah I been a player since the womb nigga<br/>
OG Kush is my perfume nigga<br/>
Ice on my wrist, I got my mind right<br/>
Riding down the street with the Klon-dykes<br/>
Two black hoes, white one in the middle<br/>
I'm getting to the S with two lines in the middle<br/>
Got a bankroll that'll make it whip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
