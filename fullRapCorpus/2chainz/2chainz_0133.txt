Y'all niggas lame for that, y'all niggas lame for that<br/>
Shoot a man in his back, should be ashamed of that<br/>
Young niggas banging back, young nigga banging back<br/>
Then we gon' fade to black then we gon' fade to black<br/>
<br/>
I left the crib walking, drove a Mercedes back<br/>
You wasn't blessed with ambition so who you gon blame for that<br/>
Tried to get off the Act, still didn't know how to act<br/>
Still pull up in the back, sit my ass right in the back<br/>
Tell my driver when he open my door to take off his hat<br/>
Double saran everything so that you know its a wrap<br/>
Double salute anybody that made it out the trap<br/>
Some of y'all probably still owe me from back<br/>
In the back in the back in the back in the back<br/>
I had that work right in front of me fuck all you niggas you wannabes<br/>
Most of you niggas is under mes, I'ma give ya ass some to see<br/>
My car don't have car keys, my crib got palm trees<br/>
Pussy smell like sardine you, need to get up of my lawn please<br/>
This a real nigga conversation, real nigga demonstration real niggas<br/>
No crystal or hilfigers, a bunch of ignorant lil' niggas<br/>
A bunch of red young tenders, dark skin queens, Puerto Rican princess's<br/>
Scratch my hand my palms itching, hit the dope start twitching<br/>
This a new kinda kitchen, marble countertops, see through fridge<br/>
3 thousand for the microwave, touchscreen stove lil bitch!<br/>
Please don't make me relapse, make me start back trappin<br/>
Everybody in the city, saying that boy Tity done started back snapping<br/>
<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
Tell her let's go have a bite, tell her let's go have a bite<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I sat in the trap no one cooked at night, I treat my third stripe like its Kryptonite<br/>
I stopped serving sacks over qualified, have you ever seen a homicide?<br/>
Have you ever seen ya partna die? Have you ever been traumatized<br/>
Even at graduation I had a bookbag full of yams, tryna multiply<br/>
Enough of the negative actions, I got my paycheck off passion<br/>
I'm wearing 4 bracelets for fashion, don't think its a race when I pass you<br/>
Stop talking that mafia shit, you never met Meech, J-bo or Illz<br/>
Luda charged me just to dip, was there when Chaka was swung on by Tip<br/>
I'm like oh shit we goon tear up this bitch, pull out a stick when you put up your fist<br/>
I'm like these niggas done fucked up my fit, funny how heaven and hell co exist<br/>
Funny how life can put you in the mix, I sold the pounds and go hustle the bricks<br/>
I booked studio with the trap money, Lil Wayne used to come get the bags from me<br/>
You still asking niggas for gas money, I look at these rappers like crash dummies<br/>
I look at these bitches that fuck with these rappers like bitch you just fucked with my last homie<br/>
Kesha can come get the last from me, Heaven can come get the last from me<br/>
Harmony can come get the last from me, Halo can come get the last from me MAMA!<br/>
<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
Tell her let's go have a bite, tell her let's go have a bite<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah<br/>
Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah
