Talking met the blue swang<br/>
Gamble up my loose chains<br/>
2 chains, 'nough said, throw money at her forehead<br/>
This about it, wait a minute, think about it<br/>
Her pussy so wet, it look like she waste some drinks around it<br/>
Best in Atlanta, you really don't have to think about it<br/>
A nigger so cold, my microphone got one <i>[?]</i><br/>
Titty 2 chains and the 2 <i>[?]</i> I'm doubla illa<br/>
2 hands on my balls nigger call it double dribble, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Think about it, now think about it<br/>
Think about it, yeah think about it<br/>
Just think about it, think about it<br/>
Just think about it, think about it<br/>
<br/>
Just think about the <i>[?]</i>. Y'all know the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Used to sell them bags, now I'm selling swag<br/>
Tell your bitch come here, tell your bitch come here<br/>
I only have time for one night, you can have her back when I deal<br/>
Smoke hammer bagging all real, take another pull and I steal<br/>
I'm with my crew <i>[?]</i> like we walking around on stills<br/>
Walking around on blimps, and we pushing weight<br/>
Got my pocket looking built<br/>
<i>[?]</i> yeah, picture that, take a picture<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I come to your city real soon and watch them titties shake<br/>
Anyways, I <i>[?]</i> I'm really good at math so I know that don't mean penetrate<br/>
I'm coming out the <i>[?]</i> nigger know this if you do not know anything<br/>
2 chain stay down like tennis shoes<br/>
I need a mill, wanna go to dinner soon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Think about it, now think about it<br/>
Think about it, yeah think about it<br/>
Just think about it, think about it<br/>
Just think about it, think about it.
