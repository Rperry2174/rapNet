<i>[Hook: T-Pain]</i><br/>
Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby<br/>
Cause the relationship has been so good lately<br/>
If I don’t do what I do, then who’s gon put food on the table?<br/>
It is what it is, I’m just handling biz<br/>
But I do what I do so we can live<br/>
I only do what I do so we can live<br/>
I only do what I do so we can live<br/>
I only do what I do so we can live<br/>
I only do what I do so we can live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Mama don’t work, heater don’t work<br/>
Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt<br/>
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness<br/>
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence<br/>
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it<br/>
I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence<br/>
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”<br/>
He asked me when the last time I smoke, I said a while ago<br/>
Forgive me officer, I’m stressin’ and my pockets sore<br/>
Hurtin’, chillin’ with my dog like a fuckin’ Labrador<br/>
He said he ain’t with the bull: matador<br/>
Looked at the top of my car, like what this lighter for?<br/>
I told him I was puttin’ girls up in the mornin’<br/>
And I’m goin’ to my uncle’s house to see if he can join me<br/>
The officer got a call so he was needed<br/>
And he told me slow it down, and I told him please believe it<br/>
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle’s house<br/>
Well it really wasn’t my uncle, it was a junkie’s house<br/>
He got a badass niece with a donkey now<br/>
Pullin’ out the parking lot, headed to the other spot<br/>
Out all night, addict with addicts, causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy<br/>
Niggas know we Mobbin’ Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep<br/>
The good die young, and promises are hard to keep<br/>
I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak<br/>
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week<br/>
The girl that I’m with is like a young Kimora Lee<br/>
I got them folks fiendin’, pumpin’ that Jodeci<br/>
Sippin’ and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat<br/>
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys<br/>
Conduct disorderly, stayin’ in the trap house<br/>
Trips went to work, I’m so glad that it mapped out<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Simon says, monkey see monkey do<br/>
I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too<br/>
See me with my bitch, you buy your bitch the same purse<br/>
Shoot you and your nigga, y’all can share the same hearse<br/>
This that murder 1, mixed with the bubblegum<br/>
Kept working my dun dun duns, come get your mama some<br/>
Nigga, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums<br/>
I rarely finish the end of my words<br/>
Watch the rims hit on the curve<br/>
And what a nigga really care about a lisp?<br/>
People arguin’ over me while I’m layin’ in a bitch<br/>
Death to a snitch, get it while you can (break) and shit<br/>
Its 3:30 in the A.M.<br/>
We’re just gettin’ started like when I had the van<br/>
Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass<br/>
Your style good enough to put in a glass bag<br/>
You know I’m getting’ mine, you should use a hashtag<br/>
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses<br/>
Just killed her pussy, you gon’ have to use forensics<br/>
Organized crime, you can put me in a lineup<br/>
Plus I got dreads, I’ll pay a hundred for the line up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Appetite for destruction, and I don’t a menu<br/>
So far ahead of y’all niggas, I can see you in my rearview<br/>
See you in my rearview one of your headlights out nigga<br/>
I just got my first R&amp;B bitch and got head all night with her<br/>
She said she tired of the generic<br/>
I say what up, she say what up, what up, you a parrot?<br/>
I’m like “Bird ass girl, aren’t you sick of the rhetoric?”<br/>
And if I ain’t arrogant, I’m out of my element
