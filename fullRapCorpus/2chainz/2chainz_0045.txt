<i>[Intro: Pharrell &amp; 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Tomorrow, tomorrow<br/>
Tomorrow, tomorrow<br/>
Ain't no such thing as tomorrow<br/>
The way we living today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Dreads hang on designer everything Mr. Comme des Gar√ßons, Mr. Alexander Wang<br/>
Mr. Chain, pinky ring, flow insane, ho insane<br/>
Man, these shoes I got on these are hardest I've done seen<br/>
It look clean where you pour I remix it make it dirty<br/>
If she got good head and text me I text back and tell her "hurry"<br/>
It's that category 5 when I walk up in the strip club<br/>
Throw it high, make you and George Washington head butt<br/>
OG's never fed us, now young niggas fed up<br/>
Ballin' so hard I deserve a and one<br/>
Baking Soda marketing, I'm getting it ain't I? Obviously.<br/>
You a bitch, you a ho, that's just my philosophy<br/>
And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team<br/>
Billie Jean red leather same color red lobster<br/>
And she brain wash ya, head doctor<br/>
I be fresh as hell if the Feds watching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: 2 Chainz &amp; Pharrell]</i><br/>
I'm a be fresh as hell if the Feds watching<br/>
I'm a be fresh as hell if the Feds watching<br/>
I'm a be fresh as hell if the Feds watching<br/>
Drop top, head bobbing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Grams to Grammy's, two guns Yosemite<br/>
Niggas put their Glock on your ass, fuck that Heather B<br/>
Pumping that amphetamine, all this D I'm peddling<br/>
I be somewhere settling, somewhere that you have never been<br/>
To the top you never been, you might need a respirator<br/>
Money on the rise like I'm counting on a elevator<br/>
You gon' need a detonator swimming with them barracudas<br/>
Put the rocket on that motherfuckin prosecutor<br/>
This Armani, this Givenchy, I parachute you<br/>
I'm so fly I jumped out the air wearin Gucci (Tell 'em!)<br/>
I'm raw, talking California Rolls<br/>
Smoking California weed with California hoes (Truu!)<br/>
Sending flicks to my partners in the state pen<br/>
I just got some pants made out off snake skin<br/>
See them shades you got on call Ray-Bans<br/>
And the shades I got on cost eight band (damn)<br/>
<br/>
