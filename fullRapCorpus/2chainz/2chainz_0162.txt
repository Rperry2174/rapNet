If Puerto Rico wasn't gone he would be right here with me<br/>
If True wasn't gone he would be right here with me<br/>
Rest in peace to my niggas from my block<br/>
And free all my niggas tryna get some guap<br/>
I'm screamin' "Free <i>[?]</i> " till he come home<br/>
My nigga locked up with a smartphone<br/>
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone<br/>
We some street niggas, we got next, bitch<br/>
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch<br/>
Yeah, understand, yeah, bust it down<br/>
I wanna see you dance bitch, bust it down<br/>
I ain't playin', hundred grand bitch, bust it down<br/>
<br/>
I'm on a beast too, Gucci my feet too<br/>
Fuck around and buy a mink<br/>
I got Cuban on my links<br/>
I might pull up in a Brinks<br/>
On some rims and some tings<br/>
Give a fuck about you tings, think, 'bout<br/>
I'm in a big clean car<br/>
Dope in the sixteen bars<br/>
Recited by yours truly<br/>
Fuck that bitch playin' Gucci<br/>
That's ratchet as fuck<br/>
I told her "back it on up"<br/>
My jacket matching the truck<br/>
I got back in the <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
My nigga locked up with a smartphone<br/>
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone<br/>
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch<br/>
Bought a necklace just to flex, bitch<br/>
My nigga locked up with a smartphone<br/>
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone<br/>
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch<br/>
Bought a necklace just to flex, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Uh, uh, partner got a Android<br/>
Dippin', dappin', payin' for it<br/>
Extra year in the can for it<br/>
Concrete damn floor<br/>
Dancin' with the devil<br/>
Tryna leave the ghetto<br/>
Going state or federal<br/>
I Golden State the schedule<br/>
Gold rose petals<br/>
Out of the alphabet, G is my favorite letter<br/>
I gotta make it better, cover the incidentals<br/>
<i>[?]</i> a killer, as long as the Lincoln Continental<br/>
The lawyers will be here any minute<br/>
Used to have commas, now I'm sentenced<br/>
Wrist in the bowl bought a Bentley<br/>
It got a hole in the ceiling<br/>
Partner in the hole for a metro, I think it's silly<br/>
Shawty sucked mine so damn long, I got a hickey<br/>
She know she prettier than Ricky<br/>
She step in blood when she walk<br/>
You know them rich niggas in prison<br/>
Try to FaceTime ya and talk<br/>
This is the greatest of all, don't want no haters involved<br/>
Hold up, I'm taking this call<br/>
(Need that chain when I get out, player)<br/>
<br/>
My nigga locked up with a smartphone<br/>
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone<br/>
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch<br/>
Bought a necklace just to flex, bitch<br/>
My nigga locked up with a smartphone<br/>
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone<br/>
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch<br/>
Bought a necklace just to flex, bitch<br/>
<br/>
I'm good, I'm killin' niggas, you know that<br/>
That motherfucker <i>[?]</i> ain't he, what the hell y'all doin'<br/>
(Mumbled talking)<br/>
Can ya hear me boy?<br/>
(Mumbled talking)<br/>
Call me when you get some service so I can holla at you bruh<br/>
Okay cool man, like later on tonight I'm a have good service (Mumbling) Can you hear me?<br/>
Yeah, I'll be- I'll be up that's my time to move. Call me 'round that time<br/>
Okay cool, I'll hit you 'round that time then<br/>
