<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
So many watches, I need a time capsule<br/>
Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel<br/>
Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel<br/>
In my muscle car, maybe we should arm wrestle<br/>
I'm raw, using all caps<br/>
I got A on my ballcaps<br/>
No, I didn't do it but I thought about it<br/>
If I would have did it, it would have chalk around<br/>
Yellow tape, never hesitate<br/>
2 Chainz derived from Section 8<br/>
Meditate, that's my stress relief<br/>
I've been stylin' on 'em, since a lease, preach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz x2]</i><br/>
Live long enough, it'll happen to you<br/>
Live long<br/>
It will, it will<br/>
It will, it will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
My pop' told me men don't cry<br/>
Then he turned around and died on me<br/>
So I didn't know what else to do<br/>
But motherfuckin' cry, homie<br/>
Oh yeah, I'm God's son<br/>
Tell Nas he got more than one<br/>
And me, I got more to see, more to be<br/>
Order three, started with a quarter ki'<br/>
I'm so ill I need penicill'<br/>
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will<br/>
And these days you can't tell who is really real<br/>
Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]</i><br/>
Streets love a nigga, got a D-boy membership<br/>
We do it from the heart, I hope the aunt will remember this<br/>
Coke on all sinisters, cold but no fridge in this<br/>
No to all witnesses, lie or die infamous<br/>
My style is so infamous, my style, it needs censorship<br/>
Dealer what's the business? Don't call <i>[?]</i><br/>
Unless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some benjamins<br/>
Niggas say a lie on their way to the top<br/>
But you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops<br/>
I guess that's sayin' a lot<br/>
But we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Pusha T]</i><br/>
Death over dynasty, I'm talkin' major, not the minor league<br/>
And you the last of a dyin' breed<br/>
Follow caine like a menace to society<br/>
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me<br/>
My shampoo days done showed me the way<br/>
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague<br/>
How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'<br/>
Your niggas got rich, but when you died them niggas owed you<br/>
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me<br/>
I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself<br/>
I'm scramblin', still hard to hold the tears back<br/>
Never saw what I became, can't get them years back<br/>
Death before dishonor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz x2]</i>
