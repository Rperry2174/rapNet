<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Lights out, countdown<br/>
Want you to take it off, right now<br/>
This the countdown<br/>
About to where you out<br/>
Just wanna get up in like, yeah<br/>
Lights out, countdown<br/>
Want you to take it off, right now<br/>
This the countdown<br/>
About to where you out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Lights out, take your shirt off<br/>
My phone ringing for some work, bird call<br/>
Then I take your girl, and swerve off<br/>
Drop it in, load off<br/>
Facial expression, it started off with a text and<br/>
The texting ended up special<br/>
And now you next to a blessing<br/>
It's me, especially when I'm looking in your direction<br/>
If love is a drug then I'm arrested for your possestion<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
24/7, 365 on them inner thighs<br/>
I memorize what I did when I'm inside<br/>
That in and out, that up and down<br/>
That side to side<br/>
I spray paint them walls, I vandalize<br/>
Crab legs by candle light<br/>
I break'em open, like I break you open<br/>
Break you off, countdown, I'm taking off<br/>
You a hard worker baby, knew you shouldn't date a boss<br/>
5-4-3-2-1, I'm taking off<br/>
Gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Please don't make it easy<br/>
Cause I'm a want you<br/>
All night<br/>
And you got something to teach me<br/>
And baby when I get it, I'm a get in it<br/>
And make love, love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
