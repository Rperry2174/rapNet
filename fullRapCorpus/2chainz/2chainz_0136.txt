<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
(M-M-M-Murda)<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Damn right, bro<br/>
<br/>
4 AM, I'm just gettin' started<br/>
For my birthday I threw me a surprise party<br/>
Reminiscin' 'bout the trap, playin' the first Carter<br/>
My life changed when I had my first daughter<br/>
Got my first quarter flippin' fifty-dollar slabs<br/>
My nigga lookin' at the bills, askin' you for half<br/>
Cut from a different cloth, take pride in results<br/>
Anytime she wanna dip I'm providin' the sauce<br/>
You on side of the boss, so you kind of the boss<br/>
You keep playin' with me, I end up signing your boss<br/>
Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga<br/>
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas<br/>
Ride with Champagne P<br/>
If it wasn't for the struggle then I wouldn't be me<br/>
Call me Deuce or Dos, anything but broke<br/>
Got my aim from the scope, got the game by the throat, damn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (yeah, yeah)<br/>
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (straight up)<br/>
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (its lit)<br/>
Hit the lights (yeah), I'm way over top<br/>
Pop it, flick it<br/>
Drop a pin, send a location (skrrt, skrrt)<br/>
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship (skrrt, skrrt)<br/>
Drop off a bag of some dangerous (yeah)<br/>
I'ma hit you, 4 AM, see if you make it (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I dropped ColleGrove out the sky, ooh<br/>
In a group with the best rapper that's alive, ooh<br/>
Never turn my back on my slime, ooh<br/>
I ain't wanna fuck the bitch but she was fine, ooh<br/>
Hold up baby, let me take my time, ooh<br/>
Hard to get some head and try to drive, ooh<br/>
Jumpin' out the cake and that's surprisin', ooh<br/>
Pickin' up the duffel bag like exercisin', ooh<br/>
Bought mama new house 'cause she deserve it, ooh<br/>
Practice makes perfect but nobody's perfect, ooh<br/>
Escobar is not open for service, ooh<br/>
Send you to doctor Miami for your surgery, ooh<br/>
<br/>

<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Ooh, Riccardo Tisci on the crewneck<br/>
Ooh, On a killin' rapper spree and nigga, you next<br/>
Ooh, they talkin', chillin', watchin' Netflix<br/>
Ooh, I used to trap and watch bootlegs<br/>
Ooh, I'm on my wave like a durag<br/>
Ooh, I see your boo, now where your crew at?<br/>
Ooh, talkin' tequila for the pipe-up<br/>
Ooh, I hope you got a clean vagina, yeah<br/>
Drench God, drench God, really<br/>
Represent and we the squad, really<br/>
Tec got the Rollie, now I get it<br/>
I used to sell drugs for a living<br/>
Got me a job sellin' records<br/>
Had to use the jeweler for a reference<br/>
Might buy a truck with the extra<br/>
Might use the legs for a necklace<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Don't stop trappin', boy<br/>
Got 'bout twelve racks this mornin'<br/>
Got 'bout twelve racks<br/>
Started last night, still goin'<br/>
Twelve racks strong<br/>
Got the pitbull in the corner, she pregnant<br/>
Got the crackhead in the corner, she pregnant<br/>
Everybody in here pregnant, 'cept my partner and them<br/>
But we gettin' this money though, I'm tellin' you that
