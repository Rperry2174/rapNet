Yeah, turn that maafaka up Nolan<br/>
Woah, know what I'm saying, I wanna feel like I was in some muthafakin' danger<br/>
I got my mothafuckin' pistol in my pocket, ya dig?<br/>
Yeah, in the booth, on some 5540 old national shit, you know what it is, nigga<br/>
We in the back, nigga, way in the back, nigga, serving sacks, nigga and serving Act<br/>
Mane, c'mon with the Kap, bruh...<br/>
<br/>
Riverdale, he was there, she was there, you wasn't there<br/>
I was the same ol' nigga<br/>
Yeah that trap had raised a nigga<br/>
How could you blame a nigga?<br/>
Gold everywhere, gold over there, Trinidad James you niggas<br/>
Came on the set with hundreds to bet<br/>
But I still changed you niggas, yeah<br/>
<br/>
My first foreign car, it was a Bimmer<br/>
My second foreign car, it was a Bimmer<br/>
My third foreign car, it was a Porsche<br/>
My fourth foreign car you can't afford<br/>
My pocket pregnant, don't want no abortion<br/>
My draws got them horses, my car got them horses<br/>
Rocking some Pradas like they was Air Forces<br/>
We had no choices<br/>
<br/>
Riverdale, he was there, she was there, you wasn't there<br/>
I was the same ol' nigga<br/>
Yeah that trap had raised a nigga<br/>
How could you blame a nigga?<br/>
Gold everywhere, gold over there, Trinidad James you niggas<br/>
Came on the set with hundreds to bet<br/>
But I still changed you niggas, yeah<br/>
<br/>
You wasn't there when mama was struggling<br/>
You wasn't there when mama was fussing<br/>
Told 'em ketchup, you too far in the mustard<br/>
I had a Chevelle and wanted a Cutlass<br/>
I went to work and I made an abundance<br/>
Gucci flip flops with the corns and bunions<br/>
Counting blue hundreds and smoking an onion<br/>
And she got an onion and I wanna rub it<br/>
We hanging off the Nat, see that's where my office at<br/>
We dressed all in black<br/>
We got 'em calling back, just went to the mall and back<br/>
When you was the quarterback, I had the quarter sacks<br/>
<br/>
Riverdale, Riverdale, Riverdale, Riverdale, Riverdale<br/>
Riverdale Rd., nigga<br/>
He was there, he was there, you weren't there<br/>
He was there, she was there<br/>
Riverdale Rd., nigga<br/>
Abracadabra, I turned myself into a millionaire<br/>
I wore some Gucci to your mama house just to leave it there<br/>
<br/>
Riverdale, he was there, she was there, you wasn't there<br/>
I was the same ol' nigga<br/>
Yeah that trap had raised a nigga<br/>
How could you blame a nigga?<br/>
Gold everywhere, gold over there, Trinidad James you niggas<br/>
Came on the set with hundreds to bet<br/>
But I still changed you niggas, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I know something you don't know<br/>
I'm gonna get some bands, yeah<br/>
I know something you don't know, yeah<br/>
I'm gonna get some bands<br/>
<br/>
Okay, from grams to Grammys<br/>
Okay, from fans to family<br/>
I went from trips we tryna plan<br/>
To cribs in South Miami<br/>
They got my vision fancy<br/>
She in my crib, no panties<br/>
I told the bitch she got to sit down<br/>
Just to understand me<br/>
They asking, "What's the plan, B?"<br/>
I don't have a Plan B<br/>
I told 'em this shit got to work<br/>
It's just like candy to me<br/>
I mean it's hard but it's sweet<br/>
I'm Drench God in the streets<br/>
I break the law in the sheets<br/>
I make her cum on repeat<br/>
<br/>
I know something you don't know<br/>
I'm gonna get some bands, oh yeah<br/>
I know something you don't know, yeah<br/>
I'm gonna get some bands<br/>
Riverdale, Riverdale!
