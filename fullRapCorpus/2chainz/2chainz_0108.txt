<i>[Verse 1 – 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
You did it for the broads, I did it for the paper<br/>
Got a hundred styles, got a hundred acres<br/>
Fuck the police (fuck 'em), hundred middle fingers (fuck 'em)<br/>
And you a square nigga (fuck 'em), you a chess table (fuck 'em)<br/>
You be savin' hoes (fuck 'em), you be rest haven (fuck 'em)<br/>
Got a lotta rides like a bus station<br/>
See my phone ringin', see my diamonds danglin'<br/>
See the bitches blinkin', blue c-notes,<br/>
All of 'em singing, blue c-notes<br/>
All of 'em Franklins, blue c-notes<br/>
Spend without thinkin', a tool without safety<br/>
I have ya broads taken, I have they heart achin'<br/>
Push start crankin', new grill face it<br/>
New mill tastin', straight without a chaser<br/>
Draws come from Macy's, broads is confirmation<br/>
Same in different places, I run all the bases<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You did it for the broads, I did it for the paper<br/>
I got a hundred styles, got a hundred flavors,<br/>
Fuck the police, hundred middle fingers,<br/>
And you a square nigga, blue c-notes<br/>
All of 'em singin', blue c-notes<br/>
All of 'em Franklins, blue c-notes<br/>
Spend without thinkin', ice on both pinkies<br/>
Mobile phone ringin', blue c-notes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 – Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I did it for my dogs, I did for the skaters<br/>
I did it for the paper, my niggas still on papers<br/>
I got a hundred tats, I got a hundred million<br/>
I keep on switchin' wifeys, you gotta Uncle Phil me<br/>
Dreadlock Rasta, hair like pasta<br/>
I don't see what's your problem, I need an eye doctor<br/>
Flying to them dollars, ducking fly swatters<br/>
Shoot 'em in the head, leave his mind boggled<br/>
Comin' down the boulevard I'm on your avenue<br/>
A half a mill on my grill, you niggas snaggle tooth<br/>
Told some dead presidents I'm finna bury you<br/>
When it come to presidents I like 'em black and blue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You did it for the broads, I did it for the paper<br/>
I got a hundred styles, got a hundred flavors,<br/>
Fuck the police, hundred middle fingers,<br/>
And you a square nigga, blue c-notes<br/>
All of 'em singin', blue c-notes<br/>
All of 'em Franklins, blue c-notes<br/>
Spend without thinkin', ice on both pinkies<br/>
Mobile phone ringin', blue c-notes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Got a hundred styles, got a hundred acres<br/>
Got a hundred tats, got a hundred skaters<br/>
Did it for the broads, I did it for the paper<br/>
I'm 'bout to buy a hog, bring in home the bacon
