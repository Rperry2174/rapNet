I wouldn't even...<br/>
I wouldn't even be here without that mothafuckin' door<br/>
We doing numbers, holmes<br/>
5540, we doing numbers, holmes<br/>
You can look that shit up, you can research that shit<br/>
<br/>
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
<br/>
No doorbell, we had the cameras included<br/>
No hibachi, all we had is some tuna fish<br/>
Moved up a level, then I stepped up my grind<br/>
Got to the top, ain't nobody around<br/>
When I look down, all I see is some sucka shit<br/>
And I'ma run shit, I put that on my bucket list<br/>
Adidas streetball, all the foreigns with the straps<br/>
Before the dreadlocks, I had the cornrows to the back<br/>
Used to sit on a broke down Camaro with packs<br/>
Told her, "Turn around," even though she had his name tatted<br/>
That's the way that it was, had a way with the girls<br/>
Had a felony before you knew what a felony was<br/>
You was taking the shots, you was feeling the buzz<br/>
Got so much in the stash spot, I could fill up a bus<br/>
Got gorillas with us, got chinchillas with us<br/>
No pretenders with us, got the winners with us, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
<br/>
Somebody watching the front door<br/>
Yeah I went to college and sold dope<br/>
Sold narcotics, a boat load<br/>
And all us felons and can't vote<br/>
Yeah I'm from the cut, I'm cutthroat<br/>
All up in the crowd, Frank Lucas fur coat<br/>
Yeah, sipping muddy like a mothafuckin' Merlot<br/>
Under the influence, I stayed on the first floor, first floor<br/>
Wait, first 48, hard to see my face, diamonds in the way<br/>
This is MMA, I just beat the case<br/>
In and out the nail salon, she got her nails polished<br/>
Turn up in tennis shoes, turn up in red bottoms<br/>
Turn up in red bottoms, turn up, turn up in red bottoms<br/>
She turn up in red bottoms, yeah what?<br/>
A nigga a hustler, now the feds got him<br/>
You bring the rubber bands, I bring the money counter<br/>
<br/>
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging<br/>
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
