It's going down if I say so<br/>
I come to raise hell, call me Halo<br/>
I'm growing up<br/>
I'll be out in a couple months<br/>
See right now I'm hanging out in my mama front<br/>
Oh dad, I heard you used to like sports, yeah?<br/>
Used to keep money in a sports bag<br/>
Heaven said you ain't be home in some weeks, nigga<br/>
Don't go starting that shit with me, nigga<br/>
By the time I get bigger I need a father figure<br/>
Someone to lean on<br/>
Sipping lean with your team, <i>[?]</i> big screen on you<br/>
You looking like a fiend, ho<br/>
You rap about triple beams only<br/>
In every argument you try to make my mama seem wrong<br/>
Fuck you, nigga<br/>
<br/>
And Harmony know I'm coming<br/>
She would no longer be the youngest<br/>
She keep kicking mama in the stomach<br/>
I'm gon kick your ass when I get there<br/>
You know sibling rivalry, it's all love<br/>
We'll all fight and then all hug<br/>
Like damn daddy got a ball court<br/>
I'm like damn daddy got a four wheeler<br/>
Damn daddy got a sports car<br/>
Damn daddy been wanting a lil nigga<br/>
We got enough land to find Sasquatch<br/>
Damn mommy, daddy making money<br/>
What the hell you complaining about?<br/>
So what if he was fucking with girls<br/>
As long as he don't even bring them hoes to the house<br/>
Heaven straight, Harmony cool<br/>
I can't wait to get my own room<br/>
I can't wait till home room<br/>
I can't wait I'll be home soon like<br/>
I can't wait to meet them, can't wait to meet them<br/>
I gotta hug now mom<br/>
Gotta hug GGG, get babysitted by nanna
