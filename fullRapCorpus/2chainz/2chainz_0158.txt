<i>[Intro - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Tunechi and 2 Chainz<br/>
Tunechi and 2 Chainz<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Told a bitch you mothafucking right<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Mike told me this gon be your favorite song<br/>
Ooh, wear that red one, that my favorite thong<br/>
Put em on, I said baby put em on<br/>
I said what you gonna do when you go home?<br/>
Kiss your man after you sucked on my woo!<br/>
She called my phone, I told her I was at the stu<br/>
Last name Chainz, first name 2<br/>
Pull up on me, shawty you know what to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I bought some gold chains with my drug money<br/>
Then wore it on the stage just to stunt on em<br/>
That's how we do it on the south side<br/>
Might buy an AK using all 5s<br/>
Big booty bitches in my archives<br/>
Potato on the barrel for you small fries<br/>
G4, G5 jet<br/>
Export, import checks on deck<br/>
Once the DJ drop this shit<br/>
Make em shake it like Tourette's<br/>
Smoking on the top floor, I'm as high as I can get<br/>
Lean in the baby bottle, I try not to babysit<br/>
So I had to take a sip, if I like it then I buy<br/>
Got so many damn rides I put my garage on a diet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
ColleGrove, we out here, all these bitches want this dope dick<br/>
And our pockets look like blowfish and we higher than some voltage<br/>
I got Trukfit on my back, bitch on this Actavis I'm active<br/>
And my acronym is HB, that's for Hot Boy, you a has been<br/>
All this bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, you ain't gang, gang, gang, gang, gang<br/>
You ain't squad, squad, squad, squad, squad you ain't hot like Haagen-Dazs<br/>
Out here thrashing with my crew, all you hearing is, Soo woo!<br/>
From New Orleans, that's voodoo got a baby with New-New<br/>
And I'm smoking like Badu hoodie loccing, I'm Piru<br/>
No more YMCMB, hocus pocus, bye bye, poof<br/>
Bitch you mothafucking right, get a mothafucking life<br/>
Lil Tunechi out this bitch, drops the mothafucking mic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
ColleGrove<br/>
ColleGrove<br/>
ColleGrove<br/>
ColleGrove<br/>
Tunechi and 2 Chainz<br/>
Tunechi and 2 Chainz<br/>
College Park, Holly Grove, ColleGrove the new name<br/>
Yeah it's Tunechi and 2 Chainz<br/>
