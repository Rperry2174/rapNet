I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I'm smoking on exotic my girl ain't got no stomach<br/>
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred<br/>
I asked her if she workin, she asked me do I want it<br/>
I said when I went to school bitch money was the subject<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm riding round my side of town<br/>
Boxin gloves, I beat the trial<br/>
I had a coke, I had a smile<br/>
I had a coat for every style, crocodile the gator type<br/>
I'm allergic to the hater type, I'll take your wife, give her back<br/>
Nine months after that, similac<br/>
Similar to saying mama's baby's daddy maybe<br/>
When we had sex I was in the Mercedes<br/>
And I ain't crazy but if that's my baby<br/>
Then we gonna have to name the lil' baby Mercedes<br/>
The money that I'm makin I don't see it like I'm blind<br/>
I rather spend money baby I don't spend time<br/>
My pocket's on full and so is my gas tank<br/>
And all my cars got gas in the ash tray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Photo-ready, my polo out the cleaners<br/>
I'm the perfect definition of something you've never seen<br/>
Maserati, Kawasaki, bought my girl a Beemer<br/>
The jewelry I got on is matching with the tequila<br/>
Patron margaritas, double for my diva's<br/>
I bring all my guns to work Gilbert Arenus<br/>
Plus I'm killin' features and I'm killin shows<br/>
I should have sex in a coffin 'cause I'm killin these hoes<br/>
Filling these goals, climbing up the ladder<br/>
Shoot your ass down you know I rep Atlanta, southside<br/>
I'm ridin around stuntin, smoking loud in public<br/>
Talking loud in public yeah my entourage is bucking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, I'm riding round I'm gettin it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it<br/>
I'm riding round I'm gettin it
