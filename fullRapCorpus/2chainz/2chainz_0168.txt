<i>[Verse 1: Reek Da Villain]</i><br/>
Aye yo weak minded bitches fall victim because my charm's strong jazzy pair of louis on my feet Chewy Armstrong<br/>
Ma couldn't be my cheerleader with platinum pom-poms she the type to misrepresent a king like Lebron's mom<br/>
Beating on my chest with a crown King Kong Don Langston Hughes I write a poem that do the Bible psalms harm<br/>
These other rappers want problems then bring it on umm this rapping beef is nothing my studio's in it's long form and all cowards'll become victims of man<br/>
Keep a 5th of Remy and a stick of piff in my hand yeh they fly but I'm a pilot that no one can understand plus the way I go ham'll make a Muslim say damn<br/>
Hustle hard trips to Miami for three days so I can meet with the connects and get the D Wade run up in the Gucci store and drop 3k you bum I could get your whole outfit out of BJ's<br/>
Lyrical scientist leaving mics with psoriasis so it's {bleeped} as Michael Myer's psychiatrist pyrics suppliacist who being lying stiff when the iron spits I come alone just me and one 9 Johnny {Unitis}<br/>
And let my bitch serenade through these slums and blow so much loud I need a hearing aid for my lungs<br/>
And as far as metaphors rate this I was a snail 'til haters threw salt on me and I dissolved into greatness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop. Hair weave killa I'll show up to your funeral<br/>
All this work I need a cubicle. Clear coat cuticle. Different color diamonds like a rubrics cube<br/>
If this was New Edition, I'll be Bobby Brown. Put the check over your head and call it Nike Town<br/>
How could I be down? Free Boosie, wipe me down. My credit card is black and proud<br/>
I've been trapping since roxies had the ankles out. I'm going to the money and I took the paper route<br/>
Uh Yeh, I'm hood approved and I'm street tested. You a nobody; anorexic<br/>
If you stay next to me you're close to a blessing. So, I'm guessin' I could get arrested for aggravated flexin' with all this ice on. My mic on, I apply pressure like a python. And everybody know this that body flow; bench press, cardio. They try to cramp a nigga style like a Charlie horse<br/>
Yeh, they plot on you, and they drop on ya. I put a Glock to your eye and call it glaucoma<br/>
Bow! From 30 nights of sipping dirty Sprite. I call this shit Bluetooth because I don't need a mic. 2Chainz
