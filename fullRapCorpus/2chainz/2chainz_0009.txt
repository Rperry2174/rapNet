On the hard floor she got her shit together so I respect her more<br/>
So if she ask me for some money she is not a whore<br/>

Show up life a big spenda I'm tryna fuck the world<br/>
Yeah fuck em girl you ain't gotta go back<br/>
Call em tell em that yo pussy got kidnapped<br/>
And she layin with her forehead on my six pack<br/>

Yeah I know her name but I like to call her boo<br/>
You shoulda put a chirp on her so she wouldn't move<br/>

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>

Keep it on the low mane<br/>
All we eat is lo mien<br/>
Came from the block<br/>
Now I gotta whole thang<br/>
And you betta put a low jack on yo hoe mane
