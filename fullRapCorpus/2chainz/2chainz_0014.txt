<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I got a recipe for my destiny<br/>
Southside Niggas to the left of me<br/>
Southside Niggas to the right of me<br/>
I'm a Southside Nigga to the death of me<br/>
On ecstasy you couldn't fuck with me<br/>
Gettin money is my specialty<br/>
Got the game on lock<br/>
And I got a muthafuckin extra key<br/>
Excellence is my pedigree<br/>
Buy a car and seem petty to her<br/>
And I paint the feet<br/>
Call that shit a pedicure<br/>
Niggas on the road ain't gettin no money that's a petty tour<br/>
I can fuck yo bitch, and act like I neva knew her<br/>
She the shit, I'm manure<br/>
I'm a good pussy connoisseur<br/>
Keep it on the low, so sometimes I get pussy on the floor<br/>
I'm on top, so look down below<br/>
Told y'all I'm bout to blow<br/>
I'm bout the dough, I count the dough<br/>
I cash out then I'm out the door<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Cap 1]</i><br/>

She Got Her Girl With Her, She Don't That I Be Hittin Her<br/>
Red Bottom Shoes With They Spikes All On It<br/>
Pocket Full Of 100, Make All These Bitches All Want Me<br/>
I Be Movin Thru The City, 100 Niggas Comin' With Me<br/>
On The Road Of Riches It Was Some Bitches Takin Pictures<br/>
Roll A 3-5, Put Together 2 Swishers<br/>
Movin Like A Box Fuck Aroung And get Ya' Issue<br/>
Man Um Pourin' Up Lean, Got Me Drinkin Out the Pitcher<br/>
Walkin In, And I'm southside Coolin<br/>
Trueys On, They Gotta Fuck With My Movement<br/>
Southside Duffle Bag Nigga We Boomin'<br/>
Look At How I Do It, Tell That I'm Gettin It<br/>
Plug On Da Way, I Told That Nigga 20 Minutes<br/>
Ridin Real Wheel Through The City Nigga Pimpin<br/>
First I Go The Fifths Then I'm Headed Up To Lenox<br/>
Spendin Big Bags, Man Um Runin Through A Check<br/>
