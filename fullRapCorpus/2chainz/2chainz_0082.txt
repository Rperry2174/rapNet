<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Birds in the water<br/>
I drop them birds in the water <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Hit me with ice and the soda<br/>
I drop them birds in the water <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I got 4 pots on the stove<br/>
Cooking up everyone's order<br/>
Watch me go Rippa the ripper<br/>
Watch me flex up when they check up<br/>
Watch me go hooka that cook-up<br/>
Look like the mock-up in <i>[?]</i><br/>
I drop them birds in the water <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I got 4 pots on the stove<br/>
Cooking up everyone's order<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I drop them birds in the water<br/>
Soak them in like I bathe em<br/>
Mucho murder with the coka<br/>
Nigga, we move like the navy<br/>
I drop them birds in the water<br/>
I'm bout to whip me some ovas <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cooking her like Benihana<br/>
My bitch bout to bring me some soda<br/>
I drop them birds in the water<br/>
Watch me flex up when I check up<br/>
Pull up in them brand new Rovers<br/>
I got the shit from the extras<br/>
Got my momma straight and bought me a house<br/>
Got all my bitches a whip and necklace<br/>
Pussy nigga, keep my name out your mouth<br/>
Before all my niggas get reckless<br/>
And pull out popping, all loaded, infected<br/>
223 and popping .40 vendetta<br/>
My migo wanna weigh that money on schedule<br/>
The yayo white and then the cloud leads to heavens<br/>
Freaking like a reverend when I'm on the medic<br/>
Canned and bought that bird in the pocket<br/>
That's fresh as hell<br/>
LA fitness with the punk hell aesthetics<br/>
Then they disappear like it's magicary<br/>
Eat the part I got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Cap 1:]</i><br/>
I drop them birds in the water<br/>
I take them shits out the plastic<br/>
I make them shit do pilates<br/>
Then make the bitch do gymnastics<br/>
Wearing Versace, spending money with mommy<br/>
Nigga, my bitch she the baddest<br/>
She tell me Uncle Savi papi you got it<br/>
Make us feel <i>[?]</i> like we the last<br/>
So while we better tell these niggas about it<br/>
I run with the hitters<br/>
The dealers, the flippers, the niggas that'll run a white man kicking<br/>
Sipping on that money water got these bitches popping Xan<br/>
And takin' shots with the liquor<br/>
In the kitchen water with me taking back the fish<br/>
And fuckin' up the possy and dishery<br/>
Hit the stove and put em birds in the water<br/>
Serving up everyoneg order<br/>
I got some more on the way<br/>
That strongest touch from California<br/>
Break it down and bag it up into quarters<br/>
I got a room full of pigeons<br/>
Nelly Furtado when the avocado keep a nigga busy<br/>
My phone steady jugging<br/>
I break it down<br/>
<br/>
