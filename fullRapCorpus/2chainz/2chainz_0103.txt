You gotta known how to have fun when you get these checks man. <br/>
Nah, I’mma put this on your camera. You need… I’m bout to tell you right now.  <br/>
Tell me what I need. Tity Boi. Tity Boi.  <br/>
You need to tell Cris go on let you go. <br/>
Young Mula it out, we have fun over here, we just eating.  <br/>
We having fun, we just doing stuff, we don’t even care about. <br/>
(Go get my shit). Young Money, we care<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn’t for Wayne, it wouldn’t be<br/>
A lot of dudes in the game, including me<br/>
We was smoking that gas in ’03<br/>
Was gon’ sell a few bags to Lil Fee<br/>
Couple years removed from HBs<br/>
Tatted lyrics from Jigga to Jay-Z<br/>
I went to Eastover before Katrina<br/>
Remember going to Magic riding in my B-mer<br/>
And this was way before FEMA, and you was rappin’ and singin’<br/>
And I was slanging the Ps and smoking nigga like Newport<br/>
Comin up off of Too Short, my underwear was my hoop shorts<br/>
And then I went on tour and recorded a song on your tour bus<br/>
And that was ’08, that’s the first time I met Drake<br/>
When I hit your cup with that drank, had a nigga stomach like wait<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea, that my dog, <br/>
that my dog uhh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, <br/>
that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dio, yea that my dog<br/>
<br/>
You relocated to MIA<br/>
You told me shawdy this where I stay<br/>
I came down to pay a visit<br/>
You told me Zoe Pound and them was trippin<br/>
And you, you wasn’t dippin’<br/>
Had the M-16 and with the extra clip, ready to act ignorant<br/>
Ridin’ off in the Phantom, and Mr. G he was driving<br/>
Pumpin’ that Playaz Circle, you told me that we was riding<br/>
And I told you that I was rappin’, I told you I wasn’t writing<br/>
You said Luda was foolish because he wasn’t excited<br/>
That was way before Tyga, I saw Nicki with Gucci<br/>
You said, “You can make a million rappin’ ‘bout some pussy, I did.”<br/>
T, Fewq, Mally Mal, shining like Armor Oil<br/>
You can ask Mac, I was YM ‘fore all of y’all<br/>
Stunna said I reminded him of Johnny<br/>
In this world you either selling or you buying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea, that my dog, <br/>
that my dog uhh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, <br/>
that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea that my dog<br/>
<br/>
You tatted your face and changed the culture<br/>
You screamed soowoo and them gangstas loved it<br/>
You bought a Bugatti so you can flex<br/>
And most of the bad bitches your ex<br/>
Ride ‘til the wheels fall off and they got wobbly<br/>
Duffle Bag video, we shot that bitch on Godby<br/>
You was holding a sty-ry, I had more gold than a pirate<br/>
They said it ain’t about stylin’, what they tryin’ to kick knowledge<br/>
Duffle Bag Boys, yea I can’t forget Dolla<br/>
In going to get the money, it’s some words that I follow<br/>
I swallow my pride, smoking endo outside<br/>
Straight from Collegrove, I’m reporting live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea, that my dog, <br/>
that my dog uhh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, <br/>
that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yea that my dog
