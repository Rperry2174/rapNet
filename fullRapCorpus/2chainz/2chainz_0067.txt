<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm 'bout my commas, I'm 'bout my come up<br/>
Young nigga run up, run up the summer<br/>
Tats on my stomach like Makaveli<br/>
Back of the back in the back of Telly's<br/>
With the racks in the sac I will rap on belly<br/>
They will act real really niggas acting sidity<br/>
Ain't no Actavis in the city, woah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg<br/>
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg<br/>
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg<br/>
This for my road dawg, this is a real nigga role call<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We spend it and get it back, we had invented that<br/>
See we on the internet, fly as an insect<br/>
Shine like the moonlight, told 'em gesundheit<br/>
I'm throwing cheese up like it's a food fight<br/>
They talking about blowing that dough and I tell you, I do not believe them<br/>
When I was on Codeine I went to the store and bought all of the liters<br/>
Follow the leader, monkey see, monkey do<br/>
It was critical bought the <i>[?]</i> went and bought three pair of shoes<br/>
Trapping all night, you know the rules<br/>
Trapping all night, it ain't no rules<br/>
I pay my dues, copped it in twos<br/>
And all I do is sell shit, I should go on a cruise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
