<i>[Intro: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Umm<br/>
They say we smoke, we gon' smoke<br/>
You say we gon' drink ,we gon' drink<br/>
You say you want drugs, we want drugs<br/>
We don't give a fuck what you think<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Big dually parked in my driveway<br/>
Hanging out that motherfucker sideways<br/>
Residue in my fingernail, make every day like Friday<br/>
This how we do it on the southside<br/>
Bumpin' Trapaveli on the car ride<br/>
Bad booty shots got you lopsided<br/>
I buy a new car if my car die<br/>
Solid gold Jesus, two of 'em<br/>
Backseat I'ma call it futon<br/>
Ride around in motherfucker uwop<br/>
Like who-a-who-a-who-a-who-a<br/>
Bought a bad bitch, I got a crew of 'em<br/>
It's four fur coats, I got a zoo of 'em<br/>
It's thug life, niggas I don't fool with 'em<br/>
I don't care if I went to school with 'em<br/>
Come out that thing like yeet<br/>
Everybody with me, nigga D<br/>
Everybody with me, nigga D<br/>
Everybody with me nigga eat<br/>
Black ink all on my body<br/>
I pray a body don't get on my shotty<br/>
I pray nobody don't get in my way nigga<br/>
A to the motherfucking K nigga<br/>
Start spittin' lyrical bullets<br/>
Don't be surprised if I pull it<br/>
Don't be surprised if I shoot it<br/>
We the type to pick on a bully<br/>
We the type to ride in foreigns<br/>
We the type to ride on Forgis<br/>
Pinky ring look like a smoothie<br/>
Flame goin' up on a Tuesday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Big thing parked in the driveway<br/>
Squad hotter than Zimbabwe<br/>
IPhone got a nigga irate<br/>
Ringing all day, all day, like Kanye<br/>
Got AK bullets with your name on 'em<br/>
Powder on my hands, King James on 'em<br/>
I walk around this bitch with my chest out<br/>
Yeah nigga bout to go Ving Rhames on 'em<br/>
Man look at who I done became on 'em<br/>
Niggas look who and I went switch lanes on 'em<br/>
All my niggas brainless, need brain donors<br/>
We movin' birds, gettin' birds, shit stains on 'em<br/>
Man fuck these niggas, I don't know these niggas<br/>
From Jumpstreet it's been M-O-B nigga<br/>
It's M-O-B since my D-O-B nigga<br/>
And since my D-O-B I've been on my J-O-B nigga<br/>
I shoot a nigga ass like Ginobili nigga<br/>
I kick a nigga ass like Shinobi nigga<br/>
I give your bitch dick like Moby nigga<br/>
She know the words to my songs, karaoke winner<br/>
Smokey Robinson couldn't out smoke me nigga<br/>
I'm on her cheese like anchovies nigga<br/>
I get a kilo and keep it lowkey nigga<br/>
Cause you on that bullshit and you nosy nigga<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't ya?<br/>
I'm back on my bullshit, gangster<br/>
I'm back up to full strength, gangster<br/>
Pat-pat at the pulpit, gangster, amen<br/>
And I still root for the underdog<br/>
And you the pile of shit under the underdog<br/>
These niggas ain't eatin' like a Ramadan<br/>
I shoot the driver in the head, make 'em honk the horn<br/>
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)<br/>
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)<br/>
Got big booty bitches in their under-alls<br/>
And they pussy gettin' wetter than a thunderstorm<br/>
And I swear when I'm in them panty hose<br/>
I'm like a kid in the candy store<br/>
But I got this bright red bandana though<br/>
Flingin' it like I'm a matador<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz &amp; Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
You on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?<br/>
