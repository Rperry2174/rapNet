Excuse me, excuse me<br/>
<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
My life is a movie<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I came from the mud<br/>
Came from the bottom<br/>
Spot 'em, I got 'em<br/>
I bought a bandana for 600 dollars<br/>
Mr. Miyagi<br/>
I like that pussy real soggy<br/>
I bought her noodles and sake<br/>
Favorite meal used to be chocolate<br/>
I used to stay with my cousins<br/>
Heat the house up with the oven<br/>
Airport tried to make us move without payin' us<br/>
We told 'em we ain't budgin'<br/>
We stole our cable from next door<br/>
It was still a finesse though<br/>
I'm still here, where the rest go?<br/>
This right here manifesto<br/>
I got some gold on my front tooth<br/>
And my hair grow like it's kudzu<br/>
Told her take a hike like hut two<br/>
I was raised by the Huxtables<br/>
I was raised in apartments<br/>
Right up under that yellow light<br/>
Right on top of that bando<br/>
Stand on the couch when I feel like, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
Can't make no excuses<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
My life is a movie<br/>
<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
Please accept my apologies<br/>
This a biography<br/>
See through you niggas like radio-ology<br/>
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I dip my bread in the Kool-Aid<br/>
My partner wrecked the new car<br/>
He only had that bitch two days<br/>
When you was rockin' the new Js<br/>
I was servin' some new Js<br/>
Went to the prom in a J car<br/>
He had just bought a new Mustang<br/>
Now I walked around with a digi scale<br/>
Paraphernalia in fingernails<br/>
Yeah you did dirt, but you finna tell<br/>
I used to get 20 of 'em in the mail, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
Can't make no excuses<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
My life is a movie<br/>
<br/>
I put hot sauce on my tater chips<br/>
The fact I said tater chips<br/>
Back on that crazy shit<br/>
Me and Ruth Chris, we got a relationship<br/>
Yeah I'm ghetto as fuck<br/>
I told 'em I got that strong<br/>
Tell 'em meet me up the street<br/>
For Christmas I want me a stove<br/>
For Christmas I want me a scale<br/>
For Christmas I want me some sandwich bags<br/>
If I go to the hospital<br/>
Better put rims on the ambulance<br/>
Better put lean in my IV<br/>
Nurse better have double Ds<br/>
Rest in peace to Double D<br/>
I'm from the ghetto, we a hundred deep<br/>
<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
Can't make no excuses<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
I'm ghetto, excuse me<br/>
My life is a movie<br/>
<br/>
You know, as kids we don't choose where we grow up at. You know, it's a living arrangement, it's a living situation. You know, but I'm thankful for everything that I've been through, for every seed that's been planted. You know, everything that grew on me. You dig what I'm sayin'? I come from that. I'm goin' this way, though. You dig what I'm sayin'? Yeah, straight up, a ghetto child, though, man. Super duper blessed, man, super duper blessed. Really anointed, anointed by the Lord so you know, I'm supposed to be here, you know what I'm sayin'? But excuse me, please, excuse me. I'm tryna go that way... that way
