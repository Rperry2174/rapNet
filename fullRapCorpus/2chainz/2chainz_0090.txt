<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I treat Goat like he was tata, dealin' up at Popeyes<br/>
In the fastline, I move him over to the right side<br/>
Mac-11 life style, burrrt then I hop out<br/>
Dem burrrt, then it's lights out, I'm spazin' on you right now<br/>
Mama's only child, the crack house was my daycare<br/>
Being front to god, grey hair, see that's that old money<br/>
Kenmore stove money, packs on G rouge money<br/>
Ridin' down in that foreign whip the color of snow bunny<br/>
Pull up right to the beach and left the boat runnin'<br/>
Soo sudden, you a comedian, all your flows funny<br/>
Dope funny, walk through the door, she like "Oh honey"<br/>
Plus I got a whip and a lock, they call me 4hunna<br/>
Tryna come clean off the spot, I'm talkin' detergent<br/>
Fuck her didn't answer my phone, I gotta leave urgent<br/>
Everythin' I did in the past was intellectual<br/>
Now it's Mr. Gimme-your-section-with-a-extra-booth<br/>
Show you what the extra do<br/>
Want a four door, so I bought me an extra coupe<br/>
One for me, one for me, really ain't no effort to it<br/>
Mr. Impeccable, turn you to a vegetable, fuck her on the sectional<br/>
Pull on her hair while she's lickin' on the testicles<br/>
Sixteen carefully, swag sold separately<br/>
Aimin' for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony<br/>
Laid on the floor and I made your hoe come vacuum me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The-Dream:]</i><br/>
I'm on my Bobby Brown, babe<br/>
Put it on me tenderoni<br/>
And I got one of you in every town<br/>
To put it on me, I'm never lonely<br/>
Swimmin' in your hits, babe<br/>
And I'm gone like trip, babe<br/>
Show out, show out<br/>
Show out, show out, show out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The-Dream:]</i><br/>
It's all about you<br/>
It's all about you (everything we do)<br/>
It's all about you<br/>
It's all about you (everything I do)<br/>
It's all about you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The-Dream &amp; 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Every trapper, ever rapper<br/>
Everything I do<br/>
Every baller, ever actor<br/>
Just wanna impress you<br/>
Every actor, every actress<br/>
I just wanna trust you<br/>
I'm just tryna get you to that mattress<br/>
You're the finest that money can't buy<br/>
The finest shit that catches your eye, my<br/>
Now ball on these bitches<br/>
Go and ball on these bitches<br/>
Wanna see you ball on these bitches<br/>
Baby, ball on these bitches, yeah
