<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Used to treat my mattress like the ATM<br/>
Bond number 9 that's my favorite scent<br/>
Can't forget the kush I'm talking OG<br/>
Rest in peace to pop he was an OG<br/>
Oh yeah, 285 I had that pack on me<br/>
Uh, I can not forget I had that strap on me<br/>
Yeah, rest in peace to my nigga Doe<br/>
All he ever want to do was ball<br/>
That was the easy part<br/>
We playing that Weezy hard<br/>
We sit in the kitchen late<br/>
We tryna to make an escape<br/>
Trying to make me a mil<br/>
So I'ma keep me a plate<br/>
I told 'em shawty can leave<br/>
So I'ma keep me a rake<br/>
So I'ma keep me a Wraith<br/>
My jewelry look like a lake<br/>
Today I'm in the Maybach<br/>
And that car came with some drapes<br/>
You know I look like a safe<br/>
I put you back in your place<br/>
I look you right in your face<br/>
Sing to your bitch like I'm Drake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Good drank, big knots<br/>
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks<br/>
Drop top, no hot box<br/>
12 tried to pull me over pink slips to the cops<br/>
She said the liquor give her thizz face<br/>
Put the dick in her rib cage<br/>
Whips out Kunta Kinte<br/>
Diamonds clear like Bombay<br/>
Take your babies no Harambe<br/>
Play with keys like Doc Dre<br/>
3K like Andr√©<br/>
Need a girl call her, come through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
Your trunk in the front well check this out my top in the trunk<br/>
You play with my money then check this out your pop in the trunk<br/>
Three mil in a month but I just did three years on a bunk<br/>
Oh you in a slump I'm headed to Oakland like Kevin Durant<br/>
What is your point, strolling with Steph, fuck Kevin Durant<br/>
Lay on on my trap, play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat<br/>
I'm taking the cheese and killing the rats<br/>
Gucci Mane call me the cat with the rat<br/>
I'm swervin' but I'm in back of the back<br/>
I'm Persian, man I got hoes from Iraq<br/>
I'm servin' I pay a bird for that<br/>
He nervous I ain't got no word for that<br/>
He heard and want all of his purses back<br/>
He mixing the seal with the percocets<br/>
She perfect and she got perky breast<br/>
I just want some of that turkey neck<br/>
Trapper of the year I'm from Boulder Crest<br/>
You snitch of the year cause you told the best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Good drank, big knots<br/>
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks<br/>
Drop top, no hot box<br/>
12 tried to pull me over pink slips to the cops<br/>
She said the liquor give her thizz face<br/>
Put the dick in her rib cage<br/>
Whips out Kunta Kinte<br/>
Diamonds clear like Bombay<br/>
Take your babies no Harambe<br/>
Play with keys like Doc Dre<br/>
3K like Andre<br/>
Need a girl call her, come through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
