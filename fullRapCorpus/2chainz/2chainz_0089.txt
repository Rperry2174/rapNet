<i>[Kevin Gates:]</i><br/>
Some individuals look at the accomplishments of other individuals and allow themselves to become jealous.<br/>
Everybody know what it take. Everybody don't do what it take, I don't get tired<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kevin Gates:]</i><br/>
Sometimes you grind from the bottom, get your chips straight<br/>
Sometimes you can make a million off a mixtape<br/>
Sometimes you get to the top and then your family hate<br/>
Don't give a damn what them haters say<br/>
I feel like I'm 'posed to be ballin'<br/>
Supposed to be winnin', yeah<br/>
I feel like I'm 'posed to be ballin'<br/>
No one gave me shit, yeah<br/>
I feel like, I feel like I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I did a song with Kevin way 'fore ya'll followed him on his Instagram<br/>
Did a song with Young Dolph 'fore ya'll even know what Memphis had<br/>
I intend to smash, no pen and pad<br/>
Married to the game, no strings attached<br/>
Married to the game, got a season pass<br/>
You wasn't here, <i>[?]</i> don't even <i>[?]</i><br/>
From Decatur to <i>[?]</i> I make love with a mink on<br/>
I'm top floor, you need a key just to get off of<br/>
Need a key just to get off of<br/>
Need a key just to get off of<br/>
Hanging rappers on a chop board<br/>
Outline 'em in chalk Lord<br/>
Thought so<br/>
Trap nigga on a pop tour<br/>
Break dancing on cardboard<br/>
Wrist workin' that Pyrex<br/>
In the bando with that <i>[?]</i><br/>
50 shots with my nigga Jonny<br/>
Somebody stole the truck from Benihanas<br/>
Next day he bought a new one<br/>
Like you win some and you lose some<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I'm supposed to be ballin', 'posed to be winnin'<br/>
I spent thousands on linens and this is just the beginnin'<br/>
I bought my momma a crib before I got my own place<br/>
Picked my pop up from prison and gave 'em places to stay<br/>
See I am handpicked by God, I defied all the odds<br/>
I need a sign that say foreigns only in my garage<br/>
You know I'm vicious and hungry, my competition is phony<br/>
I'm on my way, kowabunga<br/>
To all my cousins, I love ya<br/>
I work hard for this shit, I got sleep deprivation<br/>
My momma tellin' me, boy you gotta take a vacation<br/>
I got one in the air, another one in rotation<br/>
And when they ask me where I'm at, I say the trap my location<br/>
<br/>

<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
When I dropped Trapaveli, I stayed in 3 star 'telis<br/>
With 2 time felons, one time I was bailin'<br/>
Every Tom, Dick, and Helen<br/>
They would act like they was reppin'<br/>
Who was real? Who was fake?<br/>
It was hard to keep it separate<br/>
And my bankroll big, this big, need excedrin<br/>
And excessive marijuana in my motherfuckin' prison<br/>
We would wrap it like a present<br/>
We would act it like the preset<br/>
You was actin' like a peasant<br/>
I hold an eagle in the desert<br/>
With the Rollie and the bezel<br/>
I was fuckin' with the bastards<br/>
Yeah I am so slick, bitch you better hit your hazards<br/>
And I bought a Versace plate just to eat my salad<br/>
And I can count money til I get a fuckin' callous<br/>
