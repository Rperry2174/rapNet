<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
I mean, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Got a 35 in my roll paper<br/>
Spice One riding east bay gangster<br/>
Got fuck up niggas on the west side<br/>
Give a nigga to the west ride<br/>
Hit a nigga, YG 400<br/>
Told the homie Mustard keep it 100<br/>
Told Uncle Snoop roll up one<br/>
Gave me a badge, you can choke one<br/>
Felt it to serve you in my house shoes<br/>
They ain't got the Bentley color piru<br/>
Nip first, last name Hu$$le<br/>
<i>[?]</i> lyrical muscle<br/>
Dr Dre had the best instrumentals<br/>
<i>[?]</i> was my father figure<br/>
He had me walking around yelling "no bitch"<br/>
And showed me how this rapping make you hella rich, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's go<br/>
If they ask about a nigga they ain't know<br/>
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's go<br/>
If they ask about a nigga they ain't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Talking Ice Cube with the jeri curl<br/>
Used to practice looking hard like my nigga Earl<br/>
Screaming fuck the world like my nigga Pac<br/>
Crap <i>[?]</i> Sir Mix Alot<br/>
DJ Quik, tonight's the night<br/>
Mac Mall, Mac 10, and my nigga Tight<br/>
C-Bo, rest in peace Mac Dre<br/>
Schoolboy, Problem, rest in peace <i>[?]</i><br/>
Dogg Pound, Daz and Kurupt<br/>
MCA, Mr. Fab was a must<br/>
Eazy-E feel legit and my homie Burn<br/>
I get a lot of love out in California<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's go<br/>
If they ask about a nigga they ain't know<br/>
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's go<br/>
If they ask about a nigga they ain't know<br/>
<br/>
Ask about a nigga, they ain't know<br/>
Dolla got the ride, '64<br/>
'Rari with the suicide doors<br/>
Diamonds, I might bust it down though<br/>
Diamonds, I might bust it down though<br/>
<i>[?]</i> shine though<br/>
Sipping on the ice and D'usse<br/>
Dolla got all the groupies<br/>
If they ain't paying they gon' run it on sight<br/>
She going taking dick all night, ay<br/>
<br/>
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's go<br/>
If they ask about a nigga they ain't know
