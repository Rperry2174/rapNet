Yeah, day party at my crib, you invited<br/>
Day party at my crib, bring a lighter<br/>
Don't be going out by the deep-end if you can't swim<br/>
Ain't no lifeguard, yeah, I'm a trife God<br/>
Yeah, I'm a trench guard, yeah, hit up this park<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work<br/>
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work<br/>
Yeah, I'm in and out of the ville, yeah, I got a profit to get<br/>
I get to licking around, I get to pointing at bitches<br/>
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, what?<br/>
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, yeah<br/>
Day party at my crib, you invited<br/>
Day party at my crib, bring a lighter<br/>
<br/>
BBQ, no key cools, no cheap shoes<br/>
Good sea food, good beach food<br/>
Should teach schools shit been cooped<br/>
Could thief jewel, unequal, illegal<br/>
I go to Gucci to mingle<br/>
Got 'em hot nose like a single<br/>
I make a left, hit the blinker<br/>
Hublot or the AP, both of 'em cost 80 piece<br/>
Mealtime, y'all can barely eat<br/>
I'm wired up, I can barely sleep<br/>
Told y'all niggas, most y'all niggas, showed y'all niggas<br/>
Coach y'all niggas, broke y'all niggas, smoked y'all niggas<br/>
Choked y'all niggas, poked y'all women<br/>
Had them chickens covered like Tabasco<br/>
Bales of weed down the street from the pasture<br/>
Got a garage filled up with Caspers<br/>
Me and my scale live happily ever after<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work<br/>
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work<br/>
Yeah, I'm in and out of the ville, yeah, I got a profit to get<br/>
I get to licking around, I get to pointing at bitches<br/>
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, what?<br/>
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, yeah<br/>
Day party at my crib, you invited<br/>
Day party at my crib, bring a lighter
