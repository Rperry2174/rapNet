<i>[Hook - Skooly:]</i><br/>
Young nigga thuggin' for a reason, pro'ly cause it's all that they teach him<br/>
I come through killin' every season, pray they don't call the policeman<br/>
Please don't call the policeman, please don't call the policeman<br/>
Please don't call the policeman, please don't call the policeman<br/>
All I ever wanted was respect, young nigga thuggin' in the streets<br/>
Please don't call the detective, please don't call the police!<br/>
Please don't call the policeman, please don't call the policeman<br/>
Please don't call the police, please don't call the police<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Skooly:]</i><br/>
Wait, verse time, killin' these niggas, it's murk time<br/>
Puttin' these niggas in a hearse time<br/>
To my enemies, I done had worse times<br/>
Nigga, it's work time, put a pussy nigga in the dirt time<br/>
Really don't wanna see me work, son - pull back the curtain, woo<br/>
Why you do 'em like that? Boy you need to muhfuckin' stop that<br/>
Hangin' wit' the killers and I'm feelin' presidential<br/>
Big brother went and got the fuckin' drop head<br/>
Now I make a old bitch drop head, I'll make yo' bitch drop head<br/>
Put the pedal to the floor, now her panties on the floor<br/>
Nigga, I'll make yo' bitch drop that!<br/>
I smoke the most of the reefer, hangin' wit' Dos Cadenas<br/>
Made it rain, hurricane, give out that money like FEMA<br/>
Turn that lil bitch to Katrina, fuck up the money from features<br/>
Watch how a thug get a Beamer all from rappin' and singin'<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Short Dawg:]</i><br/>
We need 8 in these streets like a straight out<br/>
Coupe wit' the roof you could take off, crew finna take off<br/>
Killin' these hoes if I pull up wit' tech<br/>
Cause the <i>[?]</i> will save y'all<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, wanted to play ball<br/>
Got addicted to watchin' that lean drip<br/>
Now I step in the mall wit' a stack of new hundreds<br/>
Run through that blue cheese like it's wing dip<br/>
Most of my Locs be like "Fre$h, you too clean, Crip"<br/>
Don't work out that much but my jeans ripped<br/>
Class by myself like detention<br/>
Cause most of the niggas wife hoes I done seen strip<br/>
So I had to give these hoes<br/>
I had to give these hoes someone to pay<br/>
She pull up on me when she wantin' that pipe<br/>
Nigga, yo' crib is just somewhere to stay<br/>
All I had in the trap was a blunt and a K<br/>
(And) a bundle of yay<br/>
Most the fiends don't believe that I made a transition<br/>
They still call my number today<br/>
Extended the clips for them niggas who say they will rob me<br/>
It ain't hard to find me<br/>
If the proof's in the pudding then call me Bill Cosby<br/>
Or just ask my mama, it ain't no mistake that a<br/>
<br/>
