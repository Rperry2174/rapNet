<i>[Pharrell:]</i><br/>
You, you, you, you, you<br/>
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth<br/>
Maybe your friends are confused<br/>
I'm gonna tell you the truth<br/>
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan<br/>
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan<br/>
All week, keeping on, my mind is...<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
Maybe now, but not next time<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
There we go, that' it for sure<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
Maybe just a little more<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Juicy, squeeze it, then juicy<br/>
Sipping on the D'usse<br/>
Rocking some Medusa, give a fuck what you say<br/>
Give a fuck what you say<br/>
In the club, I wrote this for the plug<br/>
I wrote this for a hater that was looking for some love<br/>
A DJ competition, I'm mixing in the kitchen<br/>
Now who gon' do the dishes<br/>
Bankroll thicker than Deelishis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell:]</i><br/>
You, you, you, you, you<br/>
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth<br/>
Maybe your friends are confused<br/>
I'm gonna tell you the truth<br/>
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan<br/>
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan<br/>
All week, keeping on, my mind is...<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
Maybe now, but not next time<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
There we go, that' it for sure<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
Maybe just a little more<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Drug connotation in my population<br/>
I want a conversation, don't want no confrontation<br/>
Pull up in a hardtop, watch how I race it<br/>
Trap to the wrap like watch how I embrace it<br/>
Louis Vans on, they don't come with laces<br/>
And we talking straight shots, we don't need no chaser<br/>
Tell her I don't chase her, swap her, I replace it<br/>
Bracelet, this is Rollie, Rollie, this is bracelet<br/>
Pass the medication<br/>
Rounds upon rounds, I am nowhere around<br/>
I'm nowhere to be found<br/>
I'm on flights over lights, I'm so close up to Christ<br/>
I might ask for advice, I might ask for it twice<br/>
Look at my ice, I'm so nice, it's like Mardi Gras<br/>
Mama I shot me a man, please go hide the gun<br/>
When she ask me my number, I say I'm the one<br/>
Rushing summer to summer until someone come<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell:]</i><br/>
You, you, you, you, you<br/>
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth<br/>
Maybe your friends are confused<br/>
I'm gonna tell you the truth<br/>
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan<br/>
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan<br/>
All week, keeping on, my mind is...<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
Maybe now, but not next time<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
There we go, that' it for sure<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
Maybe just a little more<br/>
Going in, going in, going in, going in<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and touch the sky<br/>
Go ahead and touch the sky<br/>
Dancing where you are<br/>
Go ahead and touch the sky
