<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, what happened, what happened?<br/>
Yeah, damn, girl, what happened?<br/>
What happened? What happened?<br/>

I thought you weren't fucking with me no more<br/>
Damn, girl, what happened?<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
She said oh, you got that comeback, she said my dick is a necessity<br/>
Drop my drawers, and pull out my longevity<br/>
She just hop on it, and then she forget everything<br/>
Oh man, who’s obsessed with me, when she leave me, she come back like she ain’t never leave<br/>
She talk bad about my new bitch, cause we got chemistry<br/>
She said it’s not jealousy, allegedly<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more<br/>
Girl, what happened , you act like you don’t miss me , oh my god you suck at acting<br/>
I thought you don’t fuck with me no more, girl I’m laughing<br/>
She said, she get real, when I get rid of all her batteries<br/>
She be talking about how she moving on with her life, she tired of my shit and she can do<br/>
Better<br/>
She told herself; she ain’t fucking with me no more<br/>
She done lied to herself, she'll lie to who whatever<br/>
Talking about, she seen me with such and such<br/>
I say it’s nothing, you fucking duck<br/>
She said yeah, nigga, what I look like<br/>
I said just like my new daughter<br/>
She said ohh, you make me sick<br/>
I love you , I hate you , I’m leaving , I’m lying<br/>
Cause none of them niggas, can never be you, can never be you, I don’t know why<br/>
If she’s over me, I look up to the sky, I see her falling for me like a bomb, she said, I know<br/>
Your gonna<br/>
Miss me when I’m gone, I just co­sign and we make up for lost time<br/>
She always say , this is the last time<br/>
She love better, than she lie<br/>
She always say, this is the last time<br/>
She said that last time, wait<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more<br/>
Girl, what happened<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more<br/>
Hold up wait<br/>
You’re lying to ya self, (stop lying) you compromise with yaself<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more<br/>
Hold up wait<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more<br/>
Hold up wait<br/>
Damn girl what happened?<br/>
Hold up, hold up, hold up<br/>
What happened, what happened?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
First you change your email, then ya number became private<br/>
I bet you found another nigga you can vibe with<br/>
Quit lying to yourself, retrace all ya steps<br/>
Fucking with them suckers, they gonna have ya playing with yaself<br/>
I’m a smooth operator; you don’t need a vibrator<br/>
Licking everything below, the navel, cause I’m able<br/>
Ball so maafakin hard, tape my ankle<br/>
Ball so maafakin hard , check my bankroll<br/>
You talkin bout you don't fuck with a nigga, go outta town like you done with a nigga<br/>
Really ain't much done, with a nigga<br/>
Straight shots, put liquor on it, and lick it<br/>
Put the x in the exceptional, put the x in the extra­ho<br/>
I put the x in x and o<br/>
I got the game in professional, yeah, my dick is the antidote<br/>
You can ride my on­top, like an animal<br/>
That time, I wanted to smoke with ya best­friend, I wanna fuck yall on the patio, you miss<br/>
When I kiss on<br/>
Ya earring, you miss when I kiss on your clit ring<br/>
Thats why I put you in this 16, I’ll fuck you and watch you on the big screen<br/>
Yeahhhh!!<br/>
She said oh, you got that comeback, she said my dick is a necessity, (Lil Wayne)<br/>
Drop down my drawers, and pull out my longevity<br/>
She just hop on it, and fuck it, everything<br/>
She like you know, I’ll never leave<br/>
She’s on that dick, like leather seats<br/>
You know that, make up sex be extra sweet<br/>
So let’s break up, and make up like Pleasure P<br/>
You always say , this is ya last time<br/>
You always say , this is ya last time<br/>
You always say, this is ya last time<br/>
You said that last time, girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more. girl, what happened<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more. girl, what happened<br/>
You’re lying to ya self, (stop lying) you compromise with yaself<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more<br/>
You’re lying to ya self, (stop lying) you compromise with yaself<br/>
I thought you wasn’t fucking with me no more
