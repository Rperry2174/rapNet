<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Murder, Murder, This Right Here That Murder<br/>
Pulled the Car Out The Garage, They Screaming Bloody Murder<br/>
Murder, Murder Chalk Line Around Your Daughter<br/>
3 Cell Phones and I Still Don't Ever Call Her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Murder, Murder, Smoking on that murder<br/>
If a girl out with me, Just know she Murder<br/>
Murder, Murder, Take Her Ass like Burglar<br/>
Then I Put her On the Loud and feed her turkey burgers<br/>
Murder, Murder, This is Bloody Murder<br/>
All This ice all over me, I should wear a thermos<br/>
Murder, Murder, Hit you with the Burner<br/>
Hit you with the burner, hit you with the burner<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Murder, Murder, yea I'm killing niggas beats<br/>
When I'm out of town and on the stage it's rest in peace<br/>
Murder, Murder Somebody call my lawyer<br/>
They said I was killing Tennessee when I was down in Florida<br/>
Murder, Murder, my shoes none than a quarter<br/>
Rapping with the murder team nobody wanna record us<br/>
Murder, Murder Listen to the chorus<br/>
Niggas wanna know how I get it when I get<br/>
Don't worry, Just know it's murder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]</i><br/>
This right here is murderous<br/>
I'm Mama Kreay the gangsterous<br/>
From the East to the West it gets dangerous<br/>
When you get that dough on display and shit<br/>
Bitches will be hating this<br/>
But my mind still climbs for greater-ness<br/>
That money that I'm playing with<br/>
Put a whole in your head with no blame for it<br/>
Saying it<br/>
I'm Kaying<br/>
Come back to the block and I'm spraying it<br/>
Delaying, I'm stopping it<br/>
Put a end to your life, I'm blocking it<br/>
Your career bitch, you was never on<br/>
I heard 2 Chainz blocked you off his phone<br/>
Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout to ho<br/>
Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout the doe<br/>
<br/>
