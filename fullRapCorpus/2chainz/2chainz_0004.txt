<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm Higher Than A Parachute<br/>
And A Pair Of Eagles<br/>
I Might Paralyze Ya I'm a Needa Paralegal<br/>
And I ain't fantasizing when I mingle with the women<br/>
I'll take you and her now I got a pair of singles<br/>
Then I cut em up<br/>
Like a pair of scissors<br/>
Hit em with dat batman and hang from the ceiling<br/>
Suicide doors, hang from the Bentley<br/>
Nobody had to die but I made me a killin<br/>
Big Wheel Whippin<br/>
Bitch Still Chillin<br/>
What more can I say<br/>
I'm Dealin<br/>
Get Dough With Dilllan<br/>
Bitch Don't Act Right<br/>
I'm Puttin Her Out Of The Crib<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Baby this is Kush<br/>
And It Cost Me 600<br/>
I Know You Can't Afford It<br/>
You Just Got a Big Onion<br/>
And Ya Head FY<br/>
You a red girl<br/>
Shawty you a nut<br/>
Bitch I'm a Squirrel<br/>
Niggas Know Me<br/>
They Know My Pedigree<br/>
I'm a Big Dawg you Better Flea<br/>
No More Shoppin Sprees<br/>
To and From Miami<br/>
And Without Me You Can't Even Get In Club Miami<br/>
I DOUBT IT<br/>
My WHole Crew Bout It<br/>
Hotel Room You See My Chain from The Lobby<br/>
Charm So Heavy Like My Muh Fuggn Wallet<br/>
Talk Shit And My Car Pull The Bitch Out IT<br/>
Tell The Bitch AUDI
