Kush packs and them rubber bands were my starter kit<br/>
Gun shots at your mama house cause you started it<br/>
Niggas taking every damn thing, if they ordered it<br/>
You front the packs and we don't call you back, then it's over with<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Mama saying boy why y'all playing in that water<br/>
Got granny what y'all doing with my <i>[?]</i><br/>
Bigger sister saying y'all lil boy look suspicious<br/>
Got mama saying what y'all doing with my dishes<br/>
Twelve came through and we had for the fishes<br/>
Got locked up in school, we ain't worried 'bout detention<br/>
<i>[?]</i> mama walking through the 'partments with a <i>[?]</i><br/>
Whoadie mama said I know y'all boys ain't been to school<br/>
Hit the D-mall like a motherfucking school<br/>
Yeah we shoot but we in the pool shooting pool<br/>
<i>[?]</i> rushed the card I have to call the fucking <i>[?]</i><br/>
If swag was a plane I'm finna motherfucking take off<br/>
Watch me shake the fake off, watch me shake the fake off<br/>
I am on so much green I can play golf<br/>
Kush pack and the rubber band and a digi scale<br/>
And a zip lock, residue all in my fingernails<br/>
<br/>
Kush packs and them rubber bands were my starter kit<br/>
Gun shots at your mama house cause you started it<br/>
Niggas taking every damn thing, if they ordered it<br/>
You front the packs and we don't call you back, then it's over with<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Young Dolph:]</i><br/>
Selling bags, zip locks, six Glocks, twenty scales<br/>
Sick spot, fuck my car you should see what my bitch got<br/>
If you ain't get no money my nigga then you can't hang at this spot<br/>
Nigga wanna play then okay somebody get shot<br/>
Rollies for the whole team, urine full of codeine<br/>
Pounds on the Sunbeam, baby ballers with more lean<br/>
I'm young and dumb and I ain't got no patience<br/>
I'm 'bout to pull up at the trap and see what's shaking<br/>
I bought me fifty he front me fifty, I thought 'bout taking it<br/>
My nigga told me don't do it so I went paid the man<br/>
I let your bitch come to me and then told her get away from here<br/>
Strong packs and calculators, ain't nothing but a pint in that refrigerator<br/>
<br/>
Kush packs and them rubber bands were my starter kit<br/>
Gun shots at your mama house cause you started it<br/>
Niggas taking every damn thing, if they ordered it<br/>
You front the packs and we don't call you back, then it's over with<br/>
