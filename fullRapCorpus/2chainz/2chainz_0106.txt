Okay we gotta lotta dope<br/>

And I done seen so many cowards croak<br/>
It’s like watching flowers grow<br/>
I mean, please, don't you cowards know?<br/>
We will leave your bloody body on your mama’s porch<br/>
Lord, born in the projects<br/>
Papa was a rolling stone, selling rock crack<br/>
Yeah, I grew up in my day<br/>
Making juugs on a phone with no contacts<br/>
I'm drinking Activas only know Hi-Tech<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Yo Tunes, pass the steel, or bash the steel<br/>
My passion real, I'm fashion ill<br/>
The pussy niggas are Massingil, mass appeal<br/>
My past is real before I had the deal, you dig?<br/>
Pies and cakes, out of state<br/>
Lies is fake, God don’t make mistakes<br/>
Got the girl pussy smelling like Codeine Syrup<br/>
Got the bands on me like a football field, I'm ill<br/>
I deserve a threesome for my birthday<br/>
If she pretty it's Magic City on the first date<br/>
Cup of lean and toast, yeah I’m ‘posed to boast<br/>
Goody Mo the quote, not many coming close<br/>
Trying to smoke what I never smoked before<br/>
Dream what I never dreamed before<br/>
Woke up and my Rolls sky high<br/>
I ride by, I drive by then hop out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ba-da-ba-da-beee<br/>
Ba-ba-da-bope<br/>

We got weed, that’s a lot of smoke<br/>
Yeah, that’s that loud I hope<br/>
We gotta lotta dope, we gotta lotta dope<br/>
Ba-ba-da-bope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Big dreams, big rings, big chains<br/>
Switch lanes, sip lean<br/>
Sixteen, seventeen, Medellin<br/>
Favorite color money green<br/>
A triple beam, a hundred Ps of sour Ds<br/>
A bunch of Ds, she can come suck on these, no suckas please<br/>
See I look like my daddy though<br/>
I get high, I get the munchies eating edible<br/>
If it’s available<br/>
Bitch you never know<br/>
Oyster Perpetual<br/>
Trapped at the Texaco like I’m OJ<br/>
Trying to put it in her mouth like Colgate<br/>
Ben Franklin, that’s my muthafuckin soul mate<br/>
Yea I need a mop, I got a new flo’ today<br/>
I’m sippin’ syrup like a got a fuckin’ cold today<br/>
I’m throwing tres up like Golden State<br/>
Old school the same color as Sidney Poitier<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne (2 Chainz):]</i><br/>
Ba-da-ba-da-beee<br/>
Ba-ba-da-bope<br/>
(Got a lot, got a lot)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ba-ba-da-bope<br/>
I said we gotta lotta dope<br/>
(Got a lot, got a lot) We gotta lotta coke<br/>
We got weed, that’s a lotta smoke<br/>
Yeah, that’s that loud I hope<br/>
