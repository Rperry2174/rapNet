Yeah, let me catch a motherfucking wave<br/>
I got a Chanel surfboard let me catch a wave<br/>
<br/>
Woke up this morning<br/>
Dick look like a flag pole<br/>
Gotta catch me a bad throat<br/>
Shit, 200 on the dash board<br/>
If you feeling froggy lil nigga gonna jump he still a lil tadpole<br/>
Yeah I move a little tad slow cause I'm sipping on the castro<br/>
<br/>
Here we go again<br/>
I drink a four again<br/>
Not going poor again<br/>
Young nigga supposed to win<br/>
I asked the Lord to forgive me<br/>
I asked the Jiggas for endearments<br/>
Diamonds for wife and the children<br/>
This is my life I'm a live it<br/>
<br/>
I got Jesus on my pendant<br/>
Been hustling since an appendix<br/>
When you look up I'm lieutenant<br/>
When you look up for attendance<br/>
Gucci sun all of my tennis<br/>
Make this shit look like a business<br/>
Make killers look like a witness<br/>
Make shopping look like a fitness<br/>
Ran the trap fuck the Olympics<br/>
You wasn't there you must missed it<br/>
I posted pics on my Insta<br/>
Don't you become a statistic<br/>
Don't you know I know logistics<br/>
Still got Riri on my wishlist<br/>
Your lady got me on her hit list<br/>
Don't think you gonna forget this<br/>
<br/>
Here we go again<br/>
I drink a four again<br/>
Not going poor again<br/>
Young nigga supposed to win<br/>
I asked the Lord to forgive me<br/>
I asked the Jiggas for endearments<br/>
Diamonds for wife and the children<br/>
This is my life I'm a live it<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know they like what's he saying<br/>
Spondivits, that's some south side shit<br/>
Some Atlanta shit, Virginia Avenue<br/>
I used to go up in there get me a bucket of crab legs, melted butter<br/>
But at the same time I got a jug in the parking lot though, you dig<br/>
Here we go again<br/>
I drink a four again<br/>
Not going poor again<br/>
Young nigga supposed to win<br/>
I asked the Lord to forgive me<br/>
I asked the Jiggas for endearments<br/>
Diamonds for wife and the children<br/>
This is my life I'm a live it<br/>
I tell em', I tell em' meet me over there by the Waffle House<br/>
I'm selling bags though no lil shit no poquito<br/>
<br/>
Muy grande, muy muy grande, plug talk<br/>
You muy poquito, me muy grande
