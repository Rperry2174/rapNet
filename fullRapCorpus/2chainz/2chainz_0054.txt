<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Last night I bought the supermodel<br/>
Got head on the way home<br/>
She left her other friends at the club<br/>
Got home, and I fucked her with my chains on<br/>
And that's ratchet huh?<br/>
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh<br/>
(Woah bring it back)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Take your bitch like I'm the dog catcher<br/>
Take your ass to the mall after<br/>
Spa day, shawty<br/>
Kill that pussy, pallbearer<br/>
You from that RuPaul era<br/>
I'm from that hell nah era<br/>
Real niggas say true<br/>
Real niggas ain't you<br/>
I ride around with that yapper on me<br/>
Gun clad with my Glock up on me<br/>
Surround your ass with so many shots<br/>
You'll be claustrophobic<br/>
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit<br/>
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish<br/>
My paper up, got your girl with her ankles up<br/>
Gangster boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
She got her T-shirt and her panties on<br/>
She trying to smell my cologne<br/>
I can fuck her anywhere I want<br/>
I even fuck her on the floor<br/>
And thats ratchet huh?<br/>
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh<br/>
(Woah bring it back)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm on top like a toup√©e<br/>
You on the side like a toothache<br/>
Box your ass, suitcase<br/>
I'm real, you ain't<br/>
Calamari, crab cakes<br/>
My closet the size of your damn place<br/>
You lookin' at a star<br/>
I wish that they could add space<br/>
I'm getting money, fast pace<br/>
My hoes gave my cash straight<br/>
He can't ball, castrate<br/>
She the opposite of last place<br/>
Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin<br/>
My girl got a big ass<br/>
Your girl got back pockets touching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I want a dollar, I want everything<br/>
Balls out, I let her hang<br/>
Went shopping for a wedding ring<br/>
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane<br/>
And thats ratchet huh?<br/>
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
If you patch a weed that's ratchet<br/>
My last album was classic<br/>
Shawty on my dica<br/>
Backwards spells acid<br/>
She pop a P like a zany<br/>
She'll use no hands and no panties<br/>
She rock like nose candy<br/>
You fuck with me, ain't no plan B<br/>
I'm a D boy with a degree<br/>
I sold dope in my momma's home<br/>
My girl pussy deep (deep)<br/>
So right there is my comfort zone<br/>
Born alone, die alone<br/>
Mud in my styrofoam<br/>
She got on top of me like a stage,<br/>
I said use my dick as a microphone
