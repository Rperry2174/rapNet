<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I keep my hoes in check, you buy Nike for yours<br/>
Say they want that loud, I'mma bring that noise<br/>
Check my watch on a flight, yeah, I call that airtime<br/>
Murk 'em in the middle of the street, that gon' be his deadline (tell 'em)<br/>
Yeah, you gon' respect mine, got a body on my Tec-9<br/>
Say you nobody 'till somebody gon' body you, flatline (BOW)<br/>
Pocket full of dead guys and you know I'm anti<br/>
Anti-social, anti-labor, anti-cool nigga, ain't I?<br/>
You looking at a star that's phased out, trying to take my style then take off<br/>
I go to work with no days off, everything I own paid off (Tru)<br/>
Shawty pussy hair shaved off and she did it just for me, nigga<br/>
Would skip you like a spacebar, but I much rather delete niggas (DAMN)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been? (Hold up)<br/>
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been? (Turn up)<br/>
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been? (Yeah)<br/>
I've been getting money, where the fuck you been? (I told her)<br/>
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in (I told her)<br/>
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in (I told her)<br/>
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in (tell 'em)<br/>
I've been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Gucci hat (Gucci hat), Gucci belt<br/>
If you wrote a autobiography you'd have to sue yourself<br/>
You lying ass, codeine in my wine glass<br/>
I know you had a wild past, I ain't fucked you in a while with your wild ass<br/>
I get high and I fly past, I don't know nothing 'bout iChat<br/>
I work in this iPhone they need an app called iTrap<br/>
I trap, shining like a night night lamp<br/>
I just hit my girlfriend and asked her where her wife at (tell 'em)<br/>
White cup, white hat, laying on a white couch (Tru)<br/>
Got that presidential and a residential white house<br/>
Nigga saying "who?" (who) like a white owl<br/>
You can see me shinin' (shinin') with the light out<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Cap-1]</i><br/>
Turn five to a ten to a twenty to fifty to hundred<br/>
My niggas get money, I want it (BEEP)<br/>
I ride through the city my niggas got choppers<br/>
My bitch she's so pretty that's my pocahontas<br/>
Everything on me I shine like a trophy<br/>
Run up a check while they watch out for police<br/>
Versace my pinky, a brick on my Rollie<br/>
The Cali Ferrari I'm feeling like Kobe<br/>
TRU to the death of me, nigga<br/>
Killers on the right and left of me, nigga<br/>
My destiny nigga to get all this money<br/>
I can't share that whole recipe with you, nigga (nah)<br/>
My nigga told me "get 'em" did it I got 'em<br/>
Stand on that couch, drink out of the bottle<br/>
That .40 got hollows, that bitch she gon' swallow<br/>
Get to the money I'm keeping Chicago (yeah)<br/>
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in (and what)<br/>
Bought the Benz just to fuck your friends<br/>
Giuseppe's 900 with that gold boss (Tru)<br/>
Everything 'bout me wrong like a dope charge (turn up)<br/>
<br/>
