<i>[Swae Lee:]</i><br/>
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do<br/>
(My Momma always said)<br/>
I said close your mouth and eat<br/>
You make some paper, than you make your own rules<br/>
(My Momma always said aye, damn)<br/>
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do<br/>
I said close your mouth and eat<br/>
You make some paper, than you make your own rules<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I'm from the hood, it's evident<br/>
Used to sell drugs at my residence<br/>
Stayed in section 8 with relatives<br/>
Opportunity knockin' I let them in<br/>
I don put voices on everything<br/>
I left them all like Ginobili<br/>
And if I'm not successful, ain't nobody gon come console me<br/>
I pray my momma quit smokin'<br/>
And my dad gotta get focused<br/>
I gotta table full of ace of spades<br/>
I don't fuck around with you jokers (ooh)<br/>
Ain't heard a word from my old friends<br/>
Heard they wanna kick my doors in<br/>
I done load up the 2-2-3<br/>
I'm so high they might call the goaltend, yeah<br/>
Lord knows, stash work in the console<br/>
So many autos in my garage, I can't open my car door<br/>
Ball on me like the Sun on me<br/>
Gettin' this bread she said dropped crumbs on me<br/>
Walked in the club and got ones only<br/>
Need a tat on my stomach that say prawns only<br/>
Raised by single parent Black Women<br/>
They call me Tity Boi cause she used to spoil me<br/>
She always told me<br/>
<br/>

Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do<br/>
(My Momma always said)<br/>
I said close your mouth and eat<br/>
You make some paper, than you make your own rules<br/>
(My Momma always said aye, damn)<br/>
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do<br/>
I said close your mouth and eat<br/>
You make some paper, than you make your own rules<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Smoking on a yacht, call me Ricky Steamboat<br/>
Bags full of gas, used to serve them through the screen door<br/>
Tryna flip a brick, Shaq at the free throw<br/>
Taught by Scarface, Brad Jordan, Al Pacino, wooo<br/>
No rules, most of my partnas homeschooled<br/>
Most of my partnas got charges<br/>
And I ain't talking about no mothafuckin' dodges<br/>
Trappin' up outta the college<br/>
I'm addicted to the rice at Benihana<br/>
Raised by a single parent black woman<br/>
They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me<br/>
She always told me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swae Lee:]</i><br/>
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
I said close your mouth and eat<br/>
You make some paper, than you make your own rules<br/>
(My Momma always said aye, damn)<br/>
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do<br/>
I said close your mouth and eat<br/>
You make some paper, than you make your own rules
