<i>[Hook: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Thank God for the first nigga started drinking<br/>
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping<br/>
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping<br/>
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em<br/>
I got a problem with these niggas<br/>
I got a problem with these bitches<br/>
Trigger finger keep itchin'<br/>
I pull it, I do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified<br/>
Time to go to work, no suit and tie<br/>
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' at the telly<br/>
My nigga did a dime and he back already<br/>
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already<br/>
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already<br/>
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already<br/>
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already<br/>
Three niggas with me, me myself and I<br/>
God don't like ugly, you should testify<br/>
My T-shirt come from bergdorf<br/>
I make so much from a verse I take a third off<br/>
Bird call, swerve off<br/>
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off<br/>
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball<br/>
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Drank in my cup, hope this shit don't spill<br/>
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill<br/>
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill<br/>
I have no imagination, everything I do for real<br/>
Bitch I'm camouflage down put your camera phone down<br/>
If she got an ass and the girl a fan, it's going down<br/>
I'mma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it<br/>
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it<br/>
In the bedroom forever that's what her roommate will tell you<br/>
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you<br/>
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Tell 'em come to the crib and do them both, double dribble<br/>
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her<br/>
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos<br/>
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes<br/>
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes<br/>
Tunechi...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
That's just how my OG would sum it up<br/>
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up<br/>
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though<br/>
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Well, if you know like I know that pussy pop like pyro<br/>
And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole<br/>
I’m colder than the snot nose, man all these hoes is my hoes<br/>
If she bougie fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes<br/>
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in<br/>
Niggas lying, they pretend<br/>
Don’t cross that line its paper thin<br/>
High as a star, make a wish<br/>
I’m a shark, I ate the fish<br/>
I got no heart, I hate that bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz]</i><br/>
You hate that bitch, well I hate that bitch<br/>
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard<br/>
Do a drive by while you’re riding on your skateboard<br/>
They ain't even know it<br/>
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet<br/>
Then I take her to the crib<br/>
Man fuck that bitch right on the step<br/>
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out<br/>
Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out<br/>
Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote<br/>
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope<br/>
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat<br/>
I am so cold I need a cover and a coat<br/>
Kick it at the mall, call it football<br/>
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3<br/>
Right now it's me time<br/>
A little time for myself, me time<br/>
Oh yeah, right now it's me time<br/>
Don't want no one else now, me time<br/>
Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone<br/>
Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone<br/>
Please, please don't stop by my home<br/>
No, no cause I feel it's just matter of time<br/>
Till you people make me lose my mind<br/>
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind<br/>
Right now it's me time<br/>
You need to go kick rocks now<br/>
Me time
