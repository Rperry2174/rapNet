I want a whip and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Why they done switched up the game?<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Hustled for whips and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Yeah we don't see it the same<br/>
This is a new generation<br/>
We ain't scared of shit<br/>
We ain't beg for shit<br/>
There's niggas dead for this<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Hustled for whips and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Yeah we don't see it the same<br/>
<br/>
Hustle in Rollie, you know it's time for that<br/>
Broken taillight, you can die for that<br/>
Ain't no <i>[?]</i>, ain't no hidin' that<br/>
Might put the whip and park that<br/>
Might walk around in camoflauge, strapped<br/>
Bitch poppin' like bra straps<br/>
Only Kappa steps with a signed petition<br/>
Told the governor to revise the system<br/>
My auntie, she reside in prison<br/>
Damn near did thirty flat<br/>
Nigga round here playin' with kids<br/>
Get out and go to Baby Gap<br/>
Can't respect it, won't respect it<br/>
Got ejected, check the checklist<br/>
Don't expect to get on the guest list<br/>
Got a necklace on a necklace<br/>
<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Why they done switched up the game?<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Hustled for whips and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Yeah we don't see it the same<br/>
This is a new generation<br/>
We ain't scared of shit<br/>
We ain't beg for shit<br/>
There's niggas dead for this<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Hustled for whips and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Yeah we don't see it the same<br/>
<br/>
1831 Exodus, prejudice, represent<br/>
Heaven-sent, Hell-bound<br/>
Jail-bound, necklace, hecklers, death wish<br/>
Yeah, preachin' today and kill you tonight<br/>
Nobody care how I'm feelin' tonight<br/>
This how I move in the middle of the night<br/>
Got all my people to get up and fight<br/>
Guess I'm a be the new villain tonight<br/>
Liftin' the spirits to Biblical heights<br/>
I talk to Christ so I'm feelin' him right<br/>
Nat with the Turner, that don't concern you<br/>
Stick it inside you, then I'm a turn you<br/>
Then I'm a learn you, then I'm a burn you<br/>
I got it on me like it's a thermal<br/>
<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Why they done switched up the game?<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Hustled for whips and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Yeah we don't see it the same<br/>
This is a new generation<br/>
We ain't scared of shit<br/>
We ain't beg for shit<br/>
There's niggas dead for this<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Hustled for whips and a chain<br/>
I want a whip and a chain<br/>
Yeah we don't see it the same
