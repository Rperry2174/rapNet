Everything I know <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
The streets have taught me everything I know <i>[x7]</i><br/>
The streets have taught me everything (I know)<br/>
<br/>
With my back against the wall ain't no pressure<br/>
When the defense really on, ain’t no test<br/>
Pull up real slow in a taxi<br/>
Gunshots turn em into athletes<br/>
I was hungry for a mil I gotta have it<br/>
Drove a couple couple cars up the mansion (Nah foreal at one time)<br/>
Smoked a whole seven sitting in the traffic<br/>
And niggas couldn't beat me if they practiced<br/>
Used to use my safe for a mattress<br/>
Used to use my mattress for a safe<br/>
See I could count a hundred thousand backwards (99, 98, 97.)<br/>
And I'm just tryna get it every day<br/>
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers <i>[x3]</i><br/>
And now your mall on that, shawty what’s happenin'<br/>
<br/>
The streets have taught me everything I know <i>[x7]</i><br/>
The streets have taught me everything<br/>
<br/>
Everything I know<br/>
Used to hustle at the store<br/>
Used to get it with my bros<br/>
Used to bet on tenfold<br/>
Now I'm all around the coast<br/>
I be all up on the pole<br/>
I be smokin' on that gas<br/>
It might make them bitches choke<br/>
Old school with the rallies<br/>
Used to meet them up at rallies<br/>
So it’s fuck your P<br/>
The streets have taught me how to get it (get it)<br/>
<br/>
The streets have taught me everything I know <i>[x7]</i><br/>
The streets have taught me everything (I know)<br/>
Everything I know
