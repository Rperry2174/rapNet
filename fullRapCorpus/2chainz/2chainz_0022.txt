<i>[Intro: DJ Drama]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I like to take it one day at a time<br/>
I like to take it one, ooh<br/>
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time<br/>
I like to take it one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Broken home, tell me what the fuck is wrong<br/>
Now I gotta charge a brick for a song<br/>
Trap guy, turned into a rap guy<br/>
No suit on but I still got trap ties<br/>
Argyles, pastels and some neckties<br/>
Shawty on the pill, X-file<br/>
40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised<br/>
And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs<br/>
Mama see the baby, this is karmasutra<br/>
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future<br/>
As far as the past, nevermind that<br/>
I don't know who's finer, you or this wine glass<br/>
And you must rewind that if you don't get it<br/>
Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what I'm eatin<br/>
My chromosomes read Georgia Dome<br/>
Icy watch, I don't mind spending time alone<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jadakiss]</i><br/>
Yo, get the clip out of the ashtray, put it in the air<br/>
Grab my cellphone, call my engineer<br/>
Yea, last night I was on one<br/>
Quick carwash, then I make a mall run<br/>
I'm a different brother<br/>
Louie store spending chips on some kicks I already got, different color<br/>
40 cally chrome, on deck<br/>
All the Kush gone, gotta collect<br/>
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone<br/>
30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick<br/>
Always hustle to get it<br/>
I never ask for shit<br/>
If it's family or money I might have to flip<br/>
I'm a say it if it's on my mind<br/>
I like to take it one day at a time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Never on the guest list<br/>
Always unexpected<br/>
In so many checks<br/>
I should make a checklist<br/>
Looking at these emcees' like they should make a deathwish<br/>
Got my girl in the kitchen, cooking ambidextrious<br/>
Left wrist, right wrist<br/>
Whip that, white bitch<br/>
This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to right this<br/>
Look at my hue blow, watch how the light hit<br/>
Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit<br/>
I done did the dollars up, die nigga<br/>
Too dehydrated to cry nigga<br/>
I was struggling, had a time limit<br/>
I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it<br/>
I wish that pussy had a sign in it<br/>
That said, "Warning: if you hit it then you mine nigga"<br/>
Damn, that crazy bitch on that crazy shit<br/>
If you don't make money it don't make sense<br/>
<br/>
