Yeah, my diamonds talking back, talking back, ya ya<br/>
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, they talking back, yeah yeah<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, boom pow pow<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, blaow blaow blaow<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they say "fuck y'all"<br/>
Rock Givenchy shoes like they All-Star<br/>
Say you turned 'em down it'd be old, dawg<br/>
Known to light it all like the ball park<br/>
Crib the same size as the Walmart<br/>
Yard so big I got a golf cart<br/>
Diamonds on me shining when you see 'em, boom bing<br/>
Diamonds on me shining when it's DM, boom bing bing<br/>
Diamonds on me dancing like it's Breezy over Eazy<br/>
I can buy a hundred easy, I just got a call from Jeezy<br/>
I count money too, I'm sleepy, ink on my body, graffiti<br/>
And you know I come from CP<br/>
Can't fuck no bitch with no VD, nah<br/>
Diamonds on me going bing bing bing bing<br/>
Diamonds on me doing their damn thing thing thing thing<br/>
Known to get head while the car park<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they say "fuck "y'all"<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, talking back, ya ya<br/>
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, they talking back, yeah yeah<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, boom pow pow<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, blaow blaow blaow<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they say, "Fuck 'ya'll"<br/>
Walk in to the VIP and yell, "Touchdown!"<br/>
Ain't wore the same shoes the whole month now<br/>
I am so high she told me come down<br/>
I'm like how, sip a loud, gun go pow<br/>
Mr. Chow, bling bling blow, bitches bow<br/>
Bitches bi, they liking girls and guys<br/>
I'll advised, got the Rollie winterized<br/>
When I die bury me beside the Cuban links<br/>
2 Chainz, a lot of Z's 'cause you niggas sleep<br/>
Pinky ring ping, index finger ping, middle finger ping<br/>
Whole lot of rings, whole lot of watches<br/>
Watches being ostrich, neck, wrist, faucets<br/>
Chain show 'em options<br/>
Rings so big you could go boxing<br/>
Diamonds talking back, yours ain't saying nothing<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, talking back, ya ya<br/>
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, they talking back, yeah yeah<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, boom pow pow<br/>
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, blaow blaow blaow
