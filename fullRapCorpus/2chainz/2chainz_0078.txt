<i>[Intro - Skooly:]</i><br/>
Same old bitches nigga... Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha... Wooo!<br/>
Same old females, same old females, same old females...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Skooly:]</i><br/>
Boy them same old females<br/>
Boy you know that they don't mean well<br/>
See I met her at Compound<br/>
And the next week I seen her at rehab<br/>
All these bitches know that I'm the shyt<br/>
Fuck it / Fucking can't tell me shyt<br/>
Bitch you can't tell me shyt<br/>
Nigga you can't tell me shyt<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Came from the bottom, but I survived<br/>
And just for the pain, I take OxyContin<br/>
Gave my dawg a watch to pass the time<br/>
And she be in New York half the time<br/>
When I drop the top, you see ashes flying<br/>
Walked in Onyx, seen asses flying<br/>
She told me that her number was classified<br/>
I said bitch, you should ask for mine!<br/>
Sippin' margaritas in Miami with my mamacita<br/>
All-Star Game, she was in the bleachers<br/>
Every time I see her, I say nice to meet ya<br/>
Had it in the room girl, underneath her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Cap 1:]</i><br/>
Met her at Live on Sunday<br/>
She was in Atlanta on Monday<br/>
Club going up on a Tuesday<br/>
Told her she can get it how she want it<br/>
I ain't picky, I ain't got a type<br/>
I'm single, I ain't got a wife<br/>
But if I hit you with the slow-stroke<br/>
I bet that you gonna spend the night<br/>
I bet you find another flight because she just wanna love the life<br/>
Seen her out in Cali, man in Vegas she was at the fight<br/>
Sunday at the rehab, beat the pussy made her relapse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
