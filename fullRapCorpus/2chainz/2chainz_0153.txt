<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Used to treat my mattress like the ATM, yeah<br/>
Bond number 9 that's my favorite scent, yeah<br/>
Can't forget that kush, I'm talking OG, yeah<br/>
Rest in peace to pop, he was an OG, alright now<br/>
285 I had that pack on me, uh<br/>
I cannot forget I had that strap on me, yeah<br/>
Rest in peace to my partner Doe<br/>
All we ever want to do was ball<br/>
That was the easy part, we playing that Weezy hard<br/>
We sit in the kitchen late, we tryna to make an escape<br/>
Tryna make me a mil, so I'm a keep me a plate<br/>
I told 'em shawty can leave, so I'm a keep me a rake<br/>
So I'm a keep me a Wraith, my jewelry look like a lake<br/>
Today I'm in a Maybach<br/>
And that car came with some drapes<br/>
You know I look like a safe, I put you back in your place<br/>
You know I look in your face, sing to your bitch like I'm Drake<br/>
2 Chainz!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Trap Choir:]</i><br/>
Good drank, big knots<br/>
Good stuff, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)<br/>
Drop top, no hot box<br/>
12 tried to pull me over, pink slips to the cops<br/>
She said the love give her thizz face<br/>
Put that thing in her rib cage<br/>
Whips out, Kunta Kinte<br/>
Diamonds clear like Bombay<br/>
Take your babies, no Harambe<br/>
Play with keys like Doc Dre<br/>
3K like André<br/>
And your girl, tell her come here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
It's Gucci!<br/>
Your trunk in the front<br/>
Well check this out my top in the trunk<br/>
You play with my money<br/>
Then check this out you're poppin' the trunk<br/>
Three mil in a month<br/>
But I just did three years on a bunk<br/>
Oh, you in a slump<br/>
I'm headed to Oakland like Kevin Da Runt<br/>
What is your point?<br/>
Square with the stamp, fuck Kevin Durant<br/>
Lay on my trap<br/>
Play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat<br/>
I'm taking the cheese and killing the rats<br/>
Gucci Mane, call me the cat with the racks<br/>
I'm swervin', but I'm in back of the 'Bach<br/>
Persian, man I got hoes from Iraq<br/>
I'm servin', I pay a bird for that<br/>
He nervous, I ain't got no word for that<br/>
He hurt and want all of his purses back<br/>
He mixing the syrup with the Percocets<br/>
She perfect and she got perky breasts<br/>
I just want some of that turkey neck<br/>
Trapper of the year, I'm from Bouldercrest<br/>
You snitch of the year cause you told the best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Trap Choir:]</i><br/>
Good drank, big knots<br/>
Good stuff, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)<br/>
Drop top, no hot box<br/>
12 tried to pull me over, pink slips to the cops<br/>
She said that molly give her thizz face<br/>
Put the thing in her rib cage<br/>
Whips out, Kunta Kinte<br/>
Diamonds clear like Bombay<br/>
Take your babies, no Harambe<br/>
Play with keys like Doc Dre<br/>
3K like André<br/>
And your girl, tell her come here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Favorite rapper, that's 3K<br/>
Yeah sir that's my DJ<br/>
Mike Dean on the piano<br/>
Put the work on the E-way<br/>
Guwop right next to me<br/>
So you know Bouldercrest with me<br/>
Man it's hard for you to mess with me<br/>
So you're looking at the best really<br/>
Diamonds dancing like Bentley<br/>
Might leave in a Bentley<br/>
Kinda hard to get with me<br/>
Can't believe it like Ripley<br/>
Pretty girls like trap music<br/>
Man I used to want a condo<br/>
Started off in the basement<br/>
Ended up on the top floor<br/>
Yeah, you listening to the top flow<br/>
Now you looking at the top tier<br/>
From grams to the Grammys<br/>
Told y'all it was our year<br/>
Told y'all it was my year<br/>
Told y'all it was my year<br/>
Told y'all it was my year<br/>
Man you looking at the evidence<br/>
Yeah God, that's my president<br/>
Hell nah, I don't hesitate<br/>
I ain't met a girl can curve me<br/>
Let a motherfucker set it straight, for real
