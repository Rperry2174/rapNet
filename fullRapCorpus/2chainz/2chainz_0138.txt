<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I'm on the cost pandemonium<br/>
Pick up the paper, custodian<br/>
This how I first met Apollonia<br/>
Tryna fill up California kings<br/>
Hydrocodone with the Visine<br/>
Master bedroom on the right wing<br/>
This a fill-leet not a bright lean<br/>
Fuck her to sleep she have pipe dreams<br/>
Yeah, this is the king of the trap<br/>
Yeah, I'm pulling straight out the hat<br/>
Yeah, everyone better take cover<br/>
Yeah, got rubbas under attack<br/>
Oh, my daughters inherit arrogance<br/>
And they intelligent, that's a fact<br/>
Bought me a car February first<br/>
You already know it was black on black<br/>
I cover my scars with the tats on tats<br/>
You better bag back rat-tat-tat-tat<br/>
I pass you a drug, better pass it back<br/>
I went to Montgomery, with packs in bags<br/>
Sent her to the store for some plastic bags<br/>
Sent her to the store for some rubber bands<br/>
I start a picture so easy<br/>
I thought it work till you underhand<br/>
Underworld, underground, underline<br/>
I'm underdog and you undermine<br/>
This here ain't no once upon a time<br/>
This really happen forreal<br/>
Can't even trust our own government<br/>
Awe man fuck all that humble shit<br/>
...<br/>
Man fuck all that mumble shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Realize<br/>
A lot of these niggas tell real lies<br/>
They not about shit in real life<br/>
And that's something that I had to realize (realize)<br/>
I had to reco-reco-reconig-i-ize it<br/>
(reco-reco-reconig-i-ize)<br/>
They see me winning and now they don't like it<br/>
(Yeah, I know they don't like it)<br/>
Act like the love me, but hate me in private<br/>
I had to reco-reco-reconig-i-ize it<br/>
<br/>
Yo<br/>
I went and copped the Range<br/>
I call this rock Dwayne<br/>
Johnson, stop the plane<br/>
Man, I cannot complain<br/>
I left my shades in Atlanta so I told my pilot to stop the plane<br/>
He busts a U in the air<br/>
She say she doin' it, where?<br/>
She wanna sit in my chair<br/>
But she can never be my heir<br/>
Checks, clear, Bible, swear<br/>
They ain't bugging I go off<br/>
Asahd Khaled with the cloth<br/>
Dwayne Carter of the north<br/>
Dwayne Wade in the fourth<br/>
New dream house for mommy<br/>
Keep 'Caiah in Armani<br/>
Putting my nieces through college<br/>
This for Kellise and Imani<br/>
Look at these niggas I put on<br/>
All of these niggas I'm good on<br/>
My own tour, I stood on<br/>
I swear the next one I'm keeping my foot on<br/>
I've been winning 8 years consistently<br/>
At least respeck it<br/>
Papoose wrote a Ether record<br/>
But I broke Aretha record<br/>
See this is chess, not checkers<br/>
You can not check the checkers<br/>
Did Nas clear that Ether record?<br/>
Nah, but I broke Aretha record<br/>
<br/>
Realize<br/>
A lot of these niggas tell real lies<br/>
They not about shit in real life<br/>
And that's something that I had to realize (realize)<br/>
I had to reco-reco-reconig-i-ize it<br/>
(reco-reco-reconig-i-ize)<br/>
They see me winning and now they don't like it<br/>
(Yeah, I know they don't like it)<br/>
Act like the love me, but hate me in private<br/>
I had to reco-reco-reconig-i-ize it
