My height man,<br/>
OK, I got you!<br/>
I got you, don't worry<br/>
And I pay, I pay my height man!<br/>
Just pay me attention!<br/>
So you wanna do it for me <i>[?]</i><br/>
You've got make sure my <i>[?]</i><br/>
I got you, I got you<br/>
OK!<br/>
Guess who's gonna play those <i>[?]</i><br/>
All right, cool, all right!<br/>
My rhyme style real nonchalant<br/>
Trust me, rude boy this ain't what you want<br/>
He <i>[?]</i> have you doing summersaults<br/>
Then I dump ya trash ass off in the garbage<br/>
Every week I get my car washed<br/>
This the life of a hustle, this is not a fassaud<br/>
And what you're looking at is not a mirage<br/>
You probably seen me at the W having a minage<br/>
Performing, smack a lil ass recording<br/>
I'm doing 160 for my niggas in Porsches<br/>
They say I speeding cause I'm on that far left side<br/>
I'm from the South but I'm smoking on the West Side<br/>
I'm in my best right,<br/>
I let my girl wash clothes on the G4<br/>
So I could let em jet dry.<br/>
And I'm the best I noticed<br/>
And u ain't even noticed, until I roll up on in a Lotus<br/>
Brushing dust on my shoulders like fuck it I'm focus<br/>
I'm fucking with bitches, that's only fucking with soldiers<br/>
Listen! I got an old school the color of okra<br/>
The tires as wide as Oprah watch it when it approaches<br/>
Now listen, peace up! A town down you know I gotta my piece up<br/>
So I won't play around<br/>
Got the extra round!<br/>
Plus it got a clip on<br/>
Pollute ya block I put all that shit on! 2 Chainz...
