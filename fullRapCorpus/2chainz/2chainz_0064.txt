<i>[Hook - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
You a wuda cuda shuda ass nigga, ole' wuda cuda shuda ass nigga <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I woulda went there with y'all, I woulda got me a rental<br/>
I coulda stunt in the club, I could fuck every ho in the building<br/>
I shoulda got me a plaque, I should get me more attention<br/>
No, you should shut the fuck up, and leave all the bitchin' to bitches<br/>
(Wuda cuda shuda ass nigga, ole' wuda cuda)<br/>
(Wuda cuda shulda ass nigga, ole', ole, ole')<br/>

<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
She in stilettos she walkin’ all pigeon toed<br/>
Really though, when it come to gettin’ dough<br/>
If you listen to me I’m so underground<br/>
You have to sit on the floor<br/>
Ow, I just thought I’d seen a spaceship<br/>
Right, Right past my airline<br/>
Everybody know I dumps that<br/>
White girl like Kevin Federline<br/>
Don’t pay me no nevermind<br/>
These niggas is buggin’, pesticide<br/>
I count money in my spare time<br/>
Just paid a hundred dollars for a hairline<br/>
Label talkin’ bout what they woulda did<br/>
Bet they hustle me and you could be a winner<br/>
Girl you eat more pussy than me?<br/>
Girl you shoulda been a nigga<br/>
Pockets fillin' up like Lymph nodes<br/>
Been a go-getter from the get go<br/>
Always talkin' bout what you was finna do<br/>
Damn broad thought that you were finna get dough<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Boosie:]</i><br/>
You a wuda cuda shuda ass hater<br/>
Wanna be a man so bad homie<br/>
They ain't wanna see me get free<br/>
If you could you would have caught the stand on me<br/>
If I would have shook your hand, I would have been your boy<br/>
Now you extra hot since I dun hit your broad<br/>
Now you talk a nine, boss spark a nine<br/>
You prolly would shoot somethin' if you had some heart<br/>
That Bentley come from exotic rentals<br/>
Gotta go back Sunday, so you flat broke Monday<br/>
Probably could go spend 200 on somethin'<br/>
If you was gettin' Boosie money<br/>
You in King of Diamonds throwin' counterfeit<br/>
You might as well gon' pussy pop on the stage<br/>
All these rappers lyin' on records<br/>
O-M-G Hip-Hop-Hooray!<br/>
And you probably woulda been up in my video<br/>
But that was 'fore I went in<br/>
Ain't even write me no letter<br/>
You a wuda shuda cuda ass friend, busta!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
