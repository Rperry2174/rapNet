36<br/>
That’s how many ounces in a brick<br/>
36, 36, 36, 36<br/>
That’s how many ounces in a brick<br/>
That’s how many ounces in a brick<br/>
36<br/>
<br/>
Whip that shit, whip my wrist<br/>
I might whip your bitch if she ain’t with that shit<br/>
Young whippersnapper, I might eat that snapper<br/>
Got a yellow bitch, gotta whip them at ya<br/>
All I know is soda bakin’<br/>
All them other niggas fakin’<br/>
Watch them niggas fall to pieces<br/>
All them other niggas flaky<br/>
Did it for my city sellin’ crack out my building<br/>
Now I ride around with a crack in the ceiling<br/>
Exhale, Ziplock, flip-flop with them burglar doors<br/>
Yeah, I got that hard work<br/>
Nigga, you are unemployed<br/>
Residue all on the floor<br/>
Just made a mil so you know that’s what I’m hungry for<br/>
Get it how you live<br/>
<br/>
36<br/>
That’s how many ounces in a brick<br/>
36, 36, 36, 36<br/>
That’s how many ounces in a brick<br/>
That’s how many ounces in a brick<br/>
36
