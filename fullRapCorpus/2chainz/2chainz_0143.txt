It's at least 100 degrees, sweating like a fool<br/>
Aiight...<br/>
Young Juice, ay, ay, okay, okay<br/>
By any means I gotta get it<br/>
You can sleep when you die, point blank, period<br/>
No excuse for this, you only get one life<br/>
You only get once chance<br/>
You can get more wives<br/>
You can get more ice, you can get more cars<br/>
Nigga listen to what I'm saying, I'm a real superstar..<br/>
<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I got too many watches on my arm<br/>
I got too much shit goin' on<br/>
I got your favorite stripper on my phone<br/>
I got a bank account, got another bank account<br/>
Got another bank account, to be continued<br/>
Hibachi my menu, my bracelet on igloo<br/>
Every song is a single, you hear how the money talk<br/>
I may be bilingual, I pour out a liter, I light up the reefer<br/>
I'm back to charging niggas 100 a feature, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Hard work beats talent<br/>
Dope boy meets talent<br/>
Don P and eat salad<br/>
Walking around, my feet Bally<br/>
Sisquo and St. Ives<br/>
Six guns, eight knives<br/>
Potato on the barrel of it<br/>
Make you niggas hate fries<br/>
Been poppin' wheelies since 14<br/>
Sleeping with them, in them since 14<br/>
Ready to take one for the team<br/>
Ain't no discount, if ain't the one, we got a miscount<br/>
I am the truth, lil' nigga, shooting bullets from the booth, lil' nigga<br/>
Boom<br/>
<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
You too concerned with others<br/>
This for the single mothers<br/>
Might have a millionaire<br/>
Moving through Riverdale<br/>
Jacket on Rick Flair<br/>
Watch on Rick Flair<br/>
James Brown with the slick hair<br/>
Watch how she dance on it, dance on the work<br/>
If the pussy squirt, put her name in a verse<br/>
I am so high, I'm scared to jump<br/>
Keep the gas on me, I'm prepared to pump, alright<br/>
<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die<br/>
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes<br/>
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah
