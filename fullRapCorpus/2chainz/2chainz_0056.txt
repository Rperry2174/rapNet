<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Every cents huffy, pockets on husky<br/>
Shawty don't trust me, I break hearts often<br/>
If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher<br/>
From a dishwasher to a kingpin<br/>
Remember how the scene end and how this thing is<br/>
Drugs backed in 'em mean them things in<br/>
Now it's duffle bags full of green <i>[?]</i><br/>
I swear I ain't lying and my daddy hand died<br/>
He tell you he had the hood like a ring did<br/>
Two kids later, I mature like fine wine in the basement<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, different kind of pinot<br/>
Tried to stack c-note after c-note<br/>
I'm tryna make it count like a free throw after free throw<br/>
Line, it's a thin one between<br/>
Getting high and committing crimes<br/>
Let a nigga live<br/>
I've been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick<br/>
(Fuck this shit)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I remember when I believed in me<br/>
What am I supposed to do?<br/>
Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me<br/>
They want a verse or to<br/>
Shit, what am I supposed to do?<br/>
Put 'em in a fucking herse or two<br/>
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too<br/>
And I smoke just to ease the pain<br/>
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain<br/>
Well at least until the pizza came<br/>
Or at least until polices came<br/>
Undercovers outside my momma yard<br/>
And all the guns is in Kisha's name<br/>
In Jesus's name I pray<br/>
I say that a couple times a day<br/>
When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay<br/>
And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I heard my little big cousin mad at me<br/>
I call him little big cause he younger than me<br/>
But he big, he was the high school team captain<br/>
Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen<br/>
And whatever happen that was the worst day<br/>
And who know what was going on in the first place<br/>
I love and helped raise my nigga<br/>
This shit forgot to call him on his birthday<br/>
It's hard to explain my new lifestyle<br/>
A partner lockdown, got a phone and an ipod<br/>
He called to tell me happy new years<br/>
I had to tell him nigga, it's march<br/>
We had similar stars<br/>
But I ain't figured his part<br/>
They had dough and we didn't<br/>
How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer<br/>
This is the outroduction<br/>
Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture
