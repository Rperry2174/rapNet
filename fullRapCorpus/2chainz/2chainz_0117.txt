Uh let me get a caesar salad, please, with croutons and codeine dressing, and a diet codeine. On a codeine diet. I get all that shit, I get back on that shit<br/>
<br/>
When I get out the bed, I grind, I hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Did it before and I'll do it again<br/>
Did it before, I'ma do it again<br/>
Did it before, I'ma do it again<br/>
Do it again<br/>
<br/>
Been 'posed to stop drinkin'<br/>
Pocket full of Ben Franklins<br/>
Y'all niggas been hatin'<br/>
Balmain mixtape<br/>
Surround the booth with yellow tape<br/>
Zip the kush then meditate<br/>
Your ladder straight, you featherweight<br/>
You heavyweight, it's Saturday<br/>
Gladiator, tell your neighbor<br/>
Gun on table, Buick LeSabre<br/>
Do you now, do you later<br/>
Dice game, pool table<br/>
Two flavors, too anxious<br/>
Got to kill these niggas<br/>
I don't feel these niggas<br/>
Them some stealin' niggas<br/>
Them lil' bitty niggas<br/>
On Peter St. at my buildin'<br/>
Nigga, Keisha's daycare was half a million, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Did it before and I'll do it again<br/>
Did it before, I'ma do it again<br/>
Did it before, I'ma do it again<br/>
Did it before<br/>
<br/>
Fell off, came up<br/>
Fell off, came back up<br/>
Pulled a doolie in Magic parkin' lot<br/>
Came back up<br/>
Go to the dough door don't get searched<br/>
Don't have to pay<br/>
Walk in, get ones, order wings<br/>
Nigga, this the A<br/>
AP, Hublot, Patek, Rollie, gold teeth<br/>
Niggas stealin' so much sauce<br/>
Them niggas damn near stole me<br/>
They stole the swag and they stole my license<br/>
You don't know about my sacrifices<br/>
Today I worked out on my triceps<br/>
Bought a room just to shoot dice in<br/>
Whip same color Cicely Tyson<br/>
Smokin' gas one of my original vices<br/>
Made a mil' off my phone devices<br/>
Listen to your own advices<br/>
I'm laid up, but I'm prayed up<br/>
You a handful, you a A cup<br/>
Might rock a jersey and a Jacob<br/>
Y'all young niggas need to wake up<br/>
<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Get out the bed and grind and hustle<br/>
Did it before and I'll do it again<br/>
Did it before, I'ma do it again<br/>
Did it before, I'ma do it again<br/>
Did it before
