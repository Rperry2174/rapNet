<i>[Intro - D'banj:]</i><br/>
Stutterin’<br/>
Givin’em rest and makin’ love again<br/>
In my best I be the run again<br/>
And I have the man dem stutterin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - D'banj:]</i><br/>
I'm getting this nigga in the morning<br/>
He gon takin even chiefin' just too long way<br/>
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings<br/>
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz - Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah! Okay I'm chillin' in my camo<br/>
Flippin' through the channels<br/>
On my G.O.O.D Music shit, my logo's a Lambo<br/>
Four doors of ammo, this ammunition I'm pitching<br/>
Will make your body, switch another postion<br/>
Listen, my weed loud, fuck her and speed off<br/>
Tell em I bare arms, I'm cuttin my sleeves off<br/>
Lettin my tats show and I sag my pants<br/>
I'm letting my ass show, I'm hot as tabasco<br/>
I study, Castro, yeah, my plug from Cuba<br/>
Inside the car is like a damn computer<br/>
Inside the crib is like a damn museum<br/>
You ain't seen these before, you better get em on film<br/>
Tryin to take these fat pockets, man your chances are slim<br/>
Disrespect: you stomp em out, man give em a Tim<br/>
You ain't did what I did, see I know I'mma win<br/>
And they don't have slow-motion so I did it again<br/>
Woah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz - Verse 2:]</i> <br/>
Okay I'm sitting on the plane<br/>
Flying over graves<br/>
I'm so high, nigga I could talk to rain<br/>
My outfits insane, ain't that evident?<br/>
My chain had another chain like it was pregnant<br/>
My favorite dish is turkey lasagna<br/>
Even my pajamas designer<br/>
She got a fat ass I make her rewind<br/>
Back seat so big I press recline<br/>
Got a dirty sprite in my cup holder<br/>
Rappers like road kill<br/>
They get run over, they get done over<br/>
Its just one solider<br/>
This flow will make you fall like its October<br/>
Me and your girl, nigga opposite of sober<br/>
Celine Paris chain charm look like a cobra<br/>
Young Casanova, Baby Romeo<br/>
I got my girl geeked, she look like she from 'Tokyo'<br/>
<br/>
