Listen to fuck niggas<br/>
Let em' know I'm still up in here been poppin'<br/>
Do so many shows in arenas<br/>
My nigga I need me a locker<br/>
Look at my car, how did they get on them sixes<br/>
This flow come from Drizzy, he got it from Migos<br/>
They got it from Three 6<br/>
Look at my bitches, look at my wrists<br/>
Realest nigga in the game<br/>
My nigga ain't no counterfeitted<br/>
Bitches is thick and delicious, doing they dishes<br/>
100 million on my wishlist<br/>
Taking penitentiary chances<br/>
Just to drink lean in them benzes<br/>
2 Chainz!<br/>
I want my trapback, I said that I want my trapback<br/>
I'm from the apartments, used to walk around with work in my backpack<br/>
G's all up in that shit<br/>
G's all up in that bitch<br/>
Truck calling me by my government<br/>
Running shit, gunning shit, shopping in London and loving it<br/>
<br/>
Okay first of all, I needed someone- shut your mouth<br/>
I'm sorry what did you just say?<br/>
I think we've had enough here, shut your mouth<br/>
Shut your mouth, will you shut your mouth?<br/>
You're just coming off as stupid<br/>
I'm coming off as stupid?<br/>
You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms<br/>
Please leave this office, we're done with this interview<br/>
Do we get any sort of souvenir?<br/>
Get out of my office!<br/>
<br/>
I want my trap back, I said I want my trap back<br/>
They say that money talk<br/>
Nigga so you already know that I want my cash back<br/>
You niggas ain't talking about shit, Harley Levine<br/>
You would've thought that there was some kilos on my bus<br/>
But they didn't find a thing<br/>
Hair looking like Brillo, my flow Armadillo<br/>
Catch me from class, belted with Versace all in my pillow<br/>
I bet I seen a kilo, the dope my hero<br/>
Remember I had that Box Chevy I set that bitch on some three zeros<br/>
You know that I'm rocking Buscemi, Adam and Ross, Auschemi<br/>
Her head is cold my nigga I think she that gonna need a beanie<br/>
Rolling and smoking zucchini, dropping the top on the whips<br/>
Making them look like bikinis<br/>
I am now balling so hard<br/>
I should be on my own box of Wheaties
