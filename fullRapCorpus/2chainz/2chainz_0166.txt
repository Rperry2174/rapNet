<br/>
Irma a problem like arithmetic<br/>
Still won't show a bitch shit but dick, yeah<br/>
I have sex with my necklace on<br/>
By the time breakfast done I'll extra gone, yeah<br/>
Niggas know I got a special flow<br/>
When they come to the crib they leave their shoes at the door, oh<br/>
Tity Boi they call me deuce for short<br/>
I just had an accident now I'm on Kush support<br/>
If I say it then I did it, I did it then I mean it<br/>
This is not a hand me down when I give niggas the bizness<br/>
2 black cars on 24 inches<br/>
That's my first 48 I'm killing these niggas<br/>
