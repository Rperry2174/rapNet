Me and my niggas are about to fuck the city up<br/>
I dropped 20 bands early just to get the Bentley Truck<br/>
We walked in the blue flame, there was like 10 of us<br/>
They were calling my name, they were like: "Tity Boi"<br/>
We were trying to lay low like we had something on us<br/>
And me and Cap-1 looked like we got 10 on us<br/>
We don't have to rent no bus, we don't have to rent no <i>[?]</i><br/>
I know bands was slowing down but nothing is picking up<br/>
You ain't whip a brick enough, your old girl ain't thick enough<br/>
And if you ain't got a mil in cash, you ain't rich enough<br/>
All these niggas switching up, all these niggas bitching up<br/>
Even if they was drowning, they know not to reaching us<br/>
Trying to make a speaker bus, riding in a diesel truck<br/>
Teachers tried to preaching us but they wasn't deep enough<br/>
Only thing you had for dinner was a blunt and piece of that<br/>
Only thing you had for dessert was a fucking Reese's <i>[?]</i><br/>
See, I'm the dean of The Real U<br/>
My girl working at the spot said she don't feel you<br/>
I wanna fuck her and I want her too<br/>
I need pussy rehab, nigga what about you?<br/>
Pussy rehab? Pussy rehab! <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is part 2 and I can't go no further<br/>
Until Gucci come home and put a verse up in this motherfucker<br/>
I'm out!
