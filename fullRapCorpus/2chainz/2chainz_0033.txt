<i>[Intro: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Let's play big bank take little bank<br/>
You are looking at a shark in a fish tank<br/>
When I'm in the kitchen, I make plenty cash<br/>
Tell shawty come here, she got plenty ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine<br/>
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
First I back back, Louie backpack<br/>
Where's Paris Hilton? Where's Kat Stacks?<br/>
I'm Rambo with this ammunition, my camo come from Tru Religion<br/>
Them broke hoes can't pay attention, your cutie missing, New Edition<br/>
Mr. Telephone man, there's something wrong with my line<br/>
When I call my baby's number, I get a click every time<br/>
Every line is dope, you can snort it<br/>
Working in the pot, I can make you do aerobics<br/>
I'm haterphobic, they mad cause I'm winning<br/>
They busy high and catching, mad cause I'm pinching<br/>
All my bitches different, all my diamonds glistening<br/>
My weed so loud, everybody listen<br/>
They say it's for the birds, so I bought a kilo<br/>
My Boost Mobile chirping, it must be my amigo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine<br/>
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
2 Chainz, you fucking crazy, motherfuckers know I'm fucking crazy<br/>
Fuck wrong with these bitches lately?<br/>
Bitches better get on they knees and praise me<br/>
Bitch, I rep that rich gang. Where's Stunna? Where's Wayne?<br/>
That's red on my wristband, SB, Mack Maine<br/>
Tell Tyga, lookin' for this bitch called Blac Chyna<br/>
Take a nigga bitch in a hot flash, menopause hot flash<br/>
Yes that's why I'm crowned queen, and I ain't lookin' for the prom king<br/>
These hoes' careers ain't promising, killing these bitches - crime scene<br/>
Oh, that's how a bitch do it<br/>
Fifty black trucks gone follow when I pull up<br/>
This shit hit you in the chin like a pull up<br/>
My door so cocky, my door so stuck up<br/>
Oh, hop up out the space car<br/>
Bitches stay pressed, I call them a space bar<br/>
Man I wish a bitch would, hundred-thousand dollar engine,<br/>
I wish a bitch could<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
Yeah, I luv dem strippers<br/>
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine<br/>
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Wait I don't even think these niggas understood what the fuck I just said<br/>
I said, hundred-thousand dollar engine<br/>
I wish a bitch could, like the little engine that could<br/>
2 Chainz!
