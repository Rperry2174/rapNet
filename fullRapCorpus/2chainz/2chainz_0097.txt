My mind for the intellectual<br/>
Had sex with her on my sectional<br/>
Slowed it down, take it extra slow<br/>
Bust on myself like plexi co<br/>
Oh alright here I go<br/>
Shorty got my love in the finger fold<br/>
I got a manicure, pedicure<br/>
I got her hair done and credit card new<br/>
I'm balling on her big time<br/>
Told shorty I'm 6'5"<br/>
Stand up on my bankroll, make me look like I'm 6'9"<br/>
She look like she been fine<br/>
She always call me big time<br/>
Pinky ring on, you should see the way I sip wine<br/>
I'm maestro in the main suite<br/>
Make a side chick out your main squeeze<br/>
Better hop on board 'fore the train leave<br/>
Shorty outta place cause I slang D<br/>
And I'm changes need my chain freeze<br/>
Meant to say my chain froze<br/>
Everytime I change clothes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Betty Idol:]</i><br/>
Cherish the game<br/>
When we fly far away<br/>
Sky dive in a puddle of mud<br/>
Make it rain blue dolphin<br/>
All I see is blue dolphin<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I like when she smile<br/>
She like when I make her smile<br/>
She like when I put it down<br/>
She like when I come in town<br/>
I like when she on the brown<br/>
She like when I'm on the loud<br/>
Seen her take some coke then smile<br/>
Seen her take a perc then pow<br/>
Birkin bag see no salt<br/>
All on the beach with toes out<br/>
All on the beach sea gulls out<br/>
All in the jeep windows down<br/>
Where I come from the Regals out<br/>
She knows I turn up on the molly<br/>
She doing string thing for money<br/>
I'm trying to put it in her tummy<br/>
I might whisper in her earlobe<br/>
I'm blowing kisses in her earlobe<br/>
I'm telling things she ain't built for<br/>
Money long as Lincoln Continentals<br/>
Codeine with a touch of Sprite<br/>
Geeked up for a hundred nights<br/>
I'm a roll had a Cuban link<br/>
In a figaro this a finger roll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Betty Idol:]</i><br/>
Cherish the game<br/>
When we fly far away<br/>
Sky dive in a puddle of mud<br/>
Make it rain blue dolphin<br/>
All I see is blue dolphin<br/>
<br/>
Cherish the game<br/>
When we fly far away<br/>
Sky dive in a puddle of mud<br/>
Make it rain blue dolphin<br/>
All I see is blue dolphin
