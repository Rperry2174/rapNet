<i>[Intro/Chorus: The Lox]</i><br/>
<br/>
Can I live til my last day<br/>
Hittin honies that be na-sty<br/>
Gettin money in the fast way<br/>
And I only care halfway<br/>
But I still can't let you pass me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Lox]</i><br/>
Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats<br/>
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats<br/>
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation<br/>
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation<br/>
When we do our shit we do our shit for real<br/>
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats<br/>
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill<br/>
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit<br/>
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get<br/>
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit<br/>
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years<br/>
Gang not, but we been had our black tears<br/>
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got<br/>
Underground, all above must get shot<br/>
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners<br/>
to all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all<br/>
<br/>
You already know what it's about when I run up in your house<br/>
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch<br/>
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance<br/>
I give this faggot a french kiss<br/>
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints<br/>
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since<br/>
You know about life after kicked the kid in<br/>
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams<br/>
Scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en<br/>
Either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron<br/>
Lox and Poppa, turning niggaz into Jim Hoffa<br/>
Who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper<br/>
You gettin money or your runnin from the Feds<br/>
Ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head<br/>
And I solemnly swear<br/>
That all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Lox]</i><br/>
Before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down<br/>
The flow like water get deepe and you drown<br/>
with no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough<br/>
Even the small Dunn got a little black hole<br/>
Your destiny is somethin you can never figure out<br/>
Niggaz is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth<br/>
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?<br/>
A lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?<br/>
Live with it got money you better get with it<br/>
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it<br/>
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it<br/>
Advice from the wise, slice the pies<br/>
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide<br/>
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb<br/>
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor<br/>
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, uhh<br/>
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?<br/>
My Desert Ease make MC's freeze<br/>
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams<br/>
You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and<br/>
realizin, a fist fight would be asinine<br/>
You just pop wines I must pop nines<br/>
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece<br/>
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up<br/>
We can hook up, all I see is the future<br/>
Disrespect, I shoot ya<br/>
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly<br/>
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak<br/>
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet<br/>
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep<br/>
I be the mob fiance, about to marry it<br/>
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics<br/>
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom<br/>
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like<br/>
my first LP, beef with me is unhealthy<br/>
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or<br/>
collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung<br/>
For them homos, still doin promos<br/>
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'<br/>
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat til fade]</i>
