<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Nigga was motherfuckin HYPED UP<br/>
Nigga just grabbed the nigga, snuffed the nigga<br/>
and it was on from there<br/>
The motherfucker there wasn't nuttin stoppin him<br/>
(What what did the rest of his niggaz do?)<br/>
Man the motherfuckers was just ready for anything<br/>
Them niggaz was packin burners<br/>
Them niggaz was ready to fight<br/>
whatever we had to do holmes<br/>
Niggaz was on the real flipout holmes<br/>
It was just comin out like a motherfucker<br/>
The nigga amped be like COME ON, COME ON MOTHERFUCKER!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Come on motherfuckers, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[samples play over second half of chorus]</i><br/>
"Man what you fuck doin over here?"<br/>
"Are you awake now?"<br/>
"Hell yah I'm awake man;<br/>
now tell me what the fuck is goin on here"<br/>
"Looks like the competition stopped by<br/>
to pay us a little visit, and check us out"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sadat X]</i><br/>
Let's go deep into the phrase, beautiful sunrays<br/>
off the baldhead, everything is real<br/>
Biggie me put on this joint so I'ma be the big wheel<br/>
Watch it Slim, hey Dad, place yo' bet on seven<br/>
Peace to one-oh-six, one-oh-eight, one-to-the-hundred-eleventh<br/>
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn<br/>
with 22's in your shoes, yo keep the shank ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Uhhh well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat<br/>
Release the BRAINSTORM, to make your motherfuckin BRAIN WARM<br/>
A strange form, somethin kind of lyrical<br/>
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual<br/>
Well "In God We Trust", guns I bust<br/>
Got that disgustin, sewer style dumpin<br/>
and that uhh <i>[singin]</i> do you knowwwwww, where you're goin to<br/>
Do you like the things that I bring?<br/>
<i>[rappin]</i> Make an emcee wanna sing for a livin<br/>
Take the beatdown we fuckin givin, c'mon motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sadat X]</i><br/>
What? Niggaz want drama, puttin work on my block<br/>
when I told y'all last week, that shit was too hot<br/>
Sellin pieces and treys, cuts my dimes<br/>
Somebody gon' get paid, somebody block get sprayed<br/>
Reaction is delayed as y'all run down the block<br/>
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts<br/>
Hey yo Biggie tell these niggaz I'ma hit em where it hurts<br/>
The big city it don't spare no bodies<br/>
Call me papichulo, to all the spanish mamis<br/>
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or fo' stouts<br/>
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses<br/>
Hey yo money that's yo' stock, yo Bigs pass the glock<br/>
I'ma tell him it can happen, don't play me with that rap shit<br/>
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Uhh<br/>
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight, .38's<br/>
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's, the shits never end<br/>
You can't touch my riches<br/>
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches<br/>
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht<br/>
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks<br/>
HAH, that's how I got the weed spot<br/>
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the landspread<br/>
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body<br/>
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas<br/>
I tote guns, I make number runs<br/>
I give emcees the runs drippin;<br/>
when I throw my clip in the A.K., I slay from far away<br/>
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K<br/>
My slow flows remarkable<br/>
Peace to Matteo<br/>
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello<br/>
That's crazy blunts, mad L's<br/>
My voice excels from the avenue to jailcells<br/>
Oh my God I'm droppin shit like a pigeon<br/>
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening<br/>
So you better grab your pistol<br/>
cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fuckin shit spill<br/>
And I'm talkin bout buckets, why did I have to do it?<br/>
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it<br/>
Cause I got mo' shots to pop-ya<br/>
Big Pop-pa, breakin you off somethin proper<br/>
Signin off is the hardcore rap singer<br/>
a.k.a. crack slinger, bring it anytime nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
