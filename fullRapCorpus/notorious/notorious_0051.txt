<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man<br/>
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can<br/>
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker<br/>
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker HEAR??<br/>
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras<br/>
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin HER<br/>
The raw rapper, spine snapper<br/>
with the little hookers on my lap-ah<br/>
You know the flavor Mack-ah<br/>
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin comforter<br/>
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin her<br/>
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her<br/>
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her<br/>
<i>[singing]</i> Why you wanna.. play your games on me<br/>
<i>[rapping]</i> Bitch, you crazy?<br/>
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit<br/>
Rest with the niggaz on that real bloodspill shit<br/>
My rap-pin tac-tics are drastic<br/>
Stretchin motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic<br/>
So if you wanna see my pedigreeeee<br/>
You better be, filled with energy, niggaz never gettin me<br/>
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Craig Mack]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hahhhh, AHHHHHHHH HAH<br/>
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(Hahhhh boyeeeee, let me get down and funk em)<br/>
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(Yeah.. uh-huh.. yeah)<br/>
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(Yo I just wanna get em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[G-Dep]</i><br/>
Yeah, yo<br/>
Odds even, said shoot (blaow)<br/>
Asked me the reason, and I said loot<br/>
Man that's all I'm here for, therefore<br/>
when death declares war, you know what to prepare for<br/>
Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta<br/>
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya<br/>
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool<br/>
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school<br/>
Rap terror, shots through your new era<br/>
Get it together, y'all niggaz shoulda knew better<br/>
I'm on point like acupuncture<br/>
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya<br/>
Left side, right side, witcha hoe I might slide<br/>
Runnin wit this big guy, y'all niggaz is pranksters<br/>
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound<br/>
and show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground<br/>
Just let me get down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Craig Mack]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(What? What?)<br/>
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(I just wanna funk a little bit)<br/>
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(Hahh.. I just wanna funk, what? Ahhhh)<br/>
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Missy]</i><br/>
I be like WHAAAAT? Let me clear my throat<br/>
Break the smoke, Missy gotta hit some high notes<br/>
HEYYYYYY!  Yo from coast to coast I burn like toast<br/>
So dope that I floats through snow nig-guh<br/>
Oh, you don't wanna bow to me<br/>
The agony be like, "Somebody help me please!"<br/>
Feel my pressure, never could a bitch flow better<br/>
in any weather, I'm Biggie bangin ya nigga<br/>
Ah-huh, I used to be the chick to lick the lollipop<br/>
Now I pop through your body parts<br/>
BLAOW, BLAOW, you like the way I interact<br/>
Proceed to smack, any MC that's wack<br/>
Ah-huh, microphone check one two<br/>
I do ya tool, like them freaks run through your crew<br/>
Give it to me, OHHHH, send it to me, OHHHH<br/>
But before I get down, where's my money?<br/>
Let me get down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Craig Mack]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(Hahhh.. boyeee)<br/>
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(I just wanna funk a little bit)<br/>
Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
(Hahh.. I just wanna funk)<br/>
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down<br/>
