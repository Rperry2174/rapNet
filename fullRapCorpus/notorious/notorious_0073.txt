<i>[Diddy]</i><br/>
Its Bad Boy bitch<br/>
Scram Jones... the Clipse... B.I.G.<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Biggie]</i><br/>
Niggaz in my faction don't like asking questions<br/>
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring<br/>
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito<br/>
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's<br/>
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats<br/>
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets<br/>
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease<br/>
Muah!, may you rest in peace<br/>
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours<br/>
Four-four, and fifty-four draw<br/>
As my pilot, steers my Leer<br/>
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear<br/>
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying<br/>
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying<br/>
So don't you get suspicious<br/>
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious<br/>
As I leave my competition, respirator style<br/>
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style<br/>
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all<br/>
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)<br/>
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)<br/>
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Biggie (chorus)]</i><br/>
Do you know where your going too<br/>
Just a memory...everybody dying<br/>
When I throw my clip in the AK<br/>
May you rest in peace<br/>
Your nobody till somebody kills you<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where your goin too<br/>
Just a memory...so you better pack a pistol<br/>
Everybody dying, death controls y'all<br/>
Your nobody till somebody kills you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T]</i><br/>
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows<br/>
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk<br/>
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke<br/>
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke<br/>
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie<br/>
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy<br/>
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses<br/>
That carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing<br/>
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow<br/>
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa<br/>
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing<br/>
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)<br/>
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping<br/>
You thought all the floss had me slipping?<br/>
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing<br/>
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Malice]</i><br/>
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad<br/>
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar<br/>
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car<br/>
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage<br/>
Even as a youth I was laudering the stoop<br/>
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue<br/>
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof<br/>
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof<br/>
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable<br/>
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table<br/>
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle<br/>
Because Im a provider as long as I am able<br/>
This here hughe the most foolish of blues<br/>
When I tell my mom the price<br/>
She damn near sent me to my room<br/>
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S<br/>
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Diddy]</i><br/>
Biggie Duets...<br/>
Born Again...<br/>
Life After Death...<br/>
Legacy lives on..and on, and on<br/>
These motherfuckers still can't see you BIG<br/>
shit you ain't even here..<br/>
Motherfuckers better step their game up..<br/>
Greatest of all time, Greatest of all time!<br/>
Motherfuckers...
