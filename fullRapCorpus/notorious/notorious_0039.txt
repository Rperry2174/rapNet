<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
TIME, TIME FOR YOU To DIE<br/>
AS I KISS--YOur--ASS--GOODNIGHT<br/>
<br/>
I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese<br/>
When I release, you loose teeth like Little Cease<br/>
Nigga please<br/>
Blood floods your dungarees<br/>
And that's just a half of my warpath<br/>
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater<br/>
than the average player hater, and spectators<br/>
Buy my CD twice<br/>
They see me in the streets they be like you he nice<br/>
But that's on the low doe'<br/>
be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show<br/>
I pull out 4-4's, and go up in they clothes<br/>
Short-change niggas<br/>
snort-cane niggas<br/>
extortion came quicker<br/>
Bought the Range' nigga<br/>
You still tickle me<br/>
I used to be as strong as ripple, till Little Cease crippled me<br/>
Now I play hard-like my girls nipples be<br/>
The games sour like like a pickle be<br/>
You all know the rules<br/>
Move from BK to New Jerus<br/>
Thinking 'bout, all the planes we flew<br/>
Bitches, we ran through<br/>
Now the years new<br/>
I lay my game flat<br/>
I want my spot back, take two<br/>
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious<br/>
Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous<br/>
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina<br/>
Slugs missed you<br/>
I ain't mad at you (we ain't mad at you)<br/>
Blood rushing, concussions, ain't nothing<br/>
Catch cases, come out fronting<br/>
Smoking something<br/>
Sipping White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumping<br/>
I laced it wit the basic<br/>
6 TV's, a system, knocking Mase shit, face it<br/>
We hard to hit<br/>
Guard your shit, for I stick you, for your re-up<br/>
Wipe the "P"<br/>
Mix shots, "work your seat up"<br/>
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up<br/>
LONG KISS<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS X 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
UH-I flaming gats, aiming at, these fucking...<br/>
Maniacs put my name in raps--"support them"<br/>
Games dat<br/>
Like they hustle backwards<br/>
I smoke backwards, and Duchees<br/>
Ya can't touch me<br/>
Try to rush me<br/>
Slugs go, touchy-touchy<br/>
You're bleeding lovely, with you, spirit above me<br/>
or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky<br/>
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me<br/>
Rest where the worms-n-the weak be<br/>
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys<br/>
With the holy ghost<br/>
I put holes in most, you hold your toast shakey<br/>
Slip-n-trying to break me<br/>
Look what you made me do, brains blue<br/>
My team in the Marine blew, six-coupe<br/>
Skiid it out, weeded out, clean it out<br/>
The block for distance is, given long kisses bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS X 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Frank White the menacing, craw-craw's demenacin<br/>
I got the lettuce in<br/>
You turn green like cucumber skin got the new hummer in the summer when I was a new comer<br/>
then drugs and mac-10's<br/>
Hug from fake friends<br/>
Make ends they hate you, be broke girls won't date you<br/>
That's why I relate to, choke your ass 'til your face blue, make you<br/>
Open the safe too<br/>
No matter how you call it (how you call it)<br/>
This "bralick", alcoholic<br/>
Like his weed green'd out like his brick solid<br/>
Distribute to kids who, take heart like Valentine, drink Valentine, all the time<br/>
Slugs hit you chest tap the spine<br/>
Flat-line<br/>
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked foe times<br/>
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real doe'<br/>
"Slink steal slow"<br/>
As you remorse we feel no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS X 6]</i>
