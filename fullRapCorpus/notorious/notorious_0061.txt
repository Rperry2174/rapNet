But I would've loved to hear<br/>
A Big Pun and B.I.G. collabo<br/>
That shit would've been incredible<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Pun talking]</i><br/>
Aye yaknahmsayin, it was just happen<br/>
We have our day, you know?<br/>
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?<br/>
We keep it, keep it, keep it going from there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Uhh, I dream filthy<br/>
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey<br/>
Huh, what a set up<br/>
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off<br/>
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off<br/>
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land<br/>
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies<br/>
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up<br/>
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD<br/>
Cryin, know my friends is lyin<br/>
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers<br/>
or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant<br/>
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot<br/>
Giving cats the opposite of diets<br/>
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye<br/>
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me<br/>
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)<br/>
Apoligies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter<br/>
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like<br/>
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest<br/>
Silencers so you can't hear it<br/>
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me<br/>
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Freeway]</i><br/>
Nigga still gotta get his grind on<br/>
Come get introduced to my home<br/>
I grew up in the crime zone<br/>
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap<br/>
You keep your chrome cause the streets is chilly<br/>
Now get your grind on<br/>
Come get introduced to my home<br/>
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin mo' stressed<br/>
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor<br/>
Cause the streets are killin<br/>
Now get your grind on<br/>
Come get introduced to my home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Punisher]</i><br/>
Yo, yo<br/>
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed<br/>
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip<br/>
I never reject an offer to battle<br/>
Slap a coffin on the saddle<br/>
and rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio<br/>
Niggaz talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin nuttin<br/>
If ain't blazin somethin with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins<br/>
Fake the funk and get your rump roast<br/>
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close<br/>
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin<br/>
for the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin<br/>
An orgi-nation of veterans built<br/>
with genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills<br/>
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills<br/>
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills<br/>
We blessed with the will to never surrender<br/>
cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja<br/>
It's my world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fat Joe]</i><br/>
I got that new F-N, call it that faggot nigga gun<br/>
Couple of hollow tips make you faggot niggaz run<br/>
Crack pull up, everybody clear out<br/>
Anybody pumpin that rock is gettin aired out<br/>
I'm in that caddy with my bitch in the pack<br/>
Your mommy got a body but she itchin to clap<br/>
And I know you pitchin purple but we switchin the packs<br/>
Listen, don't make me hurt you I'm just givin the facts<br/>
On that I 9-5 swirvin to a town near you<br/>
My niggaz watch out for that Black Surburbans<br/>
And no it's not the Feds, man papi's home<br/>
And papi got it good, he could put you on<br/>
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot<br/>
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops<br/>
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops<br/>
Just to see my niggaz eat and shit and huggin the blocks<br/>
Crack a chestize 'em, right besides 'em<br/>
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em<br/>
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up<br/>
And niggaz get shot in broad day cause we don't give a...<br/>
Fuck little niggaz on bike and just shoot you<br/>
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shits brutal<br/>
I done seen fiends O.D., shot the wrong pack<br/>
Then they call the shit the bomb smack<br/>
Word to Crack, the god body, the hard body, the realest ever<br/>
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? Never<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again<br/>
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin<br/>
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and<br/>
be Mor-gan than Freeman<br/>
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces<br/>
Fuck the screwfaces, cause when I flip<br/>
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas<br/>
Niggaz can't bang with us, try to do me<br/>
My crew be unruly (what)<br/>
To old school cats that call gats toolies<br/>
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies<br/>
And fuck without rubbers (what) specialize<br/>
in killin wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin, shit<br/>
When Frank start bustin, Frank start somethin<br/>
Killin ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley<br/>
Me and Sean Combs takin broads home<br/>
On the phone with the chip,  with these Cristal chicks<br/>
Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit
