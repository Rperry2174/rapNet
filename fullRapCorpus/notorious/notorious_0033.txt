<i>[Chuck D]</i> "One two three four five six seven eight nine"<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, it's the ten crack commandments<br/>
What, uhh, uhh<br/>
Nigga can't tell me nothin bout this coke, uh-huh<br/>
Can't tell me nothin bout this crack, this weed<br/>
To my hustlin niggaz<br/>
Niggaz on the corner I ain't forget you niggaz<br/>
My triple beam niggaz, word up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chuck D]</i> "One two three four five six seven eight nine"<br/>
"TEN"<br/>
<br/>
I been in this game for years, it made me a animal<br/>
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual<br/>
A step by step booklet for you to get<br/>
your game on track, not your wig pushed back<br/>
Rule nombre uno: never let no one know<br/>
how much, dough you hold, cause you know<br/>
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially<br/>
if that man fucked up, get your ass stuck up<br/>
Number two: never let em know your next move<br/>
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence<br/>
Take it from your highness (uh-huh)<br/>
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips<br/>
Number three: never trust no-bo-dy<br/>
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up<br/>
Hoodie to mask up, shit, for that fast buck<br/>
she be layin in the bushes to light that ass up<br/>
Number four: know you heard this before<br/>
Never get high, on your own supply<br/>
Number five: never sell no crack where you rest at<br/>
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell em bounce<br/>
Number six: that god damn credit, dead it<br/>
You think a crackhead payin you back, shit forget it<br/>
Seven: this rule is so underrated<br/>
Keep your family and business completely seperated<br/>
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch<br/>
Find yourself in serious shit<br/>
Number eight: never keep no weight on you<br/>
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too<br/>
Number nine shoulda been number one to me<br/>
If you ain't gettin bags stay the fuck from police (uh-huh)<br/>
If niggaz think you snitchin ain't tryin listen<br/>
They be sittin in your kitchen, waitin to start hittin<br/>
Number ten: a strong word called consignment<br/>
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen<br/>
If you ain't got the clientele say hell no<br/>
Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow<br/>
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up<br/>
If not, twenty-four years, on the wake up<br/>
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up<br/>
Caretaker did your makeup, when you pass<br/>
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks<br/>
she sniffed a whole half of cake up<br/>
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up<br/>
Gotta go gotta go, more pasta bake up, word up, uhh<br/>
<br/>
Crack king, Frank Blizzard<br/>
Uhh<br/>
<br/>
