<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Venue after venue, I've been through<br/>
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you<br/>
Send you to the store, condoms and more<br/>
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores<br/>
Could it be my hardcore metaphor<br/>
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor<br/>
Open up the Lex door<br/>
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired<br/>
I'm a roll blunts while you spin<br/>
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving<br/>
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin<br/>
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se<br/>
Much foreplay, that's my forte<br/>
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death<br/>
She looking for a man, honey he just left<br/>
Violate me, he get beat to death<br/>
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left<br/>
Grand Marnier increase the don strength<br/>
Two four-fifths within my arms length<br/>
With a calm breath I say we gots to float<br/>
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat<br/>
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine<br/>
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen<br/>
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue<br/>
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu<br/>
Beautiful, that's how the night goes<br/>
Get out them tight clothes<br/>
Get in some night clothes<br/>
I invite those girls that smoke lye<br/>
Keep it real with you<br/>
You keep it real with I<br/>
We be tight like frog's ass<br/>
Have you screaming "Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Puff Daddy]</i><br/>
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)<br/>
Would you lie for me? (That's right)<br/>
Would you get high with me? (For sure)<br/>
Would you die for me? (No doubt)<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Kim]</i><br/>
These hoes don't treat you like I treat you<br/>
Like my contacts, I can see right through<br/>
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?<br/>
Queen Bitch means number one and two<br/>
Wifey, ya'll ain't got to like me<br/>
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one<br/>
Y'all know where I'm from<br/>
Bucktown, lay your ass down<br/>
You don't wanna play around (with me)<br/>
Probably just mad because Frank chose me<br/>
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie<br/>
Girls call my telephone just to hang up<br/>
While me and you is in the crib, laying up<br/>
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together<br/>
And that we gonna have a kid together<br/>
Whatever, me intimidated, never<br/>
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim<br/>
Anyway, I fuck better than you<br/>
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you<br/>
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing<br/>
B.I.G.  is in my heart from the start<br/>
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch<br/>
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?<br/>
(See I don't care bout them other broads)<br/>
B.I.G. kept it real with me, and that's that<br/>
<br/>
