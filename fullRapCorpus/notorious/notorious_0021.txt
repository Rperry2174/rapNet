<i>[Big]</i> Uhh<br/>
<i>[Dad]</i> I like that, you like that? Heh<br/>
<i>[Big]</i> Here's another one<br/>
<i>[Dad]</i> And another one<br/>
<i>[Big]</i> And another one<br/>
<i>[Dad]</i> And another one<br/>
<i>[Big]</i> Uhh, what, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro/Chorus: R. Kelly, Biggie (variations on Big's part)]</i><br/>
<br/>
You must be used to me spendin<br/>
And all that sweet winin and dinin<br/>
Well I'm fuckin you tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big]</i> Here's another one<br/>
And another one<br/>
Uhh, uhh, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
<br/>
Some say the x, make the sex<br/>
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from yo neck<br/>
To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tgue deliverin<br/>
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine<br/>
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight<br/>
If its alright with you, we fuckin (that's cool)<br/>
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park<br/>
Pissy off Bacardi Dark<br/>
Remember when I used to play between yo legs<br/>
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head<br/>
Straight to yo mother's bed<br/>
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot<br/>
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the<br/>
way she used to rub my back, when I hit that<br/>
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle<br/>
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian<br/>
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
<br/>
Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine<br/>
I like that waistline<br/>
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb<br/>
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time<br/>
I got you pinned up, with yo fuckin limbs up<br/>
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up<br/>
Bitch keep yo shin up, please watch me do thee<br/>
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy<br/>
I like it when you tro' it pon me<br/>
No love makin, strictly back breakin<br/>
Ceas' know, all his hoes, go to my door<br/>
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more<br/>
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh<br/>
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti<br/>
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's<br/>
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lets stop the bullshit baby<br/>
Let me take you to the stop, get you hot<br/>
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy<br/>
B.I.G., bring that ass to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat to fade with variations]</i>
