<i>[Jamaican host]</i><br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen<br/>
We're gonna ask you for some fanfare...the band fanfare because...ladies and gentlemen...sting has always gone ahead of itself.<br/>
They have done it again and again and again.<br/>
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten thousand fire sides.<br/>
And if you know...and if you enjoy hip-hop...if you want one of the coldest brothaz out of North America...a brotha that gave you a song like<br/>
Juicy...<br/>
<i>[Bigge]</i> Uh-huh...<br/>
<i>[Jamaican Host]</i><br/>
You hear a crew in Jamaica with something that goes like this<br/>
"Who the heck is this<br/>
Paging me in the morning<br/>
At the crack of dawning"<br/>
<i>[Bigge]</i> Yeauh! <br/>
<i>[Jamaican Host]</i><br/>
Please welcome...for the first time...in Sting 96...Please welcome (welcome...welcome)<br/>
The Notorious....the Notorious...B.I.G...AKA bigge!
