Yo<br/>

Caesar Leo Degenero<br/>
Bled C<br/>
Money SL<br/>
Uhh...<br/>
<br/>
B.I.G. is making this cream<br/>
Bitches always say what the hell does that mean?<br/>
B is for the bitches, who can't understand<br/>
How one fly nigga became a man<br/>
I is for the way it goes in and out<br/>
One by one I knocks em out<br/>
G is for the way the game goes in the gutter<br/>
Other MC's man they ain't sayin nuthin<br/>
Rockin on, to the break of dawn<br/>
Make the bitch give the pussy get the mouth I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
It ain't no more to it
