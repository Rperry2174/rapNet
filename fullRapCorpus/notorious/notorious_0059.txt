<i>[B.I.G.:]</i><br/>
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat,<br/>
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,<br/>
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,<br/>
squeeze your clip hit the right one,<br/>
pass that weed I got to light one,<br/>
Squeeze your clip<br/>
hit the right one,<br/>
pass that weed I got to light one,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse (B.I.G.):]</i><br/>
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us,<br/>
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us notorious, thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us,<br/>
You all niggas be scrambling gambling, up in restaurants with mandolins and violins,<br/>
We're just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin,<br/>
High off weed and lots of gin, so much smoke need oxygen,<br/>
Steadily countin' them benjamins, nigga you should to if you knew what this game would do to you,<br/>
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I've been through,<br/>
So called beef with you know who, fucked a few female stars or two,<br/>
Then a bluelight niggas knew like<br/>
Mike-shit not to be fuck with. Motherfucker better duck quick.<br/>
'cause me and my dogs love to buck shit, fuck the luck shit strictly aim<br/>
No asperation to quit the game.<br/>
<br/>
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,<br/>
Squeeze your clip and hit the right one<br/>
Pass that weed l gotta light one<br/>
<br/>
All them niggas l gotta fight one<br/>
All them hoes l gotta like one<br/>
Our situation is a tight one<br/>
What you wanna do? Fight or run?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
Making money livin' marvelous, in god we trust,<br/>
Don't too many niggas wanna start with us, got big guns in the cars with us,<br/>
Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us,<br/>
Don't really wanna show you what a G.I.B., I'd rather be sippin' Remy in V.I.P.,<br/>
When you hear the music it'll be by me, Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G.,<br/>
Brooklyn and K-town, when you checking out the flow, you know it's going rain with persistence,<br/>
2 legends on the same track, 2 different plains of existence,<br/>
Let's get it crackin' I love to bust flows, hit it from the back 'cause I love to buck hoe,<br/>
Spit it for the city I love Chicago, cali-coes buck, I love to bust those,<br/>
You think you can spit on the Mike like Biggie and flow just as steady as I,<br/>
shit is real you know you love him,<br/>
you ain't got "Ready to Die", "Life After Death",<br/>
give to 'em, however you wanna nigga, that a day after, give it to you, however you wanna nigga,<br/>
'cause the shit is giddie, so I carry big heat, screamin' come and get me,<br/>
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz beat,<br/>
3 mils I love to make 1, all these cars I love to ride 1,<br/>
All these hoes I love to cut 1,<br/>
a tribute to BIG,<br/>
I love to bust 1,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bone Thugs N Harmony]</i><br/>
In the middle of it hammer, bring niggas more drama than they baby mama, nigga wanna battle I will bomb you,<br/>
One man but attack like a pack of piranhas, like terracotta,<br/>
Niggas always ready for war, they don't really wanna see a nigga though,<br/>
We can hit 'em in a minute, then be finished with 'em<br/>
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga with a sick-o floor<br/>
Here with Swizz, oh, no! Nigga's in trouble,<br/>
Somebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to serving them burners (yeah),<br/>
And niggas you all heard of me, brick city killer, nigga word to me,<br/>
And I'm passed that like Bernie Magic, with a jack that'll snatch that rep, and stack some, drag him,<br/>
Double on that back random, with the bullets stop brand him,<br/>
Feeling hard you can't harass him,<br/>
Put it up in your magic, catch the magnum flashing cannons, niggas ain't ready for this 1, '<br/>
cause I'm on a mission to get even better than believe it I'm heavily heated,<br/>
It's easy to see it, if you wanna see me let that be the reason.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
