Who the fuck is this?<br/>
pagin me at 5:46 in the mornin crack a dawnin<br/>
now I'm yawnin, wipe the cold out my eye<br/>
see who's this pagin me and why..<br/>
It's my nigga Pop from the barbershop<br/>
told me he was in the gamblin spot and heard the intricate plot<br/>
some niggas wanna stick you like fly paper neighbour<br/>
slow down love please chill drop the caper<br/>
remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville<br/>
that you rolled dice wit<br/>
smoked the blunts and got nice wit<br/>
yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect<br/>
nah dem my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect<br/>
I didn't say dem,<br/>
they schooled me to some niggas<br/>
that you knew from back when,<br/>
when you was clockin minor figures<br/>
Now they heard you blowin up like nitro<br/>
know they wanna stick the knife<br/>
through your windpipe slow..<br/>
so thank Fame for warnin me now I'm warnin you<br/>
you got the mac nigga<br/>
tell me what you wanna do...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Damn niggas wanna stick me for my papers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus<br/>
wit the Texas license plate outta state<br/>
they heard about the pounds<br/>
you got down in Georgetown<br/>
now they heard you got half of Virginia locked down<br/>
they even heard about the crib<br/>
you bought your moms out in Florida<br/>
the fifth corridor....<br/>
Call the coroner<br/>
there's gonna be alot of slow singin<br/>
and flower bringin<br/>
if my burgular alarm starts ringin<br/>
whatcha think all the guns is for?<br/>
all purpose war got the rottweilers by the door<br/>
and I feed em gun powder so they can devour<br/>
the criminals tryna to drop my decimals<br/>
DAMN..niggas wanna stick me for my cream<br/>
And it ain't a dream things aint always what it seems<br/>
it's the ones that smoke blunts witcha<br/>
see your picture, now they wanna<br/>
grab they guns and come and getcha<br/>
Bethca Biggie won't slip<br/>
I got the calico with the black talons loaded in the clip<br/>
so I can rip through the ligaments<br/>
put the fuckas in a bad prediciment<br/>
where all the foul niggas went<br/>
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta<br/>
Buck with what I had you with<br/>
you motherfuckers betta duck<br/>
I bring pain, blood stains on what remains<br/>
Of his jacket, he had a gun he should've packed it<br/>
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket<br/>
so I can reload and explode down ya rasshole<br/>
I fuck around and get hardcore<br/>
C4 to ya door no beef no more nigga<br/>
feel the rush scandalous<br/>
The more weed smoke I puff the more dangerous<br/>
I dont give a fuck about you or your weak crew<br/>
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you<br/>
I'm not runnin, nigga I bust my gun in<br/>
Hold on I hear somebody comin........<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dogs Barking]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Shh..."<br/>
"Come on mothafucka!"<br/>
"I'm comin' as fast as I can"<br/>
"Just bring yo mothafuckin' ass on come on!"<br/>
"Are we gettin' close? Huh?"<br/>
"It's right over here"<br/>
"Man, are you sure it's biggie smalls crib man?"<br/>
"Yeah i'm sure mothafucka come on"<br/>
"Oh fuck,it better be his mothafuckin' house"<br/>
"Fuck?"<br/>
"It better be this mothafucka's house"<br/>
"Oh shit!"<br/>
"What? What's wrong man?<br/>
"What's that red dot on your head man?"<br/>
"What red dot?"<br/>
...<br/>
"Oh shit, you got a red dot on your head too!"<br/>
"OH SHIT!"<br/>
<br/>
