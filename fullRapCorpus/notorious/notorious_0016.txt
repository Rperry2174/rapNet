(Hello? Aw shit, nigga.  What the fuck time is it, man?<br/>
Oh god damn. Nigga do you know what time it is?<br/>
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You alright?<br/>
Aw, nigga what the fuck is wrong wit you?)<br/>
<br/>
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell<br/>
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell<br/>
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies<br/>
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies<br/>
God will probably have me on some real strict shit<br/>
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked<br/>
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise<br/>
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice<br/>
All my life I been considered as the worst<br/>
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse<br/>
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion<br/>
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion<br/>
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger<br/>
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger<br/>
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?<br/>
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies<br/>
My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2<br/>
Who's to blame for both of them (naw nigga, not you)<br/>
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit<br/>
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit<br/>
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red<br/>
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head<br/>
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,<br/>
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind<br/>
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me<br/>
Naw you wouldn't understand (nigga, talk to me please)<br/>
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack<br/>
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back<br/>
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet<br/>
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me<br/>
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone<br/>
She knew me and her sista had somethin' goin' on<br/>
I reach my peak, I can't speak,<br/>
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak.<br/>
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin',<br/>
matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'.<br/>
