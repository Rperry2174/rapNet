<i>[Biggie (chorus)]</i><br/>
What's beef?  Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep<br/>
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets<br/>
Beef is when I see you, guaranteed to be an ICU, one more time<br/>
What's beef?  Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep<br/>
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep<br/>
Beef is when I see you guaranteed to be a ICU, check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Havoc]</i><br/>

A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Cristopher (yea, chris)<br/>
Watch me set it off like Vivica (c'mon thats right)<br/>
Here lies your demise, close your eyes (close your eyes)<br/>
