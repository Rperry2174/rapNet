<i>[Chorus: repeat 4X]</i><br/>
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie <i>[repeat 8X]</i><br/>
Let's Ride <i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
Get High <i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Biggie, BizzyBone, KrayzieBone]</i><br/>
Armed and dangerous<br/>
ain't too many can bang with us<br/>
straight up weed no angel dust, label us notorious.<br/>
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us<br/>
you all niggas be scrambling, gambling<br/>
up in restaurants with mandolins and violins.<br/>
We just sittin' here trying to win, try not to sin<br/>
high off weed and lot's of gin<br/>
so much smoke need oxygen<br/>
steadily countin' them Benjamins.<br/>
Nigga you should too, if you knew, what this game'll do to you<br/>
been in this shit since '92<br/>
look at all the bullshit I been through<br/>
so called beef with you know who<br/>
fuck a few female stars or two<br/>
then a blue light niggas knew like<br/>
Mike-shit not to be fuck wit.<br/>
Motherfucker better duck quick<br/>
'cause me and my dogs love to buck shit,<br/>
fuck the luck shit strictly aim<br/>
no aspiration to quit the game.<br/>
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,<br/>
squeeze your clip and hit the right one<br/>
pass that weed I gotta light one<br/>
all them niggas I gotta fight one<br/>
all them hoes I gotta like one<br/>
our situation is a tight one<br/>
what you wanna do? fight or run?<br/>
Seems to me that you'll take thee,<br/>
Bone and Big nigga die slowly<br/>
I'm gonna tell you like a nigga told me,<br/>
cash rule everything around me.<br/>
Shit lyrically, niggas can't see me, fuck it,<br/>
buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it,<br/>
blow the bitch before you caught yourself loving it -- nigga wit a Benz fucking it.<br/>
Doesn't it seem odd to you<br/>
Big comes through wit mobs and crews<br/>
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thug dudes<br/>
who's the killer? me or you?<br/>
(We forgive you for you know not what you do)<br/>
<br/>
Seven A.M. woke in the mornin' with henney and caffeine and green and nicotine<br/>

beam now between the scenes destroy your dreams, you willing to die we'll see<br/>
how many faces when I cause the scene. We mean mug, Mo' Thugs trying to be<br/>
perfect--disciples, when its survival told by the double edged sword triple,<br/>
six rivals spittin' fire this the real truth bitch, breaking down for lies my<br/>
messiah better be ready for Armageddon shit's expired. it's wild, bless the child,<br/>
the one that became a man<br/>
put in positions already there<br/>
all that I had to do was stare.<br/>
Test me now, contend never no surrender no pretend<br/>
pick up my pen and my hand<br/>
one of my trusted friend, friend. Hey! open and lets see if ya' real,<br/>
we all suited, beg my pardon to Martin, maybe we ain't marchin' we<br/>
shootin', and daily recruitin' there's a thug born, everyday in the ghetto,<br/>
we start em' off little with hit em' up out with a pen and pad hit me led now kick it......<br/>
<br/>
Nigga roll wit Bone up into the days of ours, to the dome wit a shot or burn,<br/>
never do toss on the curb/me feelin' the urge to sperve, when I'm broke as<br/>
fucks and giving that mossburg swerve. Up into my bag, cause I gotta get my mask<br/>
and shells--to put in this 12 gauge sawed off, get em' all off, nigga your<br/>
loss, take it all off, got a nigga caught doe. For the Bone and leatherface<br/>
seemin' to thug in the cut--to let the mo' how many pulling ain't nothin'--bitch<br/>
if ya stick em' we buckin' em guns that's fucked up. Now lemme get down wit the<br/>
crime, gotta go purchase a dime<br/>
put in a state to get down for the crime<br/>
smocking the reefa to ease my mind, swig some wine. Step on the block when<br/>

Thuggin wit me killers,<br/>
