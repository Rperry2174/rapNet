<i>[Verse One: Notorious, Meth]</i><br/>
<br/>
I used to get feels on a bitch<br/>
Now I throw shields on the dick<br/>
To stop me from that HIV shit<br/>
And niggaz know they soft like a Twinkie filling<br/>
Playin the villian<br/>
Prepare for this rap killin<br/>
Biggie Smalls is the illest<br/>
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered<br/>
"What you talkin bout Willis?"<br/>
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White<br/>
is here to excite and<br/>
throw dick to dykes<br/>
Bitches I like em brainless<br/>
Guns I like em stainless steel<br/>
I want the fuckin Fortune like the Wheel<br/>
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty<br/>
Don't tempt me (T-H-O-D Man)<br/>
You don't want to fuck with Biggie<br/>
<br/>
Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit<br/>
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit<br/>
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja<br/>
Comin where you rest at, surrender<br/>
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender<br/>
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December<br/>
Nigga stop bitchin, button up ya lip and<br/>
From Method all you gettin is a can of ass-whippin<br/>
Hey, I'll be kickin, you son, you doin all the yappin<br/>
Actin as if it can't happen<br/>
You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin<br/>
Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin<br/>
So what cha want nigga, ya punk nigga<br/>
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger<br/>
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw<br/>
Kickin down your god damn door (and it goes a lil somethin like this)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit<br/>
And everything you get ya gotta work hard fot it<br/>
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop<br/>
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Meth, Notorious]</i><br/>
<br/>
Verse two, comin with that Olde E brew<br/>
Meth-tical, puttin niggaz back in I.C.U.<br/>
I'm lifted troop, you can bring yours wack ass crew<br/>
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh<br/>
No question, I be comin down and shit<br/>
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get<br/>
And niggaz love it, not in the physical form but in the mental<br/>
I spark and they cells get warm<br/>
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!<br/>
Baby accept it, utmost respect it<br/>
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen<br/>
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my center<br/>
Honies feel it deep in they placenta<br/>
Cold as the pole in the winter<br/>
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed<br/>
And when my Mac unloads<br/>
I'm guaranteed another video<br/>
Ready to die, why I act that way?<br/>
Pop Duke left Mom Duke<br/>
The faggot took the back way<br/>
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up<br/>
I used to do stick-up<br/>
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS<br/>
Excuse me, flows just grow through me<br/>
Like trees to branches<br/>
Cliffs to avalanches<br/>
It's the praying mantis<br/>
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan<br/>
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus<br/>
<br/>
(I got more glocks and techs than you)<br/>
I make it hot (Nigga won't even stand next to you)<br/>
Nigga touch me you better bust me<br/>
tree times in the head<br/>
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i>
