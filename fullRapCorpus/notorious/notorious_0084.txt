What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep<br/>
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep<br/>
Beef is when I see you<br/>
Guaranteed to be an ICU, check it<br/>

All I got is heat and tough talk for you (uh-huh)<br/>
Tie you up, cut your balls off just to use (ooh)<br/>
Man listen straight torture, look what that slick shit bought you<br/>
A first class ticket to Lucife, real name Cristopher<br/>
Watch me set it off like Vivica<br/>
Here lies your demise, close your eyes (uh-huh)<br/>
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten<br/>
Pale blue hands get cold, your soul's risen<br/>
It's bad cause I just begun, we'll make the real bad<br/>
now we're having fun (aha ha!)<br/>
