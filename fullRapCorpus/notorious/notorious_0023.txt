<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We push the hottest V's, peel fast<br/>
through the city, play Monopoly with real cash<br/>
Me and Biggie and the models be, sugar nase and did he ask?<br/>
And parotta be, somethin you cats got to see<br/>
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones<br/>
Being broke is childish and I'm quite grown<br/>
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan<br/>
Scope the spot out, see somethin nice and I'm gone<br/>
You cats is home, screaming the fight's on<br/>
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watching Ty-son<br/>
Same night, same fight<br/>
But one of us cats ain't playing right, I let you tell it<br/>
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons<br/>
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get<br/>
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment<br/>
Makes sense don't it?  Now make dollars<br/>
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis<br/>
And rack up frequent flier mileage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Angela Winbush]</i><br/>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>
I love the dough, more than you know<br/>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
I'm poppin Magnums while Jigga bag somethin<br/>
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from<br/>
flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes<br/>
Make the best CD's and the best tapes<br/>
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals<br/>
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit<br/>
You seen the Jesus, dipped to H classes,<br/>
Ice project off lights, chick flashes<br/>
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in beards and moustaches<br/>
Rock top fashions<br/>
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot<br/>
on the Range, way niggas look at me now, kinda strange<br/>
I hate y'all too<br/>
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachel<br/>
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal<br/>
Bitches used to go, "Ewww!"<br/>
Still tote steel, trying to see five mil<br/>
off the sin-gle, for real<br/>
You ain't fazing the amazing<br/>
While your gun's raisin, mine is blazing<br/>
See you on see me all talking to sweetness<br/>
Take it for weakness and leave quick<br/>
Blocker, rocker, fellow, Bad Boy collabo<br/>
Two MC's with mad dough, jewelry on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Angela Winbush]</i><br/>
I love the dough, more than you know<br/>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Jay-Z, Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Miracu-lous, pockets stay full<br/>
Niggas skip the bull cause we matadors<br/>
Snatch the P-89's that we pack in the drawers<br/>
And we, clappin doors in your Acuras<br/>
Snap like, cameras or amateurs<br/>
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours<br/>
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks in flaws<br/>
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours<br/>
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors<br/>
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss<br/>
Play the charts like the Beatles, y'all dap to loss<br/>
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all<br/>
Too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours<br/>
truly, do we, we laugh at y'all<br/>
Little bastards y'all<br/>
Uhh, uhh<br/>
We hit makers with acres<br/>
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us<br/>
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq<br/>
Country house, tennis courts on horseback<br/>
Riding deciding cracked crab or lobster<br/>
Who say mobsters don't prosper<br/>
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars<br/>
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain<br/>
Reminisce on dames who, coochie used to stink<br/>
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links<br/>
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places<br/>
Tito smile everytime he see our faces<br/>
Cases catch more than outfield-ers<br/>
Half these rappin cats, ain't seen war<br/>
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame<br/>
Speak my name, I make em dash like Dame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Angela Winbush]</i><br/>
I love the dough, more than you know<br/>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>
<i>[repeat to fade]</i>
