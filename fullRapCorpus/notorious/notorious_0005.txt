Yeah...<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
(You ready motherfucker?)<br/>
(We gon' kill your ass)<br/>
<br/>
As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece<br/>
One in the chamber, the safety is off release<br/>
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage<br/>
Biggie Smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage<br/>
Teflon is the material for the imperial<br/>
mic ripper girl stripper the Henny sipper<br/>
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch<br/>
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive<br/>
the Q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit<br/>
Respect is collected, so check it<br/>
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks<br/>
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh<br/>
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave G<br/>
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me<br/>
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl<br/>
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die<br/>
<br/>
As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook<br/>
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks<br/>
A big BAD motherfucker on the wrong road<br/>
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold<br/>
I want it all from the Rolexes<br/>
to the Lexus gettin paid, is all I expected<br/>
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?<br/>
Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck<br/>
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel<br/>
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal<br/>
Kickin niggaz down the steps just for rep<br/>
Any repercussion lead to niggaz gettin wet<br/>
The infrared's at your head real steady<br/>
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready<br/>
<br/>
I'm ready to die!<br/>
(Nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet)<br/>
(We gonna make you suffer)<br/>
<br/>
In a sec I throw the tec to your fuckin neck<br/>
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some wreck<br/>
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talkin<br/>
You better act like CeCe, and keep on walkin<br/>
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat<br/>
You swung on like you slumber right you fell to the conrete<br/>
Your face, my feet, they meet, we're stompin<br/>
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton<br/>
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane<br/>
Niggaz say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain<br/>
Make your shit splatter<br/>
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter<br/>
after the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split<br/>
down your backbone to where your motherfuckin cheek drip<br/>
The shit I kick, rip it through the vest<br/>
Biggie Smalls passin any test, I'm ready to die!<br/>
<br/>
I'm ready<br/>
(Time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)<br/>
Niggaz definitely know what time it is<br/>
The Notorious one in full effect<br/>
for ninety-three!<br/>
Suicidal, I'm ready!<br/>
<br/>
(Now I lay me down to sleep)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)<br/>
(If I should die before I wake)<br/>
(I pray the Lord my soul to take)<br/>
(Cause I'm ready to die)<br/>
<br/>
(All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to)<br/>
<br/>
(Biggie Smalls the biggest man)<br/>
(Rockin on and on in ninety-three, Easy Mo Bee)<br/>
(Third Eye, and the rest of the Bad Boy fam)<br/>
(I don't wanna see no cryin at my funeral)
