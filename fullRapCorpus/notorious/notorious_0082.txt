<i>[The Notorious B.I.G.:]</i><br/>
First things first, I poppa! - Freaks all the honies! (uh-huh!)<br/>
Dummies! (uh!) - Playboy bunnies, those wantin' money.<br/>
Those the ones I like cause they don't get Nathan<br/>
But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation.<br/>
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs,<br/>
Heart throb? Never! - Black and ugly as ever!<br/>
However - I stay Coogi down to the socks<br/>
Rings and watch filled with rocks! (uh!)<br/>
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi<br/>
Girls pee pee when they see me (uh-huh!) navajos creep me in they tee pee! (uh!)<br/>
As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet<br/>
Stop it! (uh!) - If you think they gonna make a prophet!<br/>
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns! - Get it?<br/>
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it (uh!) then split it!<br/>
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A. (uh!)<br/>
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya!<br/>
I'm clockin ya, Versace shades watchin' ya! (uh-huh!)<br/>
Once ya grin, I'm in, game begin! (uh!)<br/>
First I talk about how I dresses this,<br/>
In diamond necklasses, stretch Lexuses! (whooo!)<br/>
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get<br/>
Deeper and deeper! - Help ya reach the (uh-huh!)<br/>
Climax that your man can't make<br/>
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late, and sing the break! (uh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1: Faith Evans (The Notorious B.I.G.) &amp; ("Puff Daddy")]</i><br/>
Baabyyyyyy, heeeeere I am (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[The Notorious B.I.G. ("Puff Daddy"):]</i><br/>
She's sick of that song on how it's so long<br/>
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz,<br/>
There I is! (uh!) - Major Payne like Damon Wayans (uh-huh!)<br/>
Low Down Dirty even like his brother Keenan.<br/>
Schemin'! (uh!) - Don't leave ya girl round me<br/>
True player for real, ask Puff Dad-dy! ("yeeeah! ")<br/>
You ringin' bells with bags from Chanel<br/>
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel. (uh!)<br/>
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell (uh-huh!)<br/>
She beeped me, meet me at twelve! (uh!)<br/>
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, payin car notes? ("yeeeah! ")<br/>
While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke! ("uh-huh! ")<br/>
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke<br/>
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat! (uh-huh!)<br/>
Nuttin left to do but send her home to you,<br/>
I'm through! - Can ya sing the song for me, boo?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: Faith Evans (The Notorious B.I.G.)]</i><br/>
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance!<br/>
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)<br/>
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance!<br/>
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Notorious B.I.G. ("Puff Daddy"):]</i><br/>
So, what's it gonna be? - Him or me? (uh!)<br/>
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls. (uh-huh!)<br/>
The envy of all women - crushed linen!<br/>
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em. (whoooo!)<br/>
The finest women I love with a passion<br/>
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'!<br/>
High fashion - flyin' into all states (uh!)<br/>
Sexin me while ya man <i>[masturbates]</i>! ("uhh, uhh! ")<br/>
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight<br/>
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds. (uh!)<br/>
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent (what?)<br/>
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president! (uh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: x1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Diddy (The Notorious B.I.G.)]</i><br/>
Bad Boy, Bad Boy!<br/>
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)<br/>
EastCoast, EastCoast...<br/>
WestCoast, WestCoast...
