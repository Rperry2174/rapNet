Yeah, uh, is going out to all the pimps and macs<br/>
Y'all know the flavour, Brooklyn style<br/>
You know how we do, uh, yeah<br/>
All the macs and the dons in the house<br/>
Playa playaz, playa, playa - get the hoes know<br/>
One two:<br/>
<br/>
Is it true, all I wanna do is screw<br/>
Drink brew, with the crew, on the avenue, uh<br/>
I flip skins like Mary Lou<br/>
So. what ya gonna do when (aicha) come for you, boo<br/>
I got girls that look like Toni Braxton<br/>
And give me the skin without askin'<br/>
When I'm relaxin' on my back and you know what time it is, uh<br/>
What of it's Redman, now leave it alone<br/>
She can call me on my cellular phone<br/>
And I mess around and pick you up<br/>
Take you to the crib, stick you up<br/>
Put on my Silk CD and lick you up and down<br/>
Til you say stop it the twat, til your pops call the cops<br/>
And when I make bail outta jail, I'mmma wail on that tail<br/>
Because the sex never fails<br/>
<br/>
I am, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing - and I been waiting<br/>
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm<br/>
This is for the macs and dons<br/>
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm<br/>
<br/>
What kind a girls do you like<br/>
Well, that's various<br/>
I like long hair or them Halle-Berry-cuts<br/>
Real big butts, yeah, thick with lip stick<br/>
Cause when it come to girls I'm optimistic<br/>
Like the Sounds of Blackness<br/>
I don't need practice in the sack it's natural<br/>
I break your back in<br/>
I pop coochies like my homeboy Luke<br/>
Guaranteed to knock your trees off your Timbo boots<br/>
You don't get pussy whipped, you whip that pussy<br/>
Hit it from the back til it get real cushy, baby<br/>
Good sex is what I'm startin'<br/>
I get the skin so wet, I make the ass start fartin'<br/>
And I pray that dick don't slip<br/>
Cause then I'm hearin' this shit: "That's not it"<br/>
And then I just ride til the sun rise<br/>
And when I'm done I whipe the cum on her thighs<br/>
<br/>
I am, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing - and I been waiting<br/>
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm<br/>
This is for the macs and dons<br/>
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm<br/>
This is for the macs and dons<br/>
<br/>
This is going out to the pimps and macs<br/>
That hit skins til their broud catch a asthma attack<br/>
But not even Pamatti Miss could resist<br/>
The way I jumped up in this clitoris<br/>
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom in the boom poom<br/>
Smoke a little boom, get some head in the bedroom<br/>
And then I whisper soft in the ear<br/>
You ain't got to home but you got to leave from here<br/>
Simple and plain no strings attached<br/>
I'm lettin' you know that I'm a certified mac<br/>
I hit skins til the leg cramp<br/>
So, on the first I can get half the check and half the stash<br/>
<br/>
I am, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing - and I been waiting<br/>
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm<br/>
This is for the macs and dons<br/>
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm<br/>
This is for the macs and dons<br/>
<br/>
All the playaz in '94, recognize:<br/>
Something D full effect, baby, baby<br/>
Uh, uh yeah, fuck all you bitches
