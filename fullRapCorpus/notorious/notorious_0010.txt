I don't wanna live no mo'<br/>
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'<br/>
I'm living everyday like a hustle<br/>
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle<br/>
<br/>
I know how it feels to wake up fucked up<br/>
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell<br/>
People look at you like you're the user<br/>
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser<br/>
But they don't know about the stress-filled day<br/>
Baby on the way mad bills to pay<br/>
That's why you drink Tanqueray<br/>
So you can reminisce and wish<br/>
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit<br/>
I remember I was just like you<br/>
Smoking blunts with my crew<br/>
Flipping oldies 62's<br/>
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D<br/>
That's why my mom hates me<br/>
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt<br/>
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south<br/>
Packed up my tools for my raw power move<br/>
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves<br/>
Four drunks trying to stop my flow<br/>
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy<br/>
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick<br/>
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it<br/>
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault<br/>
That I caught in Bridge Port, New York<br/>
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man<br/>
You better have your gat in hand<br/>
'Cause man<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna live no mo'<br/>
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'<br/>
I'm living everyday like a hustle<br/>
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle<br/>
<br/>
I had the master plan<br/>
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland<br/>
With my man Tutex to take over this projects<br/>
They call him Tutex, he tote two techs<br/>
And when he starts to bust<br/>
He likes to ask who's next?<br/>
I got my honies on the Amtrack<br/>
With the crack in the crack of her ass<br/>
Two pounds of hash in the stash<br/>
I wait for hun to make some quick cash<br/>
I told her she could be lieutenant bitch got gassed<br/>
At last I'm literally lounging Black,<br/>
Seating back counting double digit thousands stacks<br/>
Had to re-up see what's up with my peeps<br/>
Toyota dealer cars had it cheap on the jeeps<br/>
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread<br/>
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head<br/>
Then I got the phone call<br/>
It couldn't hit me harder<br/>
We got infiltrated<br/>
Like Nino at the Carter<br/>
I heard Tec got murdered in a town I've never heard of<br/>
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners<br/>
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch<br/>
I told her where she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich<br/>
Conspiracy should be home in three<br/>
Until them I look south for the home family<br/>
A true G, that's me blowing like a bubble<br/>
In the everyday struggle<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna live no mo'<br/>
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'<br/>
I'm living everyday like a hustle<br/>
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle<br/>
<br/>
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani<br/>
Ain't trying to see no black man turn into John Gotti<br/>
My daughter use a potty so she's older now<br/>
Educated street knowledge I'm gonna mold 'er now<br/>
Trick 'er little dope buying young girls tringes<br/>
Dealing with the dope fiend binges<br/>
Seeing syringes in the veins<br/>
Hard to explain how I maintain<br/>
The crack smoke makes my brain feel so strange<br/>
Breaking days on the set no sweat from cold moet<br/>
Can't bag yet because's still wet<br/>
But when I dry back in five at a time<br/>
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line<br/>
I had to burst on the third<br/>
Rehearse that's my word<br/>
Thinking the game Ds knew my first name<br/>
Should I quit? Shit no!<br/>
Even though they had me scared<br/>
Yo they gotta eight I gotta teck with air holes<br/>
<br/>
That's just how the shit goes in the struggle mother fucker<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna live no mo'<br/>
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'<br/>
I'm living everyday like a hustle<br/>
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle
