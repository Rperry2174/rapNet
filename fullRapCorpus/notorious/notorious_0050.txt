"Well it's the Funk Docta Spock.."<br/>
"Meth-Tical.."<br/>
"Biggie.. Biggie.." (mmmhmmmmmm)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..<br/>
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches<br/>
the prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit<br/>
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches<br/>
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it<br/>
So I grab it, never run, the outcome<br/>
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be<br/>
or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast<br/>
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?<br/>
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out<br/>
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth<br/>
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented<br/>
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin<br/>
I could chill, the heat doesn't<br/>
Ran up in your shell about a dozen<br/>
You never see bank like Frank White<br/>
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate<br/>
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
Yo.. yo yo<br/>
I don't brownnose out of town hoes<br/>
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh<br/>
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect<br/>
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes<br/>
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear<br/>
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here<br/>
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off<br/>
I stopped trustin niggaz since Gotti got caught<br/>
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored<br/>
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother<br/>
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too<br/>
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue<br/>
The Doc was born with a grenade palm<br/>
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom<br/>
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy<br/>
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high<br/>
<br/>
"This rule is so underrated.." -&gt; <i>[B.I.G.]</i><br/>
"Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin" -&gt; <i>[Meth]</i><br/>
"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.." -&gt; <i>[B.I.G.]</i><br/>
"Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon" -&gt; <i>[B.I.G.]</i><br/>
<i>[repeat all 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh<br/>
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys<br/>
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed<br/>
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks<br/>
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops<br/>
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance<br/>
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants<br/>
from Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion<br/>
Bitches get naked off "Get Money", "Player's Anthem"<br/>
Don't forget, "One More Chance" and, my other hits, other shit<br/>
niggaz spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually<br/>
in and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me<br/>
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin blasphemy<br/>
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often<br/>
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla<br/>
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer<br/>
slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Method Man]</i><br/>
Now now<br/>
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket<br/>
I take these adolescents back to Spofford<br/>
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side<br/>
that's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines;<br/>
bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty<br/>
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers<br/>
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid<br/>
until they got love for my music<br/>
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes<br/>
and three charges, I got to "See-three-P.O.'s"<br/>
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel<br/>
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggaz swingin swords in the WAR<br/>
that's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up<br/>
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky<br/>
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye<br/>
New York Shitty, put they weight on it<br/>
And who better for the job than Biggie?  The Notorious<br/>
Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches<br/>
and touch individual, small frame buck and change<br/>
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain<br/>
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin<br/>
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin<br/>
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door<br/>
to kill the bullshit like a matador<br/>
Keep your hands high (what?)
