<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
So you wanna be hardcore <br/>
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps <br/>
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal <br/>
that you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin <br/>
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some<br/>
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some <br/>
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy <br/>
I get up in that ass like a wedgie<br/>
Says who? Says me, the lyrical <br/>
Niggaz sayin, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle" <br/>
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me <br/>
Just for niggaz actin shifty <br/>
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker <br/>
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor <br/>
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is <br/>
natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates <br/>
The funk baby <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (repeats 8X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk" (LOTUG, Chief Rocka) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
All I want is bitches, big booty bitches <br/>
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches <br/>
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches <br/>
from stayin in my business, what is this?  Relentless <br/>
approach, to know if I'm broke or not <br/>
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot <br/>
Don't mean I don't tote the glock <br/>
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen <br/>
Until we motherfuckin meet again <br/>
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now <br/>
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now <br/>
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats <br/>
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats <br/>
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens) <br/>
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof <br/>
Hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks <br/>
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick <br/>
The funk baby <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side <br/>
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside <br/>
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests <br/>
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test <br/>
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya <br/>
High as a motherfuckin helicopter <br/>
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor <br/>
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina <br/>
(What's Love, Got to Do)<br/>
when I'm rippin all through your whole crew <br/>
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns <br/>
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons <br/>
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life <br/>
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes<br/>
It's type simple and plain to maintain <br/>
I add a little funk to the brain <br/>
The funk baby <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat chorus]</i>
