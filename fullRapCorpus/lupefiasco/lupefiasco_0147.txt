<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Uhh, I just need a minute to replenish who I am<br/>
And who I am is so dependent on exactly where we stand<br/>
I stand in any pose, anything but tippy-toes<br/>
But don't want you to feel smaller, always taller<br/>
Now I'm a cheerleader, she a baller<br/>
The difference in height isn't aight, I left my ego at the alter<br/>
Now every ring's a sting and everything I taught ya<br/>
Is coming back around to me, just like revolvers<br/>
And every single click is just hammering it home<br/>
Who knew Russian roulette involved answering the phone?<br/>
Until my signal dwindles or my channel is in roam<br/>
Or my cellphone dies or it's cancer in my dome<br/>
And dear nix the tone, as I pull my fuckinâ€™ pain out<br/>
One of your short nodes, might blow my fuckin' brains out<br/>
But you ain't even pick up<br/>
Talking to myself, exactly what you sick of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook 1: Eric Turner]</i><br/>
Feeling kinda restless<br/>
Did you get my message?<br/>
It's swirling around and so<br/>
No, don't tell me that you care<br/>
When I know you're standing there<br/>
I left the story of my life on your answering machine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Eric Turner]</i><br/>
Hello, can you hear me?<br/>
Hello, are you there?<br/>
Hello, would you pick up the phone?<br/>
Hello, can you hear me?<br/>
Hello, are you there?<br/>
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
We were like, if a tree falls in the forest and<br/>
No one is around, does it really make a sound?<br/>
That's romantic and profound, but now<br/>
We're like lumberjacks holding the axes that brung it down<br/>
So I'm now on your message, talm 'bout "Remember?"<br/>
Silence in return, that sound like 'Timber!"<br/>
There's some that can't see the forest because they're liars<br/>
But I can't see the forest cause of the fire<br/>
And in our prehistorics, the flowers was rooting for us<br/>
Brontosaurus ate the flowers, T-Rex ate the Brontosaurus<br/>
And then the T-Rex turned around and ate the florist<br/>
That's why I lost my FTD endorsements<br/>
But that's really not important<br/>
My sadness' a snitch, my melancholy informant<br/>
Despair wears a wire, my longing rapping a song<br/>
My worry is a rat, my lonely tapping the phone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook 2: Eric Turner]</i><br/>
Feeling kinda restless<br/>
Did you get my message?<br/>
It's swirling around and so<br/>
I wanna give you reasons<br/>
Tell you what I'm feeling<br/>
But none of these lines are secure<br/>
No, don't tell me that you care<br/>
When I know you're standing there<br/>
I left the story of my life on your answering machine<br/>
My tears run off your shoes<br/>
Like waters from a goose<br/>
You try to wash off all the dirt<br/>
But your hands aren't getting clean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Eric Turner]</i><br/>
Hello, can you hear me?<br/>
Hello, are you there?<br/>
Hello, would you pick up the phone?<br/>
Hello, can you hear me?<br/>
Hello, are you there?<br/>
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
The make-believers on receivers as you sit back and observe<br/>
As the rubber curly cord just absorbs all my words<br/>
Will you collect us then connect us or neglect us on the whole<br/>
Into the wall, then cross the wires on the telephone poles<br/>
Then bounces off the towers, then up into the satellites<br/>
Then falls down back to Earth to bring a broken heart back to life<br/>
Happens all the time, lost an appetite and lack of sleep<br/>
If it's dead and flatten line, I'll leave a message at the beep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Eric Turner]</i><br/>
Hello, can you hear me?<br/>
Hello, are you there?<br/>
Hello, would you pick up the phone?<br/>
Hello, can you hear me?<br/>
Hello, are you there?<br/>
Hello, would you pick up the phone?<br/>
Would you pick up the phone?<br/>
Would you pick up the phone?<br/>
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?
