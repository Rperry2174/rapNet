Thank you! Uh, check, check<br/>
<br/>
When you got popped up and you got locked up<br/>
And the block shot up and your girl knocked up<br/>
And your kids be like, "Who gonna watch us?"<br/>
Your mama, they nana<br/>
When you ball too hard or your money got spent<br/>
So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent<br/>
But you still had a place where you could go<br/>
Tell me where you went, your mama<br/>
Soon as they let me outta jail<br/>
Went straight to my mama's house<br/>
Need someone I can talk to<br/>
And a little more time to work all these dramas out<br/>
That lawyer money, that bail money<br/>
Those letters in the mail never fail you, homie<br/>
Who visit when niggas don't visit?<br/>
Man she the realest<br/>
Boy let me tell you somethin'<br/>
You better love your mama<br/>
<br/>
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)<br/>
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)<br/>
More than I love my health and I love my wealth<br/>
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches<br/>
And I love my car<br/>
More than I love my heart<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, now some mamas might be your confidant<br/>
Some mamas just good for shoes<br/>
Some mamas might be your drinkin' buddy<br/>
Some mamas might not be cool<br/>
Some mamas might wait 'til you get home<br/>
Some mamas might come up to your school<br/>
And fuck you up in front of your friends<br/>
'Cause you don't make the rules<br/>
Really thought that you was doin' it today<br/>
Now you sittin' there lookin' all stupid in your face<br/>
When you get home just tell her you're sorry<br/>
And put on this song, start movin' to the bass<br/>
Boy cut that shit off<br/>
Goddamn, mama, they made this song for you<br/>
Said through the powder and the problems<br/>
Gotta honor my mama<br/>
So that's what I'm tryna do<br/>
<br/>
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)<br/>
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)<br/>
More than I love my health and I love my wealth<br/>
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches<br/>
And I love my car<br/>
More than I love my heart<br/>
<br/>
Now some might think their mama ain't perfect<br/>
She is<br/>
All in her face, better get in your place<br/>
You're one of her goddamn kids<br/>
Now some might think their mama ain't worth it<br/>
She is<br/>
Gotta help her out no matter what it's 'bout<br/>
No matter whatever she did<br/>
Now some might think their mama ain't here<br/>
She lives...<br/>
<br/>
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)<br/>
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)<br/>
More than I love my health and I love my wealth<br/>
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches<br/>
And I love my car<br/>
More than I love my heart
