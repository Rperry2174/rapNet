Yeah, whoooo,<br/>
What up chitown?  Nyc? Philly, Atlanta, Virginia,<br/>
They said it was coming back around man,<br/>
Back to the lyrics man.<br/>
Back to people like me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's mean, so just<br/>
Now let me put the streets down like steam rollers<br/>
With the cats that push 40 ounces through the hood<br/>
Like king cobra, see me sling soda<br/>
Cause the extra foam in the split is mix<br/>
(It's really 36)<br/>
Used to buy toasters and clips<br/>
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict<br/>
While you was lightin' your purple I was over the scripts<br/>
See, I couldn't walk the walk<br/>
Couldn't really talk the talk<br/>
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk<br/>
Cause this lack in talk had my walk lookin' off<br/>
Now I'm over the limp<br/>
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my verbals able<br/>
(that's the usual)<br/>
When I was po' I was low,<br/>
Now me and my chops cop purple label<br/>
It's Ralph Lauren on the rap noreat?<br/>
Niggas brown-nose, they are like alf to him<br/>
Runners and interscopers not as styled as him<br/>
Please don't interscope<br/>
It's gonna be a whole lotta IV-ing and respiratin'<br/>
If I lean out this window with Irene<br/>
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming<br/>
Will LUP emperor?<br/>
It's the foundation, I-beams and the antennas<br/>
It's so serious every time I write my John Hancock<br/>
Like, you could damn near see Detroit (I see you)<br/>
Niggas is scared of heights (see you)<br/>
This is saran wrap and aluminum foil<br/>
Some potpourri a little machine oil<br/>
I stack my paper and throw off my six?<br/>
This is top flo', better look out below<br/>
Pennys from heaven is the same as a semi from the sect<br/>
And I reign supreme<br/>
Turn your umbrellas upside down<br/>
Did you even catch the change in theme?<br/>
(this is gangsta)<br/>
Lupe to the F to the I to the A to the S to the C to the O<br/>
From the west side of the C to the H to the I CA to the G to the O<br/>
(this is gangsta, man)<br/>
This is gangsta, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And them niggas ain't watch<br/>
Known from him regime, gangsta lean<br/>
Hats on tilt like his sneakers ain't drop out the vending machine<br/>
You gotta put more money in<br/>
And I shake niggas up everytime I drop a bar<br/>
It's horse in the Porsche, bricks in the box<br/>
Like more money them every time I cop a car<br/>
You see I'm a roller, right?<br/>
So it might be a rover, right?<br/>
But every time I drop a 'r' get off the streets<br/>
It's over, aight?<br/>
Better being ahead like overnight<br/>
Like rollers, right, she the chauffeur, right?<br/>
So I keep her sober<br/>
She don't get FedEx like overnight<br/>
I am dole the might<br/>
All that gas can't help, but sold the mic<br/>
So just call on somethin'<br/>
Drop a 's' pick up a 'o', you know, put it all on one<br/>
Then brace yourself like overbite<br/>
For that quiet nigga that relocated down south<br/>
Comin' back to floss, nigga get your molars right<br/>
Fix your grill<br/>
No plaque but a whole lotta cheese<br/>
This the drill, Mr. Chill gave me the green light<br/>
Like yo the knife<br/>
So Ima force my will like the force I will<br/>
Of course you will<br/>
Take my time but wait behind only pertains to that Porsche grill<br/>
It's snakes in the hood, gotta watch for that cobra bite<br/>
Let me see, there's snakes in the hood<br/>
A bird, a horse behind the grill<br/>
Some gator on the seat and a fox behind the wheel<br/>
No it's not Noah's ark (ark), It's just a flower's start<br/>
This is Lupe to the F to the I to the A to the S to the C to the O<br/>
From the West side of the C to the H to the I CA to the G to the O<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
For achiever, my procedures proceed at all cost<br/>
With no breather<br/>
I'm all walk, rain, snow, a fever<br/>
I'm all coughs, coming after your teacher<br/>
I'm on the ball like FIFA, Feva, Lupe, Diche,<br/>
Long live the leaders<br/>
I remember I ain't have sneakers, it was welfare<br/>
Comin' up for air like whales there<br/>
Fila's, but now I'm well here<br/>
I'm Shamu with twelve pair<br/>
And niggas wanna take me back to zero like tear, fair<br/>
Well, my scale's clear<br/>
Your 'see' world is Braille here<br/>
I'm Bumpy Johnson, I stick to the streets<br/>
Keep my dawgs out in front of me<br/>
See what I'm sayin'? and I push keys wonderfully
