<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
FNF<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
Hello darkness, hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all the time<br/>
Hello no where, hello oblivion, hello goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Hello Darkness<br/>
You <i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
All in together the weather is better than ever<br/>
I hope it never ends I hope it lasts forever<br/>
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's better than it's ever been<br/>
Lie to ourselves like the sky to rebel<br/>
And its well and its fine and its fine if it fell<br/>
And you couldn't find the story line if you survive to retell<br/>
We are targets, Hello darkness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe mumbling]</i><br/>
Said everything is going to be fine<br/>
Said everything is gonna be OK<br/>
Said just don't breathe the air<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
He just sits and waits for them to kick in the door<br/>
He once was a hero they don't love him no more<br/>
There's a blast, every time a foot hits the floor<br/>
His gift for not fighting another man's war<br/>
And if they can get their hands on the mask that he wore<br/>
On his face, they can put somebody else in his place and restore<br/>
The state, the illusion that its safe<br/>
the faith, that being a slave is so great<br/>
As gas fills the room and rockets destroy everything around him<br/>
He stands to find himself surround<br/>
By thousands of soldiers that his once trained to never miss their targets<br/>
Heartless, Hello Darkness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Unkle]</i><br/>
Hello Darkness<br/>
<br/>
Please to make your acquaintance<br/>
Salutations, Konnichiwa<br/>
Hello end of the world, how are you, I'm fine<br/>
<br/>
Hey there darkness, hey there sunshine,<br/>
hello not at all, hello all the time<br/>
Hello no where, hello oblivion,<br/>
hello goodbye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hello darkness, hello sunshine<br/>
Detonate, uncool
