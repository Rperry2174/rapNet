Hey now<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
Sneakers beep a heater underneath the seam<br/>
On the jeans every time I hit the scene<br/>
Like Mira<br/>
Look at me crook I be<br/>
Like ya neck when you slept wrong the American dream<br/>
Don’t step on the block that I run<br/>
Block that I brung the first beamer that they’d ever seen on these<br/>
Wit with the rocks I sling like David<br/>
Fee Fi Fo Fum<br/>
By nature I’m a hustla<br/>
Move pack like I move and I’m packing<br/>
Y’all niggas move back on the come up like elevator action<br/>
Welcome to the action-packed world of trapping<br/>
Where we tip into Chi-Town if you cook a key you will see<br/>
If you chop the nickels that you can get a drop and a box of pistols<br/>
Have to get it cooked so you can not get little<br/>
Fast (echo)<br/>
Money (echo)<br/>
‘cause all my habits important<br/>
I kept the illest hoopers in high school and Jordans<br/>
Kept the illest rappers in the hood recording<br/>
See I keep it real no I no bluffin’<br/>
I got money but I no puff them<br/>
I re-up remove weight like liposuction<br/>
Now follow a playa as I go hustling<br/>
For that fast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<i>[Guitar Wayne:]</i><br/>
Fast money baby<br/>
Money (echo)<br/>
Fast as it comes or faster<br/>
When the closet close<br/>
Then you’re on your own check<br/>
Can you dig it baby?<br/>
Woooohooo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
Now let’s see what happens when a little mackin and a little Cadillacin’ get it crackalackin on the scene like shush<br/>
Rings gators on seen the suits when I sneak<br/>
Man I pack shit for a king<br/>
Such as I<br/>
Uh, uh you try<br/>
See haters try to touch they uh, uh deny<br/>
This is not for the weak of heart like John Q<br/>
You’re just a John to that blonde who wants you<br/>
I’m cut from a finer cloth<br/>
See it’s pimpin’ in my blood<br/>
Know how much that vagina costs<br/>
If a playa suspect the game gon’ reject him<br/>
Welcome to the world’s oldest profession<br/>
We running game in the Chi-Town<br/>
Most niggas lame cuz they can’t accept it<br/>
They can never understand so they can’t respect it<br/>
They can never feel my pain cuz they can’t connect with it<br/>
Fast (echo)<br/>
Money (echo)<br/>
Pimps up hoes down<br/>
Why you trying to get that ho to swallow<br/>
If you get a brain then the hoes will follow<br/>
Uh, I keep it real see I know pimpin’<br/>
I tell them what they want cuz I know women<br/>
They better have my cash or I go tripping<br/>
Now follow a playa as I go hustling<br/>
For that fast<br/>
<br/>
