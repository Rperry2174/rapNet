All g ball on the ball soundtrack on the track Gemini on the job Shayla g on the g Sarah green<br/>
for the green free chilly<br/>
And I'm back on my thing for the listeners<br/>
What you are about to to witness is<br/>
Lu new valuable album 2<br/>
Get ready for the ghetto ghetto images<br/>
<br/>
From the m-a-d-i to the s to the o-n<br/>
Potent to get you open<br/>
Move like a nigga supposed to<br/>
Get your dough on the go with the flow<br/>
That I'm holding<br/>

Love, got the windy city on my back<br/>
So I'm back on my grizzle like a bearskin rug<br/>
Put some lain on the floor blame it on the goat<br/>
Little rapper turn it out cause I'm very pluh<br/>
I convert I can work anywhere any word you can ask my brother huh<br/>
He'll concur that I'm sers with the worst with the man up above thank you very much<br/>
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at like an a in a circle with a pay little erkel<br/>
What they say when they see og from the f to the f to the amazing verbals<br/>
They race in circles like they raisin a gerbil<br/>
I race in a circle like I'm raisin a horse<br/>
I'm racing a Porsche while they racing in place<br/>
They race in a cage I race on a course<br/>
COURSE<br/>
That case in the court did not defer the dream<br/>
I am still a raisin in the sun raging against the machine<br/>
<br/>
From the m-a-d-i to the s to the o-n<br/>
Potent to get you open<br/>
Move like a nigga supposed to<br/>
Get your dough on the go with the flow<br/>
That I'm holding<br/>

Rock genuine time not de lacoste<br/>

Little rap is like azemof<br/>
I let my momma into rhyming and she raised me off<br/>
A 80s baby on file like a safety off<br/>
Got my hood riding high on 28s<br/>
Off of everything that's gonna be like a 84<br/>
And they in love with him and I'm in love with them<br/>
And we never ride dubs again<br/>
No we won't<br/>
Tryna get above the rim<br/>
A little too short to dunk<br/>
So we donk<br/>
From the m-a-d-i to the s to the o-n<br/>
Potent to get you open<br/>
Move like a nigga supposed to<br/>
Get your dough on the go with the flow<br/>

I'm on my go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow<br/>
I got my go go go go go go go go gadget flow<br/>
