Close your mind<br/>
close your eyes<br/>
see with your heart<br/>
how do you forgive the murderer of your father?<br/>
the ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more than the blood of a martyr<br/>
<br/>
we came through the storm nooses on our necks<br/>
and a smallpox blanket to keep us warm<br/>
on a 747 on the pentagon lawn<br/>
wake up the alarm clock is connected to a bomb<br/>
anthrax lab on a w. Virginia farm<br/>
shorty ain't learned to walk already heavily armed<br/>
civilians and little children is especially harmed<br/>
camouflaged Torahs, Bibles and glorious qurans<br/>
the books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there<br/>
have become misinterpreted, reasons for warfare<br/>
we read 'em with blind eyes I guarantee you there's more there<br/>
the rich must be blind because they didn't see the poor there<br/>
need to open up a park, just close 10 schools<br/>
we don't need 'em<br/>
can you please call the fire department they're down here marching for freedom<br/>
burn down their TV's, turn their TV's on to teach 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
The more money that they make<br/>
the more money that they make<br/>
the better and better they live<br/>
whatever they wanna take<br/>
whatever they wanna take<br/>
whatever whatever it is<br/>
the more that you wanna learn<br/>
the more that you try to learn<br/>
the better and better it gets<br/>
American Terrorist<br/>
(Terror)<br/>
<br/>
now the poor klu klux man see that we're all brothers not because things are the same because we lack the same<br/>
color that's green, now that's mean<br/>
cant burn his cross cause he can't afford the gasoline<br/>
now if a Muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus<br/>
with the seconds running give you the jitters?<br/>
just imagine an American-based Christian organization planning to poison water supplies to bring the second-coming quicker<br/>
nigga they ain't living properly<br/>
break 'em off a little democracy<br/>
turn their whole culture to a mockery<br/>
give 'em Coca-Cola for their property<br/>
give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun<br/>
if they ain't giving it up, then they ain't getting none and don't give 'em all naw, man, just give 'em some its<br/>
the paper, some of these cops must be al-qaeda<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS (2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's like<br/>
don't give the black man food, give red man liquor<br/>
red man fool, black man nigga<br/>
give yellow man tool, make him railroad builder<br/>
also give him pan, make him pull gold from river give black man crack, glocks and things, give red man<br/>
craps, slot machines...
