<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm fearless<br/>
Now hear this<br/>
I'm earless<br/>
And I'm peerless<br/>
That means I'm eyeless<br/>
Which means I'm tearless<br/>
Which means my iris resides where my ears is<br/>
Which means I'm blinded<br/>
But I'm gonna find it I can feel it's nearness<br/>
But I'm gonna veer so I don't come near<br/>
Like a chicken or a deer<br/>
But I remember I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear<br/>
Here, you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this, clearly cause my blindness<br/>
The windshield is minstrel, the whole grill is roadkill, so trill and so sincere. Yeah, I'm<br/>
Both them there<br/>
Took both pills, when a bloke in a trench coat and the locs in the chair had approached him<br/>
Here<br/>
And he clear as a ghost, so a biter of the throats in the mirror<br/>
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts who supplier of the notes to the living<br/>
Riveting is rosy, pockets full of posies, given to the mother of the deceased. Awaken at war,<br/>
'til I'm restin' in peace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1:]</i><br/>
You goin' over niggas' heads Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
They tellin' me that they don't feel you (Dumb it down)<br/>
We ain't graduate from school nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
Them big words ain't cool nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
Yeah I heard Mean And Vicious nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
Make a song for the bitches nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
We don't care about the weather nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
You'll sell more records if you (Dumb it down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And I'm mouthless<br/>
Which means I'm soundless<br/>
Now as far as the hearing, I've found it<br/>
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is<br/>
But the doorknockers on the ear of a stewardess in a Lear<br/>
She fine and she flying, I feel I'm flying by'em 'cause my mind's on cloud nine and I'm a mime<br/>
At the same time<br/>
Pimps C the wings on the underground king<br/>
Who's also Klingon<br/>
To infinity and beyond<br/>
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon<br/>
Or lying in the desert<br/>
I'm flying on Pegasus you're flying on the pheasant<br/>
Rider of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers, spit hot fire like Dylon on Chappelle's<br/>
Skit<br/>
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn, snort the white horse, but toot my own horn (sleep)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
You've been shedding too much light Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
You make'em wanna do right Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
They're getting self-esteem Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
These girls are trying to be queens Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
They're trying to graduate from school Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
They're starting to think that smart is cool Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
They're trying to get up out the hood Lu (Dumb it down)<br/>
I'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And I'm brainless<br/>
Which means I'm headless<br/>
Like Ichabod Crane is<br/>
Or foreplay-less sex is<br/>
Which makes me stainless<br/>
With no neck left to hang the chain with<br/>
Which makes me necklace-less<br/>
Like a necklace theft<br/>
And I ain't used my headrest yet<br/>
They said they need proof like a vestless chest 'bout the best, fair F-F-jet in the nest<br/>
Who exudes confidence and excess depth<br/>
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe<br/>
Around these leagues<br/>
My snorkle is a tuba, Lu the ruler around these seas<br/>
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside'em, chest high and rising<br/>
Almost touching the knees of stewardess and the pilot<br/>
Lucky they make it flowered<br/>
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves<br/>
David Blaine<br/>
Make it rain<br/>
Make a boat<br/>
I make a plane<br/>
Then, I pull the plug and I make it drain<br/>
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again..(Westside)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3:]</i><br/>
You putting me to sleep nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
That's why you ain't popping in the streets nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
You ain't winning no awards nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
Robots and skateboards nigga? (Dumb it down)<br/>
GQ Man Of The Year G? (Dumb it down)<br/>
Shit ain't rocking over here B (Dumb it down)<br/>
Won't you talk about your cars nigga? (Dumb it down)<br/>
What the fuck is goyard nigga (Dumb it down)<br/>
Make it rain for the chicks (Dumb it down)<br/>
Pour champagne on a bitch (Dumb it down)<br/>
What the fuck is wrong with you? (Dumb it down)<br/>
How can I get on a song with you? (Dumb it down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gemini: talking]</i><br/>
Look B, here's my man, my two way, (hey) uh, what should I - ah here take this (hey) that<br/>
Right there, fuck what my boys talking about nigga, (hey) nigga you hot to me, I like you (Dumb<br/>
It down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe:]</i><br/>
Bishop G, they told me I should come down cousin, but I flatly refuse I ain't dumb down nothing
