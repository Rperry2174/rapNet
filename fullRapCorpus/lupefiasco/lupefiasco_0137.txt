Yeah, and it got a soul, yeah<br/>
Uh-uh, what it do, what it say<br/>
Yeah, yeah, Drogas, Drogas, what it say<br/>
Yeah, yeah, Drogas, Drogas, what it say<br/>
What it say, Drogas, Drogas<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Dro', Dro', Dro', trap, trap, Dro', Dro'<br/>
Dro', Dro', Dro', nigga, uh<br/>
What it say, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Blood rushin' to my head like coal<br/>
Plains on my mind like shade<br/>
Planes on my mind like stage<br/>
Stays for a while like fades<br/>
Fades to the block like Js<br/>
Waitin' from behind like Ks<br/>
Made it from behind like AIDS<br/>
Made it to the map like Waze<br/>
Take it to the trap like maze<br/>
Can't take you back like trays<br/>
Bae shake it in my leather jacket, Jonah<br/>
'Cause you're havin' seizures, Jesus<br/>
What's a nonbeliever to a preacher?<br/>
This is ain't the kind of rap the opps and the thots like<br/>
Told Trak put the bat back on the spotlight<br/>
Cartagena, serve snacks at the cockfight (realest)<br/>
Need new batteries for the Glock lights (realest)<br/>
Put the mix on the oil 'til it lock tight (realest)<br/>
'Cause they gave it to all the young niggas<br/>
Drogas dedicated to all the drug dealers<br/>
Find out how, now ya'll gon' come kill us<br/>
Try Containment Unit, the walls, they can't fit us<br/>
Who the Ghostbusters gon' call to come get us?<br/>
<br/>
Ayy, over-D off of this<br/>
But baby, don't die 'til the dopamine hit, yo<br/>
Ayy, this one ain't for Billbo'<br/>
You can stream the album on Silk Road<br/>
Drug rings for more dough<br/>
So they baggin' like Bilbo<br/>
Jackin' like Jill for a pill at the Hollywood Hills, though<br/>
Famous dritter<br/>
I want my name all lit up<br/>
And leave out the world how I came, in the clear<br/>
Over-D off of this<br/>
But don't fall asleep 'til the dopamine hit, hey<br/>
<br/>
Drogas, Drogas, what it say, what it say<br/>
Drogas, Drogas, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Dro', Dro', Dro', trap, trap, Dro', Dro'<br/>
Dro', Dro', Dro', nigga<br/>
Drogas, Drogas, what it say, what it say<br/>
Drogas, Drogas, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Dro', Dro', Dro', trap, trap, Dro', Dro'<br/>
Dro', Dro', Dro', nigga<br/>
<br/>
Big watch, big watch, you can see it<br/>
Lot of diamonds in the Cartier<br/>
'Less I'm thinkin' 'bout the money, I can't concentrate<br/>
Don't talk if you ain't ball enough to commentate, yeah<br/>
That's a Super Bowl every time I contemplate<br/>
Limited edition, bitches<br/>
I'm just livin' off the interest<br/>
I don't really care about niggas<br/>
Denzel put the money in the bandos<br/>
For the es√©s, shower posse with the SKs<br/>
For the haters that be hatin' on the Hefes<br/>
Half-naked hoes, they be dressin' just like X-rays<br/>
Rated, all the way through, don't like nothin' play this<br/>
Simps think they got cool, I'm just stickin' to the basics<br/>
<br/>
This-this-this-this-this-this-this...<br/>
This one ain't for Billbo'<br/>
You can stream the album on Silk Road<br/>
Drug rings for more dough<br/>
So they baggin' like Bilbo<br/>
Jackin' like Jill for a pill at the Hollywood Hills, though<br/>
Famous dritter<br/>
I want my name all lit up<br/>
And leave out the world how I came, in the clear<br/>
Over-D off of this<br/>
But don't fall asleep 'til the dopamine hit, hey
