On another track don't want none of dat that,<br/>
With no water and no slaughter<br/>
No breaks I just continue on, but no takes,<br/>
I keep going, keep flowing, no stopping dat<br/>
You see everybody watching dat,<br/>
You see I got the lock so I'll be lockin dat, you can't get the keys<br/>
Especially from me, I keep em so tight in my the pocket,<br/>
You'd better watch it, as a matter of fact you'd better stop it,<br/>
I'm too hot, better hop scotch it and go up down the block, or you might catch a shot, one two - plah, plah<br/>
<br/>
My flow is like …I'm straight..<br/>
For your face when I come through…<br/>
I ant hear the hearts, I'm just aimin for the brains<br/>
Tryin to make em smart and take em outta dangers way<br/>
I say maintain the day,<br/>
I show the shoulders how to maintain the way to sole righteous<br/>
The nicest, and do it like its pricesless, iceless<br/>
No, I got a couple those watch us in a couple cars,<br/>
And I keep a couple flows in a couple bars,<br/>
And I keep a couple hoods in a couple stars,<br/>
And my bag pocket you can bag watch it,<br/>
You better bag stop it like its cricky,<br/>
I keep a wicky doogly when I stick it, be like the bat man itchy<br/>
You can come through just like don't pinch it out<br/>
I'll knock it out the park it be so dark <br/>
By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun<br/>
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty,<br/>
I'll still be there rhymin see it don't tip me,<br/>
I don't feel guilty either, I feel so filthy when I..,<br/>
Flowin like ether Burnin that shit down and turnin them broads around<br/>
And showin em there's better ways to get it down<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling like an ipod look at my god, I got my head down to heaven<br/>
See I pray to the east, I try to do it seven times a day<br/>
Do my way, may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do<br/>
And for the fast that I didn't fast<br/>
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them,<br/>
Or if not, keep so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about the success or the change<br/>
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let em doubt you,<br/>
Don't ever let em try to put the mouth to the violence, the silence,<br/>
That I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes<br/>
And they can watch if they want to<br/>
See us gonna haunt you<br/>
The ghosts of the past come through so fast<br/>
You lay em down but the they can't <br/>
You try to put it in the trash but it jumps out the garbage<br/>
Yet it still returns to be the hardest on the market.
