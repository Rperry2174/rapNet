<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
F'n'F up all day (all day)<br/>
Young pro is on the cut always (always)<br/>
If you represent your set when you're rolling through the jets<br/>
Take your fingers off your triggers keep your hands of your Tecs. Check it<br/>
<br/>
I'm really gnarly<br/>
Really harder than tryna wheely Harleys<br/>
I will leave hardly, life of the party<br/>
Hotter than Saudis in furs in the Mojave<br/>
Don't make me catch a body<br/>
<i>[Silenced gun shots, body hitting the floor]</i><br/>
<br/>
F'n'F up all day (all day)<br/>
Young pro is on the cut always (always)<br/>
If you represent your set when you're rolling through the jets<br/>
Take your fingers off your triggers keep your hands of your techs. Check it<br/>
<br/>
I'm really gnarly<br/>
Really harder than tryna wheely Harleys<br/>
I will leave hardly, life of the party<br/>
Hotter than Saudis in furs in the Mojave<br/>
Don't make me catch a body<br/>
First and Fifteenth probably<br/>
Playa don't trip when the clique's in the party<br/>
You trip, then it kick, like Mr. Miyagi<br/>
I brought an extra clip in event of a robbery<br/>
You flinch then it click like Clint, Dirty Harry<br/>
Don't think that my money gettin' spent on Ferraris<br/>
This game that was told is old as Ataris<br/>
You sold into slavery<br/>
The system I pimps, I limps like a Charley<br/>
Horse. Bring the chorus!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Ain't it boss, playa?<br/>
Homie, don't it be like that<br/>
When it be like that<br/>
When it's G like that?<br/>
Ain't it boss, playa?<br/>
Homie you can't leave like that<br/>
When you bleed like that<br/>
You won't be right back<br/>
Ain't it boss, playa?<br/>
What, you think we freeze right up<br/>
When you breeze right up?<br/>
Don't you bleed like us?<br/>
Ain't it boss, playa?<br/>
Paper makin' on top<br/>
Playa hatin' won't stop<br/>
Percolatin' on lock<br/>
Ain't it boss, playa?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
If it's getting too hot<br/>
Better go'on out the galley<br/>
I'm a top cat, homes<br/>
Got a phone in the alley<br/>
And I locks that down<br/>
When I zone, understand me<br/>
And I drop rap poems<br/>
Like domes on the Caddy<br/>
When the top back<br/>
Go'on better stop that<br/>
Like cops when you clock that<br/>
Brougham goin' over the speed limit<br/>
You spot that<br/>
Somethin's been thrown like bones<br/>
And you combin' for baggies<br/>
And you see it's weed in his seat<br/>
Me an' my man G<br/>
Had a home in the valley<br/>
And I just left New York<br/>
And I'm goin' back to Cali<br/>
Where I chop that, yup<br/>
Gotta bone me a sal'ry<br/>
And I'm back in the cut<br/>
Still hungry as Shaggy<br/>
Like I need that<br/>
So free that the fee that<br/>
See that keep it copasetic<br/>
Don't do nothin' sudden<br/>
Push the button<br/>
Hustlin' to keep my leverage, uh!<br/>
You can't destroy me<br/>
Know who them boys be?<br/>
I ain't no employee!<br/>
I'm the boss, playa!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Gemstones]</i><br/>
I'm pimpin' with playas that be pimpin'<br/>
I'm pimpin' this broad<br/>
But how could one man be so pimpin'?<br/>
Shit-if pimpin' is hard<br/>
Cuz goofies<br/>
Kill for that nookie even clap at they dogs<br/>
Givin' they<br/>
Heart to these chickens, I'm unstrappin' they bras<br/>
Lendin' they<br/>
Cars to these chickens even platinum cards<br/>
All in the<br/>
Mall with these chickens puttin' carats on arms<br/>
I have 'em<br/>
Posin' in pictures with my shaft in they jaws<br/>
Laughin' cuz dro in my system<br/>
Plus I'm havin' a ball<br/>
Coulda been somewhere with open liquor<br/>
Drivin' the Porsche<br/>
Ain't too many rich as flows as this in Robber Report<br/>
Properties bought<br/>
Believe I seen that watch in the sauce<br/>
Hot but his force<br/>
Monopoly's my hobby and yours'<br/>
Probably sports!<br/>
It's obvious you saw me. Get lost!<br/>
Give me some privacy<br/>
See how many rocks in that cross<br/>
You think of robbin' me<br/>
But you don't want no problems young boy<br/>
You wanna ride with me<br/>
Make a choice the option is yours<br/>
Ain't it boss, playa?<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 4: Bishop G]</i><br/>
Man the game ain't the same since the 'caine done stopped<br/>
DEA's done slowed up the game 'round near Brainerd Park<br/>
'Bout the same time Greg<br/>
Got shot in the head<br/>
Nigga Pack got his momma's house<br/>
Took by the feds<br/>
But of course what you expect<br/>
When you pitchin' where you rest<br/>
Holdin' rocks beneath your tongue<br/>
Wearin' slippers on your steps<br/>
But for what? A couple pennies<br/>
Not enough to by a semi<br/>
So the corners of the dean was racin' niggas yellin 'Gimmie'<br/>
That reminds me little Kenny got shot three months ago (damn.)<br/>
Fresh out the hospital; shot three weeks ago (damn!)<br/>
Come to find out only difference from the first<br/>
Was the niggas that just got him ain't no different from the first<br/>
And I wonder whatta happened to his crazy brother Spider<br/>
Used to be my 'lil roadie back in 1995 so<br/>
Last I heard he's doin' robbin'<br/>
Shot some nigga in the Gardens<br/>
He sat in the body cast behind the glass next to the sergeant<br/>
<br/>
