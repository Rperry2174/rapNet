Sometimes dreams, peace of paper I got reams<br/>
Where the D go?, Put that on a rose and now you<br/>
Pronounce it hero, U see?<br/>
Lu see like La Brea &amp; Pico, with binoculars on my peephole<br/>
I feel my best work was album zero<br/>
Now with Deniro its boo boo in my backyard and<br/>
Ben burnt down my gazebo that Deniro's ah casino<br/>
Wit spit in the sandwich of the police though<br/>
They ain't see the steel plate up under my seat though<br/>
Still play it like Shaquille but I can free throw<br/>
I ain't playing but I compete, I ain't a player but I'm complete<br/>
And that's the win winner mason mind can't sign if the pens Templar<br/>
Night vision on white linen is still green<br/>
Peace of Paper I got reams, make it rain<br/>
To make em smile, now rake it into piles<br/>
And go buy ya self some style, prom night/cat walk<br/>
Prepare the suit for weeks, or effortless as a Parisian<br/>
Walking down the street, I ain't in it<br/>
I just walking round some beats<br/>
Tongue in cheek, just talking round some teeth<br/>
Neighborhood watching<br/>
Made of good options, mastermind times<br/>
Neighborhood hoodie take the hood shopping<br/>
Back track to stolen plates<br/>
Whats a closed wallet to an open safe<br/>
Peace of Paper/Cup of Jayzus what we writing?<br/>
These ain't entendres these is secret indictments<br/>
Little secret excitements<br/>
For willing minds I'm feeling fine<br/>
Balling hard and killing rhymes<br/>
Knocking off bigs and stealing shines<br/>
Aw shawty/Sade is it crime?<br/>
To DMV everytime until I give em license<br/>
They waiting on lines<br/>
Peace of Paper I'm Kerry James<br/>
Commissions fly as the Constitution as a plane<br/>
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what we doing?<br/>
Pizza Lasers or Cup of Razors<br/>
What u choosing?<br/>
Choosy mothers choose the smoothest peanut butters<br/>
And more cognizant fathers do George Washington Carver<br/>
A break from the paper it means do u identify more<br/>
With what's being made or the maker?<br/>
I'm what's being chased<br/>
I'm not the chaser<br/>
Cup of JAYZUS Peace of Paper<br/>
<br/>
Paper, paper make a plane &amp; paper make it rain<br/>
But how fly is a paper plane in the rain?<br/>
I'm fly paper on the brain<br/>
This and 2 ply paper just ain't the same<br/>
I do do it for the bottom<br/>
In the air is where I stop em<br/>
Threw words like 2 birds, that's Batman and Robin<br/>
To answer all your hunches that's just how I throw my punches<br/>
We must somehow become a family that's why I throw em in bunches<br/>
Mushroom clouds or on the flo' with the fungus<br/>
If you look em up and down<br/>
From the foot to where he put his crown<br/>
The slow Pan to understand is Shaq on the shoulders of Yao<br/>
Over and over for miles,<br/>
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS made a movie<br/>
Thank God on Friday, then buy a ruby on Tuesday<br/>
A couple beats from Jay, a couple beats from Ye<br/>
&amp; make Food for thought, that's a restaurant in a day!<br/>
It would behoove thee<br/>
The critics say that I fell off I acknowledge I slipped<br/>
But what do you call falling from space into a bottomless pit?<br/>
And not pit like Lui Kang can knock Baraka off with a hit<br/>
Knock it off for a bit<br/>
What would be really funny if I blew up after Drizzy<br/>
And started from the bottomless back to the topless like a watcher of Strips<br/>
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS,<br/>
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS, bout it, bout it<br/>
Don't let ya inner fears result in a outer coward<br/>
From baby showers to 80 flowers upon my coffin roof<br/>
The upper class glass is not filled up with the coughing proof<br/>
Be more P and step ya Yessirs Up<br/>
P-O-P! Jayzus a cup of Courage, I can't can't<br/>
Thats double negative it's 2 earls<br/>
They really nice but they'll never touch the cup its like I gave it two girls<br/>
This my odd future out in front Supreme shop<br/>
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop<br/>
Thought Kick Push was about drugs<br/>
Its not but just to be super sure<br/>
But from your perspective it might seem<br/>
Like Supreme out in front of Odd Future Store<br/>
So that skaters and skiers<br/>
Nose grinders and grinding up<br/>
Nose powders with ether<br/>
Not an Earl diss either but he might think it be and be like<br/>
"Lu's new should be Mr.Pure 2positive Shakur and 2 be sure he's<br/>
Not that really nice, That 2 girls and cup line sucked it really means<br/>
He gave himself a cup twice"<br/>
You just witnessed a double, a probable Odd Future diss in the future<br/>
And me ghostwritting my own rebuttals<br/>
You can't do that with a single cup<br/>
You gone need a couple, again you got a double<br/>
Got my shot on the rocks, but don't stop, keep pouring til it's a puddle<br/>
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what's the drive?<br/>
Greatest Rapper Alive or Greatest That Died?<br/>
Then on judgement day they say the greatest rapper revived<br/>
Oh look who's here the greatest rappers' arrived!!<br/>
At the birthday party the greatest rapper surprised!!!<br/>
Bumped into Doom the greatest rappers collide<br/>
Everybody dead but AZ the greatest rapper survived<br/>
I'm not the greatest rapper... the greatest rappers' a lie,<br/>
Got the same points as Lux the greatest rappers a tie<br/>
Told Jean, Foxy, &amp; Rah the greatest rappers' a girl<br/>
They said the greatest rappers' a guy<br/>
Phone rang it was Ghost he said "Kiss the greatest rapper... Goodbye!"<br/>
Chris said Common, Common said Kweli, Talib said I'm sure it's Mos Definitely!!<br/>
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS<br/>
Smack might have the greatest but now I'm just playing favorites<br/>
Playing flavored to be reminiscent of Miles on smack playing faded<br/>
PEACE OF.... these niggas is nice knees like these niggas aight<br/>
Shins like listen to them, ankles like shins making sense<br/>
Feet like why you running behind these niggas<br/>
They still trying to step inside ya prints<br/>
Bear trap rap don't step inside the clinch<br/>
Where da at? Don't jeopardize a better stride for limps<br/>
I exercise at length so electrify the fence<br/>
Let me inside the danger room on level 5 with weaponized defense<br/>
With an extra side of the next guys petty exercise attempts<br/>
The ghost of my career, better than most of what they revere<br/>
I take my targets and throw them back on my spear<br/>
I'm outta here
