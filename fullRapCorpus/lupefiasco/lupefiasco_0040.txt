Daydream<br/>
I fell asleep beneath the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
On a beautiful day<br/>
Daydream<br/>
I dream of you amid the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
Such a beautiful day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes<br/>
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries<br/>
Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies<br/>
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive<br/>
Room enough for one I tell my homies they can't ride<br/>
Unless they sittin on the shoulders but that's way too high<br/>
Let's try not to step on the children<br/>
The news cameras filmin<br/>
This walkin project buildin<br/>
Now there's hoes sellin hoes like right around the toes<br/>
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg<br/>
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees<br/>
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs<br/>
And there's a car chase goin on at the waist<br/>
Keep a vest on my chest<br/>
I'm sittin in my room as I'm lookin out the face<br/>
Somethin to write about<br/>
I still got some damage from fightin the whitehouse, just a<br/>
<br/>
Daydream<br/>
I fell asleep beneath the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
On a beautiful day<br/>
Daydream<br/>
I dream of you amid the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
Such a beautiful day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Now come on everybody, let's make cocaine cool<br/>
We need a few more half naked women up in the pool<br/>
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels<br/>
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?<br/>
And where's the champagne? We need champagne<br/>
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand<br/>
And now hold up your chain slow motion through the flames<br/>
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain<br/>
But not too loud 'cause the baby's sleepin<br/>
I wonder if it knows what the world is keepin<br/>
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreamin<br/>
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round creepin<br/>
I had to turn my back on what got you paid<br/>
I couldn't see half the hood on me like Abu Ghraib<br/>
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy<br/>
And all the televisions out there that raised me, I was<br/>
<br/>
Daydream<br/>
I fell asleep beneath the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
On a beautiful day<br/>
Daydream<br/>
I dream of you amid the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
Such a beautiful day<br/>
<br/>
Daydream<br/>
I fell asleep beneath the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
On a beautiful day<br/>
Daydream<br/>
I dream of you amid the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
Such a beautiful day
