<i>[Charles:]</i><br/>
Hey my name is Charles Porter, and I had stage 4 hotchkins lymphoma. I went through a year of strenuous chemo, then I had a bone marrow transplant where they gave me salvage chemo, and 5 days twice a day, full body radiation to basically bring my immune system down to nothing. I literally died to stay alive umm... come April I'll be in my 3rd year remission and it was a team effort. All the friends and family I had came together<br/>
And uhh... I had to keep that mental strong, but umm... We got through it uhh... some fallen soldiers went as I fought uhh... but they'll always be heroes. Peace!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out<br/>
And my back was up against the wall<br/>
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting<br/>
Could have died but I came out fighting<br/>
Could have died but I came out fighting<br/>
Could have died but I came out fighting (yeah)<br/>
Could have died but I came out fighting (uhh)<br/>
<br/>
With a breast full of lungs she ain't no pun<br/>
She gonna ride on it like a chopper in a trunk<br/>
Pink ribbon women she gonna live forever<br/>
Even though the doctor say she only get a month<br/>
Said it's my life and you only get it once<br/>
Once these flowers smell too damn good to be living in the funk<br/>
So I finna get it in and I finna get a crunk and I finna get the living (a-a-ah)<br/>
On remission from the jump<br/>
Breast cancer can't hold me back<br/>
That's the answer when they told me that<br/>
It can knock me down but I'm gonna be back<br/>
Strong, down for whatever exceptional and I don't know how to quit<br/>
And I never said never you can have that hair cause real talk bitch<br/>
I think I look better let's do it (do it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Fighter, with everything inside ya<br/>
Reportin' live from Death Row<br/>
Drop the charges see the lifer<br/>
Cell phones and your lighters<br/>
Need you to put them up higher<br/>
So when the candles on her birthday cake<br/>
Might set the thing on fire, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, seven years old with stage four<br/>
This what champions were made for<br/>
Only so much fun raises (pain for)<br/>
So I guess the rest is all on me<br/>
That will to live against what's out here<br/>
Killin kids' well kiss my ass it ain't killin' me<br/>
Got things to paint<br/>
Got places to go<br/>
Got things to see<br/>
Wanna see my moma grow up<br/>
Hold up, hold up<br/>
Wanna see my daddy grow up<br/>
Hold up, Hold up<br/>
I'm bald headed and brave hearted, I'm small<br/>
But I'm a hundred feet tall, try to stop me<br/>
Biopsy after biopsy<br/>
Chemo, but I'm a king though<br/>
I shake everything off me<br/>
Lymphoma can't hold me back<br/>
It can knock me down but I'm gonna be back<br/>
Throw some SpongeBob in my hot wheels track<br/>
I'm a made man, made wishes<br/>
I ain't scared, I ain't flinching<br/>
Sorry momma but I gotta say it<br/>
But where I'm from they don't make bitches<br/>
Let's do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Went undiagnosed and untreated<br/>
When they finally found it told em<br/>
It too far along and he couldn't beat it<br/>
But he couldn't see it<br/>
Miss me with that dead talk<br/>
Miss me my legs walk<br/>
My heart beats and my wife witness<br/>
So fuck cancer my life with me<br/>
And if I died it'd die with me let's do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
Might set that thing on fire, yeah<br/>
Yeah we might set that thing on fire, yeah<br/>
Yeah we might set that thing on fire<br/>
Set that thing on fire, set that thing on fire, yeah<br/>
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out<br/>
And my back was up against the wall<br/>
I could have died but I came out fighting<br/>
Could have died but I came out fighting
