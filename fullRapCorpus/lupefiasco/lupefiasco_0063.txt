<i>[The Game: Laughing, smoking]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lemme put you on game <i>[gunshot]</i><br/>
Lemme put you on game<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know that I run this place,<br/>
And I've begun this race,<br/>
Must I rerun this pace?<br/>
I'm the reason its become this way<br/>
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
They love my darkness,<br/>
I make them heartless,<br/>
And in return, the have become my martyrs,<br/>
I've been in the poem of many a poet,<br/>
And I reside in the art of many a artist<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
Some of your smartest have tried to artictulate<br/>
My whole part in this<br/>
But they're fruitless in their harvestin'<br/>
The drow grows from my footsteps<br/>
I'm the one that they follow,<br/>
I am the one that they march with<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
Through the back alleys<br/>
And the black markets,<br/>
The Oval Offices,<br/>
Crackhouses and apartments<br/>
Through the mazes of the queens,<br/>
The pages of the sages<br/>
And the Chambers of The Kings<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
Through the veins-es of the fiends,<br/>
A paper chaser's pager,<br/>
Yo, I'm famous on the scene<br/>
One of the oldest, most ancient-est of things<br/>
Seak every single language on the planet, y'all mean?<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
I am the American dream,<br/>
The rape of Africa<br/>
The undying machine,<br/>
The overpriced medicine,<br/>
The murderous regime,<br/>
The tough guy's front,<br/>
And the one behind the scenes<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
I am the blood of this city,<br/>
It's gas, water, and electricity,<br/>
I'm it's gym, and it's math, and it's history,<br/>
The gunshots in the class<br/>
And you can't pass if you're missin, G.<br/>
I taught them better than that<br/>
I taught them aim for the head<br/>
And hope they never come back<br/>
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby,<br/>
Hope he never comes back,<br/>
I hope he's with your mother,<br/>
With my hustlers high in my trap<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
I hope you die in his trash,<br/>
I can't help it all I hear when you're crying is laughs<br/>
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag,<br/>
Behind the hospital little baby,<br/>
Crack addicts had<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper,<br/>
A welfare-receiving prostitute<br/>
And gold digger,<br/>
You can watch on TV,<br/>
How they should properly depict you,<br/>
The rivers should flow with liqour,<br/>
Quench your thirst on my elixers,<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor<br/>
Ihe trusted misleader,<br/>
The number one defender,<br/>
And from a throne of their bones I rule,<br/>
These fools are my fuel<br/>
So I make them Cool<br/>
(lemme put you on game)<br/>
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool,<br/>
And feed 'em from the table that held Corleone's food,<br/>
If you die, tell them that you played my game<br/>
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name,<br/>
'Cause I'm the... <i>[gunshot]</i>
