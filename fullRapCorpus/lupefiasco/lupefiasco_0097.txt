She said love is a hard thing<br/>
Somewhere between golfing and gardening<br/>
Or parole board pardoning<br/>
But she was still down for a hard swing<br/>
Flowers she would pick like guitar strings<br/>
For a real good whiff<br/>
Of how life behind par seems<br/>
Until then she a bar-teend<br/>
And poor hot lead shots out of carbines<br/>
If an inmate ever even think about departing<br/>
Before it's time for the theft of a hard thing<br/>
Wanna see why a bum had hard dreams<br/>
Before he get gunned down, cause some sharp scene<br/>
Saw it all on the way to the art scene<br/>
Around the time they kicked us out, they had a park cleaned<br/>
She ain't living in a car she just RV-ing<br/>
Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team<br/>
Hard times, tryna duck em like Darkwing<br/>
Known for burning clothes and petty car-keying<br/>
And other less harmful skylarking<br/>
Bought a bag out of American Rag<br/>
A small Chinese-made American flag<br/>
Took a dollar bill then split it in half<br/>
The picture that she bought wouldn't fit in the cab<br/>
On a train trying her best not to live in the past<br/>
A bum probably asked could he spit in her ass<br/>
And that was it, fits, tantrums random<br/>
Helter-Skelter, a world gone Manson<br/>
<br/>
And I'll spare you the details<br/>
Dinner is ceviche out of seashells<br/>
Annoyed cause her date really can't speak well<br/>
But she forced to press on like Lee nails<br/>
Next table was abhored by the weed smell<br/>
She was done at the moment that the tea fell<br/>
A thick wool jacket on a cool night<br/>
Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight<br/>
Doesn't satisfy like a game of pool might<br/>
Thinking "what if Fantasia had a broom strike?"<br/>
Tune right out of that school life<br/>
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic<br/>
So what do you do like?<br/>
She said "absurd last words from a dude off a Zoosk site"<br/>
And then left him<br/>
Like the Roots left Geffen<br/>
And the state Howlin' Wolf left Chess in<br/>
Stop to watch flows have an unpaid session on the steps of a Westin<br/>
She really need to check in<br/>
And to apologize to her best friend<br/>
New bras to put her chest in<br/>
Love life or deathin...
