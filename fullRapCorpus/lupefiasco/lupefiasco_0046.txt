Look at what we did, came a long way from Dirty Ghetto Kids (Uh, yeah)<br/>
Look at what we did, came a long way from Dirty Ghetto Kids (Yeah)<br/>
You know what it is (Haha, uh, uh, come on)<br/>
When the cops didn't find him for grindin' though<br/>
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go<br/>
Plus, he had to at home a long time ago<br/>
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote<br/>
It read: "A little hungry, and need a little money, it's for my little sister, and her little tummy."<br/>
Wasn't lyin' though didn't go buy hydro<br/>
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros<br/>
'Cause he knew they wasn't cooking where he lived<br/>
Da-kook-akook-akook's now took him to the crib<br/>
A little hurt from the rail he took into the ribs<br/>
Right bast the pushers who couldn't underdig<br/>
"What's the use of pushin' if you ain't pushin' none of this"<br/>
If i kick with y'all I'm just pushin' for a bit<br/>
But, what was on his mind had pushed him to the lid<br/>
They best customer wasn't cooking for a kid<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
<br/>
So he kick, push<br/>
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look<br/>
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness<br/>
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)<br/>
And so he kick, push<br/>
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look<br/>
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness<br/>
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
You see his mom was a crackhead and his father couldn't be contacted<br/>
He lived with being different, was combated<br/>
Amongst the other things on his young, black head<br/>
And see, his girl was a white girl<br/>
But, just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light-world<br/>
She, too had the drama thick<br/>
Had a daddy and a momma, but her daddy used to momma hit<br/>
Daddy caught something, chasing fatties made her momma sick<br/>
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped it to the pharmacist<br/>
As suicidal feelings would rise, switch over to transitions, helped her conquer it<br/>
Pays for her momma's pills with a sponsership<br/>
A cell phone bill and a Honda kit Uh-huh<br/>
And that's why she skates with him<br/>
Someone to feel her pain and her place to be<br/>
<br/>
That's why, that's why, that's why she kick, push<br/>
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look<br/>
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness<br/>
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)<br/>
That's why she kick, push<br/>
Over his shoulders she swore she'd never look<br/>
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness<br/>
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
A traveling band of misfits and outcasts<br/>
Knock their heads from Misfits to Outkast<br/>
A lot of scars, they did this without pads<br/>
A lot of hearts, who did this without dads<br/>
One's father was fithy rich, two was middle class, and one was homeless<br/>
Add in a paralyzed girl in a wheelchair who just liked to watch it, that was the whole clique<br/>
I think about it everytime I see this old flick<br/>
That was taken in the park, in front of this old bench<br/>
They wrote on the back, "You thank for push, kick, hope you make a video, the beat is so sick."<br/>
Well, I did, I hope you seen it It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius<br/>
Love from Tony Hawk, beat from the Ice Creamer's<br/>
Before we out it out had to pay the fillipinas<br/>
Just to show 'em how...<br/>
<br/>
You kick, push<br/>
Over your shoulders you swore you'd never look<br/>
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness<br/>
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)<br/>
That's why you kick, push<br/>
Over your shoulders you swore you'd never look<br/>
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness<br/>
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)
