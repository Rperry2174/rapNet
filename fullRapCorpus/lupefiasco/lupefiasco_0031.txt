<i>[To the beat of Gorillaz' "Last Living Souls"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
So I think you had enough<br/>
What up Chuck? FNF up<br/>
RKF Tucks, adjust my cuffs<br/>
John Lennon Chucks, Independent Trucks<br/>
Yup, a little bit of dust<br/>
Brush my shoulder<br/>
Plus, a little bit of church<br/>
Uh, I showed you<br/>
Just a little bit of what can happen<br/>
If you open your eyes and imagine<br/>
Expand your horizons with rhyming and rapping<br/>
Quit rapping and rhyming bout coke and supplying<br/>
And clapping is anyone out there or are y'all all absent?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gorillaz:]</i><br/>
Are we the last living souls?<br/>
Are we the last living souls?<br/>
Are we the last to get away<br/>
To some another day?<br/>
Or do we know why we love?<br/>
Doesn't seem to be conveyed that way<br/>
Are we the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Fahrenheit 1/15 part III<br/>
One time to the FNF army<br/>
After party in the (Angel Nights) RV<br/>
Don't forget your cell phones and car keys<br/>
Don't forgot to tip the valet where you park please<br/>
I wish you well<br/>
Good night, drive safe, (A Rhyming Ape) t-shirts on sale
