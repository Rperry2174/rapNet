Where my ladies at?<br/>
I said where my ladies at?<br/>
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at<br/>
And for you baby I'll be your maniac<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing<br/>
Cuz everytime I see you baby you'll be rolling with me<br/>
Oh i'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime<br/>
Holding up my sign and it say <br/>
<br/>
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) <i>[x16]</i><br/>
<br/>
There my lady at<br/>
I said there my lady at<br/>
That's my honey if I give her money she ain't gotta pay me back<br/>
No you ain't gotta pay me back<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
And I'll forever give you my love cuz<br/>
When I'm down you always put a smile on me<br/>
And when all of my strength's up, and I'm 'bout to give up<br/>
And I need a lift up, I hear her say<br/>
<br/>
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) <i>[x16]</i><br/>
<br/>
She loves me, she loves me more<br/>
Amour me, she assures<br/>
She adores me<br/>
Even when it's up and down like see-saw<br/>
Surely, we can start from scratch like default<br/>
When they say you're not my baby like Maury<br/>
You can tell 'em that they're telling a story<br/>
Testify like you're telling a jury<br/>
And I'll repeat like you said it before me<br/>
We undefeated like a veteran army<br/>
And we as heavy as an elephant, aren't we?<br/>
Let's take 'em to the zoo, or better yet a safari<br/>
They want me to leave my Dame like the fella from Marcy (No!)<br/>
But we go way back like a set of Atari's<br/>
From baby fat 'til we skeletons darling<br/>
"Me" starring "You" is what it says on the marquee<br/>
So let's go give them a show, on my heart, get set, go!<br/>
<br/>
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) <i>[x16]</i><br/>
<br/>
And you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker<br/>
extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese<br/>
You best believe<br/>
That you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker<br/>
extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese<br/>
Yes indeed!<br/>
<br/>
Where my ladies at?<br/>
I said where my ladies at?<br/>
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at<br/>
And for you baby I'll be your maniac<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing<br/>
Cuz everytime I see you baby you'll be rolling with me<br/>
Oh i'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime<br/>
Holding up my sign and it say <br/>
<br/>
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) <i>[x16]</i>
