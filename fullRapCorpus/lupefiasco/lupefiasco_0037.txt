<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Uh.. yeah<br/>
He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes<br/>
Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it<br/>
He mimics and he mocks it<br/>
Really hates the box but he can't remember how to stop, it<br/>
Uh, so he continues to watch it<br/>
Hoping that it'll give him something that he can box with<br/>
Or how the locksmith, see the box as, locked in the box<br/>
Ain't got the combination to unlock, it<br/>
That's why he watch-es, scared to look away<br/>
Cause at that moment, it might show him<br/>
What to take off the locks with<br/>
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it<br/>
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it<br/>
As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils<br/>
The same ones that took away his voice<br/>
And just left this instrumental, like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jonah Matranga + (Lupe)]</i><br/>
And he never lies (he never lies, he never lies, uh)<br/>
And he never lies (uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)<br/>
And he never lies (he never lies)<br/>
Cause he never said anything at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes<br/>
Everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it<br/>
Anything not coming out the box he blocks it<br/>
See he loves to box and hope they never stop it<br/>
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it<br/>
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it<br/>
He protects the box, locks it in a box<br/>
when he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps<br/>
Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away<br/>
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen<br/>
And that's the last of the boxes<br/>
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it<br/>
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it<br/>
As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils<br/>
The same ones that took away his voice<br/>
And just left this instrumental, like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
(Anything at all..) He never lies<br/>
Uh, and you can't tell me just who you are<br/>
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars<br/>
You built that roof just to hide those stars<br/>
Now you can't take it back to the start<br/>
And you can't tell me just who you are<br/>
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars<br/>
You built that roof just to hide those stars<br/>
Now you can't take it back to the start<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
(Anything at all.. anything at all..)<br/>
Uh, and you can't tell me just who you are<br/>
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars<br/>
You built that roof just to hide those stars<br/>
Now you can't take it back to the start<br/>
And you can't tell me just who you are<br/>
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars<br/>
You built that roof just to hide those stars<br/>
Now you can't take it back to the start<br/>
