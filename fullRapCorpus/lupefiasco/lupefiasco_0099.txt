<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Let's go, hah<br/>
It's some fresh new Vans on my fresh new plans<br/>
Obama lied to you you nigga know you can't, ha<br/>
Change these nuts, shout to Fox news tryin' ta change me up<br/>
Saw Uncle Rush but I still don't vote<br/>
Cause niggas on the ballot and there's still no hope<br/>
So I'm back in the hood, Englewood to Inglewood<br/>
Doin' work that politician should, good<br/>
Blocks do they best tryin' to break my heart<br/>
Just tryin' to make you smart when I make my art<br/>
Occupy forever, more tents to the park<br/>
Howard Zinn gettin' spins in the Benz<br/>
If it's NPR, Diane Rehms<br/>
Kai Ryssdal, any good man<br/>
Sorry Bill O'Reilly but I'm so involved<br/>
Can you ask Limbaugh to return my calls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, Atlantic on the fritz<br/>
Cause I might not step foot back in that bitch<br/>
It disgusts me like Jerry Sandusky<br/>
Goodness gracious pedophiles and rapists, in high places<br/>
Not to mention slavery and slave ships<br/>
Come on Lu, gon' and keep it out the past<br/>
Tell Jerry's cellmate try and keep it out his ass<br/>
What happened to the class? All the low blows<br/>
I guess that most of the kids are black from the choke holds<br/>
As long as y'all win you can still put it in<br/>
Yup, hip hop back with a vengeance<br/>
Spirit of Chuck D with a whole lot of entrance<br/>
Just inches from the interest<br/>
Not to knock nice, but to knock it off the hinges, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break:]</i><br/>
I'm just playin', I'm just playin'<br/>
You know I like y'all<br/>
Well, some of y'all<br/>
But you know who I'm talking to, I rock with y'all<br/>
You know we do it big<br/>
Atlantic records First and Fifteenth all day<br/>
Yeah, let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Soundclash in Vegas, only dropping those new Kaskade hits<br/>
Let's see how crazy the rave gets<br/>
Might play my 2Pac favorites<br/>
Me and Sky back in the Labs<br/>
Q came through with beats by the back<br/>
Shout to Bassnec, count all that cash<br/>
Whatever you do, don't drop that flag<br/>
Watch is stll gold, chain is still gold<br/>
Feelin' brand new, Ferrari still old<br/>
Got the dreads cause Marley still cold<br/>
GTR my car be real slow<br/>
Nah my car be real close<br/>
To the speed of the light when I be on roads<br/>
Flow like I be on roids and I be on ten when I be on tour
