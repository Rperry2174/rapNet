<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Read my lips, clarinet, talk that walk, pair of steps<br/>
Two shots, parachutes, two drops, pair of troops<br/>
New drops, wearin' roofs, full bloom, bearin' fruits<br/>
Full moon put the where in wolvesâ€™, apparently put it in the air and shoot<br/>
Heirlooms that's what I leave, heirlooms that's how I weave<br/>
They don't care to you and that's hair to you, this what I breathe<br/>
I'm the heir apparent from a pair of parents<br/>
Taught me that sharin's carin' so I spread the bread out<br/>
That's what I need<br/>
To get in heaven that's when I bleed, get in hell when I breathe...<br/>
Get it? Inhale, when I breathe<br/>
Maybe you'll get it when I breathe, there's levels to this shit<br/>
And there's devils on the level of this bitch<br/>
We all ball even the devil gotta pitch<br/>
You fly so that's red bull and a fish<br/>
You can have that, that's complimentary<br/>
True story, documentary<br/>
Ninja Turtle, sewer side<br/>
Though continentally West Side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm just riding around town crown of thorns on my head<br/>
Living till I'm dead, yeah<br/>
Show your respect <i>[x5]</i><br/>
(Bow down to the nigga with the horns on his head)<br/>
(Everything red)<br/>
Show no respect <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
I'm King James with a blunt lit, my name ring like a phone call<br/>
It's only right that you meet defeat, I guess that's protocol<br/>
Soulo ho, oh God, Lord knows like you never said yes<br/>
Success, I'm on the verge-in, like I never had sex<br/>
You upset as fake breasts, but don't stress, it looks good on you<br/>
He couldn't get it understood, so I stood on him<br/>
Food and liquor, in my belly, of the beast but you knew already<br/>
I used to complain until planes I flew already<br/>
Now I'm ready, amen, like one guy I'm so heavy<br/>
Let's say tons, that's blasphemy, with eight guns, keep your machete<br/>
Young mind, fuck the world, that's an orgy with an OG<br/>
Ironically, when you're high as me you, won't need floor seats<br/>
This flow here for King Rich I won't stop 'till my team's richer<br/>
Mind, body and spirit on top of the dollar, spinnin'<br/>
My optimism is why I'm in this position<br/>
You pray, I prey, it's just that I'm a lion bitin' his victim<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm just riding around town crown of thorns on my head<br/>
Living till I'm dead, yeah<br/>
Show your respect <i>[x5]</i><br/>
(Bow down to the nigga with the horns on his head)<br/>
(Everything red)<br/>
Show no respect <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul/Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Pay homage, I ain't gotta plan it to play with comets<br/>
Save your comments, trigger finger make you vomit<br/>
Egghead just makin' omelets to move the chickens like Reaganomics<br/>
This world so damn ugly I won't put make-up on it, just bein' honest<br/>
Keys on us like dope dealers, open doors for the lost souls<br/>
Ring on keys like Swizz Beatz, to make sure a nigga never lost those<br/>
Amateurs get locked out, we janitors with the mops out<br/>
Clean house, I used to wanna be the GOAT but I'm the Ox now<br/>
Rap like I went to Oxford with bastards, threw Glocks on 'em<br/>
Red and blue, now the cops on 'em, ayy nigga<br/>
Hell yeah, you, with them dots on him, infraredin' you<br/>
Intellectual like Inspectah Deck, protect your neck from Lu<br/>
Cause we the children of the night!<br/>
Of the livin' dead lookin' for some light<br/>
I got some lean up in my Sprite<br/>
I call it the Jesus Juice, Lu, what would Jesus do? Whoo!<br/>
<br/>
