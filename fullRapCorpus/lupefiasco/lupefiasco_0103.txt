<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag<br/>
Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past<br/>
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math<br/>
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads<br/>
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs<br/>
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad<br/>
The system is a slab<br/>
Corruption is the swinger sittin high ridin dirty, drag racin into danger<br/>
And it's so clean, pine trees smellin good<br/>
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood<br/>
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours<br/>
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor<br/>
And as it all falls down and tatters on the floor<br/>
I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore<br/>
Cause I don't know what really matters anymore<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Casey Benjamin]</i><br/>
Many things, strangest things you ever seen<br/>
Oh, look at how they swing, would you look at how they swing?<br/>
Embedded they go, no eyelids gone low<br/>
Or gone by sundown, they're dodging 5-0<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Now as I wander through the city goin mad<br/>
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass<br/>
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag<br/>
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have<br/>
As long as they look good when they be doin bad<br/>
Then the separation from the truth is gettin vast, fast<br/>
Be a slave at first or free at last<br/>
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass<br/>
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff<br/>
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half<br/>
Divided over money<br/>
Delighted by the dummyin down of the importance of crowns we'll never have<br/>
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath<br/>
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath<br/>
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft<br/>
Of the witches in this business that be livin off your sad<br/>
Hatin on your happiness you hit 'em off with laughs<br/>
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad<br/>
Hello evil, I'm back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
