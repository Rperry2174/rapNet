<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I gave you honesty on my first joint and y'all all came out<br/>
I'll show you what change 'bout<br/>
Unroll your blunts, pour your champagne's out<br/>
Dullers of the pain, so you can plainly see the black man pain I campaign 'bout<br/>
God willing 'fore I wane, I take a champion route<br/>
Before I throw a bout<br/>
I'll walk out the game while my fans chanting my name out, Lupe, Lupe, Lupe...<br/>
Uh, and it's going to be PPV, won't be back for free<br/>
Gone need scratch to see me, rematch with me<br/>
My greatest enemy, is my inner me<br/>
So I take this urge and give you revenge of the nerd, Fahrenheit 1 15, uh<br/>
Yeah, uh, and you know I fight the feeling<br/>
Box so I can shop, sometime it doesn't register<br/>
So I return to the ring, like Return of the King<br/>
With the habit of a hobbit it makes it hard to drop it<br/>
I'm a klepto stealing<br/>
And it gets the best<br/>
Just when I guess that I left those leanings<br/>
I be back on post in a trench coat scheming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
So I get back into my stance, revert to my dance<br/>
With a shirt full of pants<br/>
And my accomplice got a purse full of pants<br/>
A pocket full of purses, with no intent to purchase in the plans<br/>
And we rehearsed it, till it's perfect, just to dodge the searchers of the man<br/>
Just to surface outside, then return of all the merch? (short for merchandise) to stay, in the service of the perfect understand<br/>
Um, uh, yeah, and I boost myself<br/>
So from the cold car to the caboose I'm felt<br/>
From the rear to the engineer<br/>
From the L to the Underground Railroad<br/>
From the redline to the TGV<br/>
A champion fighter for whom the bell tolls, LUP<br/>
Little engine from the hood, the hustler in me<br/>
Known to hit the track like John Henry<br/>
Just give me my glasses<br/>
My eight ounce everlastes<br/>
And I'm Michael Buffer in tree<br/>
(Uh, let's get ready, let me calm down man)<br/>
Shoplifter, tag switcher<br/>
That's me, nigga I'm back with cha<br/>
Revenge, Lupe, uh, championship is here<br/>
FNF up is here, 1st and 15 is here<br/>
Madison Street we back in here, Chi-Town is here<br/>
Lupe Fiasco<br/>
Fahrenheit 1 15, Revenge on The Nerds
