<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Bone<br/>
Come play with it baby<br/>
Uh<br/>
You know what I'm saying?<br/>
Yeah you already know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1:]</i><br/>
She's feeling herself a little too much<br/>
Come play with it, you can stay in it<br/>
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?<br/>
You done worked your fingers to the bone<br/>
She's feeling herself a little too much<br/>
You stay in it, so play with it<br/>
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?<br/>
You done worked your fingers to the bone<br/>
Yeah, their bones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
You can talk to us, you can walk to us<br/>
But you still lost to us<br/>
Worth your worth wait in waiting<br/>
But that ain't how much you cost to us<br/>
You don't know, worth your weight in weight<br/>
Borderline fine, but you can't get back across to us<br/>
Your dime bags ain't freeway<br/>
And you're Ross to us, your cartel, you ain't barball<br/>
You a Barbie, you can't maintain that<br/>
That's why your bar fell<br/>
And your pussy whack<br/>
From letting all them niggas push it back<br/>
Nasty nostalgia from all the places you took it at<br/>
Flashbacks are where you looking at<br/>
Now what? You clear cut<br/>
Switching heels, and your hair up?<br/>
You know how many bills been inside your pudding pack?<br/>
You done clicked up with some lame<br/>
We got to see in a different frame<br/>
You the same picture to the same<br/>
Niggas that came all inside of your brains<br/>
Self approved but don't stunt<br/>
Switch it up but don't front<br/>
Just to return back to getting turned out<br/>
And fucking for what you want<br/>
Sucking for what you need<br/>
But you don't even really need that<br/>
You just suck for love<br/>
But you don't even really believe that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
You feeling yourself a little too much<br/>
Stayed up all inside you, self<br/>
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?<br/>
You done worked your fingers to the bone<br/>
Their bones<br/>
She's feeling herself a little too much<br/>
She played with it, but she can't stay in it<br/>
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?<br/>
You done worked your fingers to the bone<br/>
Yeah, their bones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You gonna break your back tryna be like these televised hoes that you see on TV<br/>
Tryna keep up with a magazine cover, living unreal lives that they heard on CD's<br/>
Fake ass, fake face, fake titties, that's great shape<br/>
They don't make sense, let's make papes, that's real food but saying fake grace<br/>
But we don't care cause it tastes great, this bullshit on these great plates<br/>
But who am I to say what's what? But if God real then we fucked up<br/>
If God real then we fucked up, if God real then we fucked up<br/>
And I can only blame myself in BET uncut<br/>
So many shades of gray, in the new generation, they young sluts<br/>
Has it always been this way? Squirrels only happy when they nut bust<br/>
You can take a look at the animal kingdom if you don't agree<br/>
They be going hard just to get a mate, then get the pussy then leave<br/>
And lions be having like four hoes with no clothes, that's so cold<br/>
That justifies what's in a nigga mind, they do the same shit for the homos<br/>
<i>[?]</i> up girl be like, oh no J. Cole got her looking for a J. Cole<br/>
She gon pass up somebody way cool and end up on some pimp nigga pay roll<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3:]</i><br/>
She feeling herself a little too much<br/>
Stayed up all inside you, self<br/>
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?<br/>
You done worked your fingers to the bone<br/>
Their bones<br/>
She's feeling herself a little too much<br/>
She played with it, but she can't stay in it<br/>
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?<br/>
You done worked your fingers to the bone<br/>
Their bones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I'm sorry I'm just being emotional<br/>
I just wanted to get really close to you<br/>
But you was being so unsociable<br/>
Played this game, it's being so uncoachable<br/>
Or is it me and you're really approachable?<br/>
But I don't know cause I'm too intimidated<br/>
I overcompensated and started roasting you<br/>
From afar, and I don't even know who you are<br/>
Or maybe I do<br/>
But you ain't impressed by my car and that shit ain't cool<br/>
Luxury clothes equals fucking hoes, and those are the rules<br/>
But you breaking it, these frame change ring, watch, bracelet<br/>
This champagne, tasting it, we've been talking like five minutes<br/>
Ain't you already supposed to be naked bitch?<br/>
But you feeling yourself?<br/>
You feeling yourself?<br/>
You feeling yourself?<br/>
You feeling yourself?<br/>
You feeling yourself?
