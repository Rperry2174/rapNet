They thought it was cool to burn crosses in your front lawn as they hung you from trees in<br/>
Your backyard.<br/>
They thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and strand katrina.<br/>
He thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom and open fire, virginia tech columbine,<br/>
Stop the violence.<br/>
They thought it was cool to tare down the projects and put up million dollar condos,<br/>
Gentrification.<br/>
They think its cool to stand on the block hiding products in their socks making quick dime bag<br/>
Dollars.<br/>
They think its cool to to ride down on you in blue and white unmarked cars, bustin you upside<br/>
Yo head.<br/>
Freeze....cause the problem is we think its cool too.<br/>
Check your ingredients, before you overdose, on the cool.
