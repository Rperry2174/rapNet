"Yeah! Revenge! Now what we're gonna do right now,<br/>
is we gonna try a little experiment, you know what I'm saying?<br/>
A little science project. We're gonna call it..."<br/>
<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
You, you, you, yes, let the words rule you<br/>
till you woozy, let the lyrics subdue you,<br/>
Massage and soothe you, move you<br/>
Till consciousness lose you, Lu now rules you,<br/>
Do what Lu do, and you'll do beautiful<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
I'm the meanest, you the meanest?<br/>
I'm the meanest, and I mean this<br/>
Now I don't mean this to sound fiendish,<br/>
but I'm a genius, You a genius?<br/>
And the cleanest, never seen this<br/>
as clean as my cleanest<br/>
From on top, from underneath,<br/>
from behind, or in between us<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
I'm a hustler, creepin' with my hat low,<br/>
Niggas know I'm packed so, what they go do that fo'?<br/>
Niggas got my back, though, like answering the back door,<br/>
Catch you, I'ma slap you, leave you redder than the Bat Phone,<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
Put a little bit of this and a little bit of that (that)<br/>
Mix with a little bit of pimp and a little bit of mack,<br/>
And a little bit of limp, and a whole lotta gangsta lean,<br/>
I can't be seen, I ain't the king, but a nigga is strengthening,<br/>
To paint the scene, and take the thing over like a soldier<br/>
Colder than a polar, got the hood like a cobra, nigga thank the team<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, now remember that. That's--thats a part of the experiment, I had to set it up,<br/>
But don't worry, I know what you're thinking, I was thinking the same thing, Just, just follow<br/>
me, okay? Watch, okay? C'mon!"<br/>
<br/>
Murder niggas, step on my shoes, I'll hurt a nigga,<br/>
Kill a nigga, fill a nigga with holes,<br/>
Call women 'hoes,' hold up niggas, hold up hoes,<br/>
Break the calm, dead and they bomb, Blow up niggas blow up hoes, <br/>
Turn around, smack they mom<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
Heal niggas, educate and build niggas,<br/>
Instill in niggas it's real to respect women<br/>
Treat them like they real, they feel nigga,<br/>
Watch the birds, watch Dr. Phil nigga,<br/>
Chill nigga, go learn a skill nigga.<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
Rims, Mercedez Benz, 20s, 22s, 24s, <br/>
Rolls, gold, platinum watches, cases, and mo',<br/>
Gucci, rubies, mansions, models, VIP, Ferraris<br/>
chinchillas, diamond rings, chains,<br/>
Rangerovers, bling bling.<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
Nigga busses, trains, pockets full of change,<br/>
Dimes, quarters taking orders, delivering pizzas,<br/>
Air conditionless, beaters, hand-me-down sneakers, silver,<br/>
Wannabe models won't show me love, and I can't get in the club.<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
"Hah. You're doing good, right? Alright so check this out.<br/>
Now, go back to the first one, alright? Run back to that one.<br/>
We're gonna have a little more fun with that one. Alright? You ready? Alright. C'mon!"<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, it's coming back to you, Lu no longer rules you,<br/>
You can do what you do, back to your usual.<br/>
Switch!<br/>
It's official? It's official, I'm official<br/>
As officials got the stripes, and the flags, and the whistles,<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
Hustlin' watch my niggas come from the undergound,<br/>
Just like Thrilla play Bambi, you gonna hear that 'thumple' sound<br/>
Switch!<br/>
They can't touch the sound that I'm bustin' out<br/>
It's like a cloud trying to touch the ground,<br/>
Tough and bound ever since I've been touching down,<br/>
Jealous niggas catching feelings 'cause I'm hustlin' now<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
They be hatin'?<br/>
Switch!<br/>
They be hatin'! <br/>
Switch!<br/>
What what what, they be hatin<br/>
Don't give 'em say in this <br/>
Switch!<br/>
What's a nigga supposed to say when they up in my face?<br/>
That you got a cousin that don't mind catchin' cases<br/>
bustin' niggas heads and slappin' niggas faces?<br/>
Switch!<br/>
<br/>
And he'll do it. He'll do it? He'll do it<br/>
And I'll prove it, 'Cause I done seen it<br/>
You done seen it? I done seen it,<br/>
He the meanest, <br/>
Switch!<br/>
Ho, ho, wait a minute, <br/>
I thought you were the meanest<br/>
see, that's why this thing is finished right now.<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah. Experiment done. I think that was good, <br/>
I think that was a nice little science project."
