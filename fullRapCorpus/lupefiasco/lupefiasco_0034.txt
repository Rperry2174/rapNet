Affirmative no further furnishing is needed<br/>
I believe we are completed, dig<br/>
We all in agreement on the wall paper<br/>
happy with the color scheme welcome to the crib<br/>
A two family habitat for humanity with a view with in the insanity<br/>
Live<br/>
my vida loca was built like bob vila villa gone<br/>
He architected, I arted what I harbored Jimmy Carter from Chicago's west side<br/>
Finish my construction now we hold we coming like contracepts<br/>
I'm conciespet that kunta get from conversation held with the Satan on my shoulder<br/>
Which lead the steps that kept me looking over the shoulder like shofers were my angels at<br/>
Painful yet Mary I ain't Jerry Garcia ma here but I'm grateful church<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
We just might be OK<br/>
After all<br/>
Sun don't shine<br/>
On this day<br/>
<br/>
This feeling getting heavy is heaven<br/>
I am Atlas at this manage the balance<br/>
Massive mass pull my back with out tipping my glasses<br/>
This was not pitiful from passes of O G s<br/>
This is so me<br/>
Ask us many mention little homie, little bony<br/>
But the rhymes is fat<br/>
in fact<br/>
just like a Rochester customer<br/>
God bless the mothers and younger brother is a hustler<br/>
Cause she don't want sob at his wake<br/>
But he want to follow in the step<br/>
Bang his hat learn his shake<br/>
master his swagger in the bathroom<br/>
Mirror cop a Chevy steady mob in his place<br/>
Chea it's just the problem we face look his mom is in the face n promises his strait<br/>
<br/>
Then he leaves the house that love built that<br/>
Hug renovate that section 8 pays for<br/>
Well lets pray for em<br/>
Let the beat play for em<br/>
Put the trouble on display for em<br/>
Cause he gotta go face the drama<br/>
With a difference face from the one that he use to face his momma<br/>
If you look close<br/>
You'll see it consists of a smile that hurts a ice grill<br/>
in a trace of trauma<br/>
little bit of his father<br/>
another criterion that's no difference from a young Liberian<br/>
who let the delirium worry him living in it the city<br/>
out of his mind<br/>
liria reconsilia<br/>
I'm cool I don't for tell best<br/>
I ain't nicest MC, I ain't cornel west<br/>
I am cornel west side chi town Guevara<br/>
Malcolm eXorcise the demons<br/>
Gangster leaning<br/>
He traded in his kufi for a new era<br/>
chose a 44 over a mortar board<br/>
I ain't a credited institute graduate<br/>
I ain't from Nazareth<br/>
My conception wasn't immaculate<br/>
I ain't mastering no calculus<br/>
A good addition to the rap audience<br/>
I back flipped on the mattress they slept on me on<br/>
What down Joe, knowing is half the battle<br/>
fighting temptation, have an apple<br/>
Shakes the snakes, pimp the system<br/>
Let's get into it, tabernacle
