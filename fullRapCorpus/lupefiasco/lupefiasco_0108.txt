<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
It's a mad world out here, I tell you<br/>
The world's gone stark, raving mad<br/>
Everyone in the world is mad<br/>
It's a mad crazy world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I see diamond-flooded demons<br/>
Lamborghini angels<br/>
Lamborghini angels<br/>
Lamborghini angels<br/>
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through<br/>
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure<br/>
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword<br/>
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door<br/>
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord<br/>
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause<br/>
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores<br/>
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war<br/>
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward<br/>
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores<br/>
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours<br/>
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores<br/>
But we must still pray that his color will be cured<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain<br/>
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains<br/>
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged<br/>
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became<br/>
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims<br/>
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane<br/>
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain<br/>
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame<br/>
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name<br/>
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints<br/>
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane<br/>
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine<br/>
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind<br/>
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine<br/>
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time<br/>
With no life inside his body now he finally think he's safe<br/>
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face<br/>
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states<br/>
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped<br/>
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens<br/>
Doesn't mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins<br/>
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John F. Kennedy]</i><br/>
My fellow Americans...<br/>
