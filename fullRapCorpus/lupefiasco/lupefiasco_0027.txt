Once upon a time not long ago<br/>
An idea, yeah that's what I had<br/>
To take Demon Days<br/>
Use a little Pro Tools<br/>
With my MCing ways and make 'em mash<br/>
Just having fun not chasing cash<br/>
Apologize now for it make ya mad<br/>
Had to call G Wall tell him warm up the mic<br/>
Put the padding on the walls, gonna make some magic<br/>
Studio is nothing lavish<br/>
Matter of fact it's just an attic<br/>
Background noise from the family<br/>
Hearing the mic stand and the outside traffic<br/>
Still turned out fantastic<br/>
Turn my vocals up just a tad bit<br/>
Fresh from the first and fifteen<br/>
Quarantine touching you super cool that's it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS: Gorillaz]</i><br/>
<br/>
So sit on back and enjoy the show<br/>
Then lean on forward and enjoy some more<br/>
And then, sit back again<br/>
And keep on enjoying like you was enjoying before <br/>
Whether you enjoy the beats or enjoy the flow<br/>
As long as you enjoy then bring joy to Joe<br/>
And Joe is me but Woe is me if you and yours ain't enjoying the show<br/>
So, don't worry about the time it take<br/>
If you ain't got one better find a date<br/>
A beautiful inside or a diamond take<br/>
I was probably into you a rhyming ape<br/>
Ape ape<br/>
My rhymes are straight<br/>
If you ain't got one better find a date<br/>
A beautiful inside or a diamond take<br/>
I was probably into you a rhyming ape ape ape
