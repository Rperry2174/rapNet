<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
Alright, already the show goes on<br/>
all night, till the morning we dream so long<br/>
anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up<br/>
just remember when you come up<br/>
the show goes on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Have you ever had the feeling that you was being had<br/>
Don’t that shit that make you mad<br/>
They treat you like a slave, with chains all on your soul,<br/>
and put whips up on your back,<br/>
they be lying through they teeth<br/>
hope you slip up off your path<br/>
I don’t switch up I just laugh<br/>
put my kicks up on they desk<br/>
unaffected by they threats than get busy on they ass<br/>
see that’s how that Chi-Town made me<br/>
That’s how my daddy raised me<br/>
that glittering may not be gold, don’t let no body play me<br/>
if you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me<br/>
Go on and put your hands up, when times are hard you stand up<br/>
L-U-P the man, cause a brand that the fans trust<br/>
so even if they ban us they’ll never slow my plans up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
One in the air for the people that ain’t here<br/>
Two in the air for the father that’s there<br/>
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto<br/>
Four for the kids who don’t wanna be there<br/>
None for the niggas trying to hold them back<br/>
Five in the air for the teacher not scared to tell those kids thats living in the ghetto that the niggas holdin back that the World is theirs!<br/>
Yeah yeah, the World is yours, I was once that little boy<br/>
Terrified of the World<br/>
Now I’m on a World tour<br/>
I will give up everything, even start a world war<br/>
for these ghettos girls and boys im rapping round’ the World for!<br/>
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour, Oakland out to Auckland<br/>
Gaza Strip to Detroit, say hip-hop only destroy<br/>
tell em’ look at me, boy!<br/>
I hope your son don’t have a gun and never be a D-boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So no matter what you been through<br/>
no matter what you into<br/>
no matter what you see when you look outside your window<br/>
brown grass or green grass<br/>
picket fence or barbed wire<br/>
Never ever put them down<br/>
you just lift your arms higher<br/>
raise em till’ your arms tired<br/>
Let em’ know you’re there<br/>
That you struggling and survivin’ that you gonna persevere<br/>
Yeah, ain’t no body leavin, no body goin’ home<br/>
even if they turn the lights out the show is goin’ on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
