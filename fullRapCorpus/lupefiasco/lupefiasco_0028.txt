Picture I'm a dreamer<br/>
I'll take you deeper<br/>
Down to the sleepy glow<br/>
Time is a low<br/>
Don't you know?<br/>
What are we going to do?<br/>
What are we going to do?<br/>
<br/>
Is there something in the air? Do you feel it?<br/>
Is it close? Is it far? Is it here? Do you feel it?<br/>
Are you happy? You sad? You scared? Do you feel it?<br/>
Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it fair? Do you feel it?<br/>
Is it real? Is it fake? Do you care? Do you feel it?<br/>
When he stopped and he paid for head, did he feel it?<br/>
With his wife when he laid in the bed, did she feel it?<br/>
When the police kicked in the door, did he feel it?<br/>
When he had to go to war, did he feel it?<br/>
When they hung and they swung from a tree, did they feel it?<br/>
Well I know when they come for me, will I feel it<br/>
When he blew all his money to ball, did he feel it?<br/>
When that bullet came through a wall, did she feel it?<br/>
When he stopped and he dropped when he died, did he feel it?<br/>
When his momma closed his eyes, did he feel it?<br/>
When she couldn't take the pain, did she feel it?<br/>
When the dope flows through her veins, does she feel it?<br/>
When she took off all her clothes, did she feel it?<br/>
When she slid down that pole, did she feel it?<br/>
Will it all be clear to see, will I feel it?<br/>
If God forgives me, will I feel it?<br/>
<br/>
I ask my baby if she love me, she said she don't know<br/>
She said the game's got her heart, the streets have got her soul<br/>
I ask my baby if she love me, she said she don't know<br/>
She said the game's got her heart, the streets have got her soul<br/>
I said, "Wow"<br/>
<br/>
When his food come out the trash, does she feel it?<br/>
When he sleeps under the underpass, does he feel it?<br/>
When she's pregnant and smoking weed, does she feel it?<br/>
When the jury just won't believe, do they feel it?<br/>
When this song come on in the club, do you feel it?<br/>
When a racist shows you love, do you feel it?<br/>
When he know he won't win the game, do he feel it?<br/>
When a preacher is driven insane, do he feel it?<br/>
Every time I write a rhyme, do I feel it?<br/>
When I'm running out of time, will I feel it?<br/>
When the liquor is poured on the ground, do they feel it?<br/>
If my music didn't make a sound, would you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
I ask my baby if she love me, she said she don't know<br/>
She said the game's got her heart, the streets have got her soul<br/>
I ask my baby if she love me, she said she don't know<br/>
She said the game's got her heart, the streets have got her soul<br/>
I said, "Wow"<br/>
<br/>
I ask my baby if she love me, she said she don't know<br/>
She said the game's got her heart, the streets have got her soul
