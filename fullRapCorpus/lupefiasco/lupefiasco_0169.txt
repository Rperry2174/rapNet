Looks like we gonna be fighting in the streets<br/>
Its what its looking like to me (nah)<br/>
So you stay right there as we bow our heads and say our prayers<br/>
It's a lot of killers in this room mama<br/>
I hope I make it out pools mama<br/>
I'm gonna show em what to do mama<br/>
I'm gonna take 'em off to school mama<br/>
<br/>
He was talking that on stream<br/>
He was talking that online<br/>
You can say whatever you want<br/>
But you ain't talking that right now<br/>
Maybe you can tell yourself exactly how to take this game back<br/>
Save you from these combos, maybe help you out these frame traps<br/>
Moment 37 you to heaven with the Quickness<br/>
1-800-EX-TATSU call me if you whiff it<br/>
V-in-trigger, stands for Valle, now let's get to business<br/>
Evolution we just brought you up in here to witness<br/>
Fight Stick - like it cleaned, keep it wiped off<br/>
On the mic, but I fight, call me Mike Ross<br/>
It's about to go crazy turn the lights off<br/>
Done killing him and I'll come and be fighting y'all<br/>
<br/>
Looks like we gonna be fighting in the streets<br/>
Its what its looking like to me (nah)<br/>
So you stay right there as we bow our heads and say our prayers<br/>
It's a lot of killers in this room mama<br/>
I hope I make it out pools mama<br/>
I'm gonna show em what to do mama<br/>
I'm gonna take 'em off to school mama
