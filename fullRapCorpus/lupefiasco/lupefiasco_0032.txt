<i>[uncredited female rapper]</i><br/>
Food and liquor stores rest on every corner<br/>
From 45th and State to the last standing hymn nuhana<br/>
J&amp;J's, Harold's chicken, good finger licking<br/>
While they sin, gin, sin sin at Rothschild and Kenwood Liquors<br/>
The winos crooked stagger<br/>
meets the high stride of the youth searching for the truth<br/>
They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings<br/>
They get, high off that drum bass and 20/20 rims<br/>
They rock braids, Air Force Ones and Timbs<br/>
They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq and 40's<br/>
They call they women hoes, bust downs and shorties<br/>
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full<br/>
Prisons packed, bubbling over in brown sugar<br/>
They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered<br/>
The well is running dry, the days of Malcolm and Martin have ended<br/>
Our hope has descended and off to the side<br/>
Waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution<br/>
Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution<br/>
But God has another solution, that has evolved from the hood<br/>
I present one who turns, the Fiasco to good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
A'uzu billahi min ash shaitani r rajimi<br/>
Bismi 'llahi 'r-rahmani 'r-rahim<br/>
Dedicated, to my grandmother<br/>
Peace! And much love to you<br/>
YEAH!! And it start<br/>
1st and, 15, proudly present<br/>
You know what it is<br/>
See.. I got this philosophy right<br/>
I think the world, and everything in it<br/>
Is made up of a mix, of two things<br/>
You got your good, y'know, and you're bad<br/>
You got your food, and your liquor<br/>
That's right.. Chilly Chill!<br/>
You already know, it's a long time coming<br/>
I give you my.. I give you my heart<br/>
My soul, my mind my thoughts, my feelings<br/>
My experience, nothing more, and nothing less<br/>
Yes, FNF, uh-huh! So<br/>
With no further adieux...<br/>
Lupe, Fiasco's, "Food &amp; Liquor"
