<i>[Hook - Jennifer Hudson:]</i><br/>
If I had a dollar, for every time they counted me out<br/>
And my back was up against the wall<br/>
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting<br/>
I could have died but I came out fighting <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
With a breast full of lumps, man she ain't no punk<br/>
Said he gonna ride on it like a chopper in a trunk<br/>
Pink ribbon woman, she gone live forever<br/>
Even though the doctor said she only get a month<br/>
Said "It's my life, and you onle get in once"<br/>
These flowers smell too damn good to be living in the funk<br/>
So I finna get it in, and I finna get it crunk<br/>
And I finna get to living, ey-ey-ey-eyes on remission from the junk<br/>
Breast cancer can't hold me back<br/>
That's the answer when they told me that<br/>
It can knock me down, but I'm gon' be back, strong<br/>
Down for whatever, exceptional and I don't know how to quit<br/>
And I never said never, you can have that hair cause real talk bitch<br/>
I think I look better, let's do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Fighter, with everything inside her<br/>
Reporting live from Death Row, drop the charges see you life uh<br/>
Cellphones and your lighters, need you to put 'em up higher<br/>
So many candles on her birthday cake, might set the thing on fire<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Common:]</i><br/>
My daddy say he got it in his prostate<br/>
When I went to see him, he had lost weight<br/>
Trying to find the words in a lost state, of mind<br/>
Pictures on the wall that remind<br/>
Me of the times that we once had<br/>
Had to take my daughter to see granddad<br/>
Pop, pop, nothing's impossible, you never been logical<br/>
I know what doctor's do, I know what God can do<br/>
Abdominal pain, hard to explain<br/>
For you to get better, it starts in your brain<br/>
Life ain't a game, the fight it remains, dance in the rain<br/>
When it first came, I was like damn<br/>
Then I start thinkin', then I start praying<br/>
Spirits went up, count went down<br/>
You gon' live forever, how you living now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2 - Common:]</i><br/>
Fighter, definition of a rider<br/>
Got all that ishh about you, with what you got inside ya<br/>
Cellphones and your lighters, put them things up higher<br/>
Even when you tired, you keep me inspired<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Jennifer Hudson]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Went undiagnosed and untreated<br/>
When they finally found it, told me too far along and he couldn't beat it<br/>
But he couldn't see it, miss me with that dead talk<br/>
Miss me, my legs walk and my hearts beats and my wife witness<br/>
So fuck cancer, my life with me, and if I die, it die with me<br/>
<br/>
