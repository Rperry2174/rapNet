<i>[Hook - Nikki Jean:]</i><br/>
Haile Selassie<br/>
High as the eye of an osprey<br/>
I'm driving<br/>
Poseidon you tried to stop me, from diving<br/>
Lookin' for my<br/>
Lookin' for my<br/>
Lookin' for my<br/>
As I float<br/>
Brand new shell for my goals<br/>
Tattoos all on my coast<br/>
<br/>
Throughout history<br/>
It has been the inaction of those who could have acted<br/>
The indifference of those who should have known better<br/>
The silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most<br/>
This, has made it possible for evil to triumph<br/>
Selassie<br/>
<br/>
Man's limitation, transfiguration<br/>
I can dance done at the welcome to the demo<br/>
Modern man comes to the weddin' in the limo<br/>
Mixin' doves with the rice rain<br/>
Uncle Ben's off the rails on the night train<br/>
And that storm took us to the platform, pushas<br/>
Back to the bachelor's backdoor, unhook us<br/>
Hope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us<br/>
And that's very old like Blackberry Bold but the Juice<br/>
Sweeter than where the party at, or<br/>
Releasing these niggas from the roofs, and<br/>
Leavin' these niggas on the loose, or<br/>
Keepin' these niggas in the coupes, and<br/>
Leavin' these niggas on the noose,<br/>
Free!... Shamu fan, got a world to see!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Then until the philosophy which holds one race superior<br/>
And another inferior<br/>
Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned<br/>
That until there no longer<br/>
First class and second class citizens of any nation<br/>
That until the color of the man's skin<br/>
Is no more significant than the color of his eyes<br/>
Selassie<br/>
<br/>
To the limit<br/>
The limit in the Methadone clinic<br/>
Ridin' with the pack like a Pelitan<br/>
Flyin' with the sack in the trap like the pregnant<br/>
As it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon<br/>
If I triple my worth, will it cripple my mom?<br/>
If I simple my search, will it mental my calm?<br/>
Will it hurt if I give you my palm?<br/>
To tell in it and don't put a nail in it<br/>
How you gonna see the world if you wailin'<br/>
And readin' my palms like there's braille in it<br/>
Is it the trail or the forest?<br/>
Or the forest with the trail in it?<br/>
That's a sail with a 12 in it<br/>
Water coming through from impalin' it<br/>
Nothin' left of the boat but my holes<br/>
Still I fill up the world and I float, like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
A qualified man with vision<br/>
Unmoved by daily selfish interests<br/>
Led to right decisions by his conscience<br/>
In general, a man who knows from whence he comes<br/>
And where he's going<br/>
Will cooperate with his fellow human beings<br/>
He will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties<br/>
But will inspire others by his good example<br/>
You are being watched by the nation<br/>
And you should realize<br/>
That you, will satisfy it if you do good<br/>
But on the contrary, you do evil, it will lose it's hope and confidence in you<br/>
Selassie<br/>
<br/>
H-h-h-hydrant open wide<br/>
On the side of the colonized<br/>
Swimmin' in the street, fell asleep on my mama thighs<br/>
Blockin' out the noise that destroys lil' boys<br/>
Live enjoy, ships ahoy, get deployed by the rock-a-byes<br/>
D-d-d-deep into the sea of my dreams<br/>
Lyin' fall asleep at the feet of my queen<br/>
Hawk comin' right to the beat of your wings<br/>
Song for the Ethiopian King<br/>
Haile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
