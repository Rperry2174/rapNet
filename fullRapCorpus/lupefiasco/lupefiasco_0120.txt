<i>[Guy Sebastian:]</i><br/>
From the floating death, to the fire of death<br/>
To a flower outside my grave and oh man<br/>
Were you just being polite with your hands?<br/>
<br/>
Take time to learn me like court appointed attorneys<br/>
Restore the order, we either join or adjourning<br/>
Less you join I'm up performing the journey<br/>
In all earnest, I go so Bernie<br/>
Takes another nigga to turn me<br/>
Get it straight, I ain't late on states<br/>
I'm just sternly stating<br/>
How what I do, with grace takes another nigga to turn mean<br/>
My return means like blockbuster with a tick<br/>
And I ain't kind but I don't hit<br/>
So you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin<br/>
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win<br/>
Yeah, spoiler alert<br/>
I can hear you all saying "boy you're a jerk"<br/>
But it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo<br/>
Get in, then we win and do it all again, ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Guy Sebastian:]</i><br/>
From the floating death, to the fire of death<br/>
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man<br/>
Were you just being polite with your hands?<br/>
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan<br/>
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too<br/>
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too<br/>
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one<br/>
<br/>
Now me and words, we made a deal, that I'm gon' keep 'em real<br/>
And they show me their secrets, I can even cop a feel<br/>
Victorious, can't match wit, with warriors<br/>
I match wig with wits, similarly can't mix matchsticks with forests'<br/>
Only you can prevent what I do<br/>
Only due can prevent what's my view<br/>
I match matchsticks with wicks<br/>
Wicker man, take a sip of liquor and<br/>
Spit the lip off warriors<br/>
And spit flames, nigga get in the gang ahh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's road rage, without a roll cage<br/>
Takes courage to run on these roadways<br/>
I know you like "no way", but I'm a full race<br/>
All so every soccer Terry Fox moulding, go ahead<br/>
Don't stop, go ahead<br/>
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars<br/>
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down<br/>
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm him down<br/>
'Fore you know you watch your car with your briefcase walkin' round<br/>
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production<br/>
And Sebastian on the hook, like being dug by Michael Douglas<br/>
So don't start that walk through Echo Park<br/>
My life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam<br/>
Just show some love back to your number one fan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
