<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?<br/>
The motherfuckin' Skateboard P<br/>
Knowin' that you're me low, playin' games like Cee-lo<br/>
In them tight situations like Speedos<br/>
You can have it your way like Carlito<br/>
My niggas will be happy to give y'all torpedoes<br/>
And have your car twisted like a blunt<br/>
For you faggot-ass niggas that like to front<br/>
I'm on some BBC Bape shit, I'm on some cake shit<br/>
In the kitchen with the heat, makin' beats in my apron<br/>
You hate it, and you want to erase it<br/>
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it<br/>
My flow interrupts your homeostasis<br/>
I Rolls-Royce it on a regular basis<br/>
You talk street shit, it sound like sweet shit<br/>
Straight licorice, you niggas sound ticklish<br/>
80K large for the Hermes dream<br/>
Purple Croc in all your magazines<br/>
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine<br/>
Dion, me and my niggas like freon<br/>
Your bitches on my pecans, she got a ass you can eat on<br/>
Tryna play tough, like the leather on the recline<br/>
I hit it 'til I could seat on<br/>
Tryna get her freak on<br/>
Asked me to R. Kelly her<br/>
And get peed on, I said that ain't me, ma<br/>
The eight behind me, still got the burner<br/>
Yes, the Enzo is still black like Sojourner<br/>
Truth, I mighta just loosened a tooth<br/>
Spittin' what I did in the booth, I'm out, poof!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Carrera, raised in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle era<br/>
Water bearer tell the truth, I dare ya<br/>
You lie, so eat this whole bottle of these jalapeno peppers<br/>
The terror made in America, too live<br/>
Fuck the property, or give me my props properly<br/>
High off life, this high-technology, DeVry<br/>
Now, rap Muhammad Ali, more like rapology<br/>
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived<br/>
So gimme that, gimme that, keep God, where my city at?<br/>
I'm like steak and fries, but never died<br/>
They wanna Ghostface Wallabee me<br/>
But they will posthaste follow me into the afterlife<br/>
That means you goin' right after I've<br/>
But I'm the hero, sorta like Jack Sparrow<br/>
So some way, somehow, I have survived<br/>
<br/>
Ha, ha, surprise!<br/>
<br/>
Who is he that we see comin' over the tides?<br/>
In a speedboat, boatload of pride<br/>
Fall Of Rome dress-shirted and the Mastermind tie<br/>
He what happens when rappin' and avant garde fashion collide<br/>
OMG, it's the C from the CRS<br/>
LOLing at you haters, tell your BFFs like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Yes, Mr. West just turned that new child rebel<br/>
Loud as a bad-ass child level<br/>
Who need a chorus? We do it Tyrannosaurus<br/>
Tyrone, it's been a year with no phone<br/>
Could you explain how high is your zone?<br/>
We'll take a plane, rub his nose in cocaine<br/>
His ho's in magazines, you lames stay in your lane<br/>
And for the hate, in advance pull down your pants<br/>
Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we livin' in France<br/>
Diamonds bluish, business manager's Jewish<br/>
And if I get sued, my lawyers Jews<br/>
Some girls do grab the cojones<br/>
Said you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra loan us<br/>
Brand new Ferraris, I gotta make the donuts<br/>
CRS is like a hip-hop Christmas bonus<br/>
Niggas is hatin' on the Internet? I couldn't tell<br/>
I was too busy rappin' good as hell<br/>
I was too busy flying - parasail<br/>
Get Collette to get the new shit that Paris sell<br/>
Tarantino, da Vinci, gettin' Benji's<br/>
Get half off at Fendi, half of that's to Cindy's<br/>
Hopped out the spaceship, put my Mork in Mindy<br/>
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me<br/>
Props to New York, but Chi-town's the city<br/>
Give my city hoochies Gucci, Monica Bellucci's<br/>
Are those the real Millionaires or the bendies?<br/>
I'm so ultra I'm even over Oprah<br/>
Well, let me check your account - ha, ha, no sir!
