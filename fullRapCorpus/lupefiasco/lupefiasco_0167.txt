I’m beamin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Asher Roth:]</i><br/>
My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis<br/>
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad<br/>
The neural path I’ve traveled has immediate reaction<br/>
Can’t you see that I am beaming? I’ll be leaving in a second<br/>
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions<br/>
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action<br/>
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present<br/>
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house’s zenith<br/>
Yes, the fence intimidates, it’s meant to keep you out (But)<br/>
Let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound (‘Cause)<br/>
Freedom isn’t found inside a visa or a crown<br/>
And even the voice of reason couldn’t speak it out loud (But)<br/>
Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported<br/>
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole)<br/>
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic<br/>
As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charles Hamilton:]</i><br/>
Rey Mysterio flow, stayin’ clear<br/>
Of makeup-smeared hatin’ queers, makin’ clear this is spiritual<br/>
Though a spirit you owe, church final<br/>
Your funeral in an arena, you searchin’ for fire<br/>
Or titles, or tidal waves<br/>
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it’s 95 to 98<br/>
To throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!) (Beam!)<br/>
Boa constrictor, chokin’ (Niggas!), the grown man (Beam!)<br/>
Pawns mean, your controllers get broken (Niggas!) (Beam!)<br/>
Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (Niggas!) (Beam!)<br/>
Love, I get none, like sayin’ no to niggas<br/>
Hamiltonian’s loneliness, so I hold my (Beams!) (N-ggas!)<br/>
I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display<br/>
Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won’t go away<br/>
I keep pressin’ like my phone is afraid<br/>
To be a star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together<br/>
Fire like the fire flower, flyer than the super feather<br/>
Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap<br/>
You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme<br/>
You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris<br/>
Foolishness, Lu been doin’ this since super letters<br/>
So I can’t spell and can’t mail it out<br/>
If you can’t feel, it’s too full, you can’t peel it out<br/>
Showboatin’ at the show, but you can’t sell it out<br/>
I’m on the sea shepherd deck, helpin’ the whales out<br/>
All my egos in the mirror, checkin’ themselves out<br/>
Tweeters in the trunk, helpin’ the twelves out<br/>
The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne<br/>
This track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes<br/>
Yes, sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up<br/>
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mikey Rocks:]</i><br/>
Big up to what’s been up, nigga<br/>
Pinups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good<br/>
And the kids connected up, and they clicked snap<br/>
Hollerin’, “Yeah, we weighed on the iPhone scale app!”<br/>
Without fail, the best to ever do it just will<br/>
Haven’t done it all, but we got copy wheelwell, though<br/>
But it ain’t no sweat, I got a whole outfit<br/>
And a new fitted cap that I ain’t wore out yet<br/>
(Check, check, check) And I’m beamin’<br/>
Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith<br/>
Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D<br/>
Now we NBA’d up from development leagues<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chuck English:]</i><br/>
Ay, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell<br/>
Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail<br/>
Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window<br/>
Of whatever ‘Lac truck pick her up, retail<br/>
Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi<br/>
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby<br/>
Grab my coattails and get a grip (Grab ‘em)<br/>
You want the truth? Well, the truth is<br/>
This is it, pointin’ out the differences<br/>
This is exquisite shit, riveting, isn’t it?<br/>
Lizard king loafers on swole when I’m kickin’ it<br/>
Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole<br/>
You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Blu:]</i><br/>
Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggas’ shoulder off<br/>
Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y’all’s<br/>
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all<br/>
Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God<br/>
Gobble Gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw<br/>
Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on<br/>
So gone, strode strong through your lawn ’til the dawn<br/>
Tell you mom, name another real as John, kill a song<br/>
‘Cause when you feel it, and it make yo’ ass chill and calm<br/>
Payin’ more than just attention for that glass I’m sippin’ on<br/>
Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad<br/>
Kiddin’, ma? Scratch backs, bringin’ out them kitten paws<br/>
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen’s warm<br/>
Back to attendin’ business, do not lay them digits wrong<br/>
Dippin’ all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John<br/>
This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Diggy Simmons:]</i><br/>
I know what you’re thinkin’, thinkin’ I do not belong<br/>
Tell me Diggy ain’t beamin’, ‘course I should be on this song<br/>
Yeah, I’m a child of God, my reflection is on<br/>
Yeah, I’m only 15 and, but my sixteens is strong<br/>
Didn’t want me to shine, now we sharin’ the stage<br/>
Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age<br/>
So the remains, and it ain’t even how<br/>
That Verizon flow, are you hearin’ me now?<br/>
Word to Wasalu, they was sayin’ my future was dark<br/>
I had the fame, but my name was missin’ the art<br/>
So I’m drawin’ the line, and I’m crossin’ the Ts<br/>
And I’m dottin’ my I’s, barely catchin’ my Z’s<br/>
But I’ll be good by the mornin’, on my global grind like JoJo<br/>
They be lookin’ at what I’m puttin’ on and, so fly, so fresh at the Soho<br/>
Most niggas don’t know though, they can catch me on the first flight<br/>
Been workin’ on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe<br/>
But I did it for the love, no check, mate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dosage:]</i><br/>
When people said I couldn’t, I wouldn’t, I made ‘em believers<br/>
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers<br/>
From the City of Brotherly Love, they sayin’ we need you<br/>
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil<br/>
Some people hate it, but I made it, so I’m never concerned<br/>
About what they be talkin’ about, I’ve lived and I’ve learned<br/>
With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn<br/>
In this business, because I’m in control, meetin’ adjourned<br/>
I said, "It’s Third Degree, y’all heard of we?<br/>
I’m Dosage, have you heard of me?"<br/>
I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be<br/>
Where people say it doesn’t matter to be much<br/>
I was on the Steppin’ Lasers tour, and man, I shooked it up<br/>
That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up<br/>
If you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!)<br/>
Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends<br/>
I just want to say I remember when<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.o.B.:]</i><br/>
Well, it’s B to the O, O to the B<br/>
You know it’s the flow, you know that it’s me, I flow to this beat<br/>
As easy as goin’ to the store and holdin’ receipts<br/>
And foldin’ ‘em neat, I’m focused as focused can be<br/>
You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace<br/>
Or things could get heated and you’ll get ferociously beat<br/>
Speakin’ of ferociously beat, you know that girl ‘Nique?<br/>
You know she’s a freak, but anyway, back to what I’m supposed to be<br/>
Sayin’ all over this beat, you know that we G’s<br/>
You see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings<br/>
Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah<br/>
And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam<br/>
It’s the All City varsity, hard-headed squad<br/>
We played y’all spades, y’all handle y’all cards<br/>
But we ain’t all odds, we just blaze, man<br/>
Y’all playin’ checkers in this game, this is chess, y’all pawns
