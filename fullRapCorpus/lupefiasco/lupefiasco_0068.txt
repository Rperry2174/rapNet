Microphone check, I make them all bounce<br/>
Every teller in Bank of America, make them all count<br/>
You gone need the whole staff to add up the amount<br/>
It's going to take to pay me off to keep me out your house<br/>
<br/>
To keep me in my zone so that I don't zone out<br/>
I'm Rich (Boy) and Po (low the Don) like Zone 4, thoughts is deep like Tone Loc<br/>
Walk with me like old folk, cross your street a score's goaled<br/>
I don't rap, I hockey rink, cause my flow is so cold<br/>
<br/>
I am on my "mmhmm," they are on they "Oh, No!"<br/>
I am really in here/hair, they ain't real like Soul Glo<br/>
Don't you know I'm so sure, them nigga's got no glow<br/>
Find a master 'fore you can come back into the dojo<br/>
<br/>
Lupe got his mind right, nigga this is my mic<br/>
And I've come to take it all back like Miller High Life<br/>
He must not be tied tight, back against the wall<br/>
He will throw a ball like he playing Jai Alai<br/>
<br/>
I'll do the register, you just get them fries right<br/>
I don't trust America after watching Zeitgeist<br/>
Take a look at my stripes, chest looks like a tiger arm<br/>
and I'm hot as tiger balm, fire like a five-alarm<br/>
<br/>
And it's set to Tire Barn, Get your fire-fighter on<br/>
I ain't worried about you hoes/hose, I don't even need to roll<br/>
I turn down your ex like how you put your tires on<br/>
Once I get these tires on, I buy a bomb and tie it on<br/>
<br/>
And ride this around the entire song, find a line to drive it on<br/>
Park it near a metaphor, wait for it, the timer's on<br/>
You can turn your hydrants on, I'll just turn my wipers on<br/>
Wipe it off then wipe me down but don't forget about my bomb
