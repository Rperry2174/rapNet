I was born in a small village<br/>
I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers<br/>
Foreign soldiers<br/>
Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language<br/>
With each new post, my masters changed<br/>
Along with the words they made me speak<br/>
With each change, I changed too<br/>
My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong<br/>
Words can kill<br/>
Time and again, the country was ruled by a foreign tongue<br/>
When he was young boy, he lost his native language<br/>
The bedrock for any developing child<br/>
His country, his family, his face, his identity<br/>
Everything was stolen from him<br/>
<br/>
Meet me on the corner, I be waiting on you<br/>
Thousand years of better right into forever<br/>
Fire on my feathers, far from out of heaven<br/>
Fight without a weapon, life without a lesson<br/>
Lost, I'm my own boss, pay my own cost<br/>
Fill my own goals, see my own hopes<br/>
Tired of all of this, wish I had a switch<br/>
One kiss then you cut me off<br/>
Knowledge is the power, college is for cowards<br/>
Hollering for hours, swallowing the sour<br/>
Skin stuck around the rims, peeking in on a life so sweet<br/>
The other side made it, why don't we?<br/>
<br/>
From ancient times, every civilization's ruler has had the same idea.<br/>
When people unite under one will, they become stronger than the sum of their parts and what do rulers use to bring people together?<br/>
Language. "This world will become one, I have found the way.<br/>
Race, tribal affiliations, national borders - even our faces will be irrelevant.<br/>
The world that the boss envisioned will finally become a reality and it will make mankind whole again<br/>
<br/>
Found a friend in the words and my words and it works<br/>
Take away the pain, take away the hurt<br/>
Make a way to make a change, make it sane<br/>
Specially if you plan on staying on this Earth<br/>
Low to the lows, high to the highs<br/>
Eyes to the sky, strive to revive, dying to survive<br/>
Pool full of cries but it's cool, I'm still alive<br/>
And every breath is every left soul<br/>
And the family never kept whole<br/>
In the slum, want to quest to be the best of being less<br/>
Never let go, the best road to the next level<br/>
And the scenes where it's mean to do the right thing<br/>
Not to be a good king but the best devil<br/>
So it's horns for the crown, torn from the ground<br/>
Roses by the roots stolen from the roofs on parade days<br/>
Look at them rain down<br/>
I was brought here a slave<br/>
But I leave here a pharaoh<br/>
<br/>
America is a country of liberty, a meeting of immigrants<br/>
Instead of simply assimilating, its citizens live alongside others<br/>
So the major sought a system that used information<br/>
Words to control the subconscious<br/>
In his eyes, the greatest symbiotic parasite the world's ever known isn't microbial - it's linguistic<br/>
Words is what keep civilization, our world, alive<br/>
<br/>
If you are what you say you are, the coolest<br/>
Won't you just shine down?<br/>
You are what you say you are, the coolest<br/>
Won't you just shine down?
