<i>[Chorus (Snoop Dogg):]</i><br/>
There's a world go a-head and stair<br/>
(treat these folks don't need permission my life's in hi-definition)<br/>
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears<br/>
(I don't need no no intermission my life's in hi-definition)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
And my return, is more like a re-up<br/>
I hold a hold like a tea-cup<br/>
World in one hand, while the other hand throw a peace up<br/>
My other hand throwing We without the e up<br/>
I got like five more man I'm something like sheefa<br/>
In the fall of Rome number four Delux<br/>
See I've been around the world like the nomb<br/>
But I come from a zone where the homes are beat up<br/>
The folks unknown and the stones all meet up<br/>
Police tap my phone and ma's own on speaker<br/>
Said he's back with poems got their domes all leaked up<br/>
To get back on the thrown and become young leaders<br/>
Oprah put it on my culture now if that ain't wrong<br/>
Imus got it from the rhymers now if that ain't blown<br/>
They gave my man forty four now if that ain't long<br/>
I put it all on my shoulders now if that ain't strong<br/>
I made it out alive from the streets of the westside C-H-I<br/>
Now if that ain't home you better tell em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Snoop Dogg)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
And in my flyness I've become the hero and the sidekick<br/>
The rider and the nigga that'll ride with<br/>
In your ear like the maker of the vivrant<br/>
Asalamalakam to the maker of the vivrant<br/>
Them other niggas I don't vibe with<br/>
Now I was bout three when the eyes went<br/>
But I could see everything that you trying to be<br/>
You can't hide it<br/>
While you coming out your throte like a heimlich<br/>
I came up out the belly like an high scip<br/>
Only my circumstance reviced it<br/>
Hijacked the road and when they shot the pilot<br/>
I'm trying to go public so I can get to private<br/>
Then send Busy to go and get the pirates<br/>
Then hit Africa and try to fix the Virus<br/>
Go back to the hood tell Huggy open the hydrents<br/>
R.I.P Stack B. I'm gonna keep you alive kid<br/>
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful<br/>
F-N-F and S-N double O-P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Snoop Dogg)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Lupy it's snoopy lets go out<br/>
Tip toe through the door do it doggy style<br/>
And tell all my chicks in Chicago<br/>
Lupy hit the Lotto, Snoopy hit the bottle<br/>
Hold the mic tight they bite and might swallow<br/>
Take this chill pill will make you swallow<br/>
Recital is very homicidal<br/>
The big screen will capture you, cause it's hi-definition<br/>
Listen cooking collard greens in the kitchen<br/>
Them alphabet boys on a mission<br/>
If you ever get cash you better get it quick fast<br/>
Cause now-a-days niggas get the snitching on your bitch ass<br/>
Get it boys best believe in your toys out your game<br/>
Specially when a nigga know your real name<br/>
Blam blam with the blammer<br/>
Smile nephew your on candit camera, film at eleven<br/>
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful<br/>
F-N-F and S-N double O-P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Snoop Dogg)]</i>
