Okay, what up to my whirlwind, turn like tilt-a-whirls<br/>
I be throwin' up my set, yes! 'Urlin' up the world and<br/>
Goin' out, we goin' in, say "Hello" to my girlfriend<br/>
Vomiting and conquering - That C-class is a "girl benz"<br/>
<br/>
My class is overseas, I be on all around the world rims<br/>
Women's international, my will is like my girl: thin<br/>
Goin' in is goin' wild, goin' in is goin' strong<br/>
Goin' for the gold somewhere that goin' in is goin' on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Record scratch, music stops]</i><br/>

<br/>
I can do this all day, I ain't got an arcade<br/>
They all say I'm wall short of a whole hallway<br/>
One Hall's short to keep from coughin' all in y'all face<br/>
Man, I'm so appalled, I can keep them all safe<br/>
<br/>
I can really ball and put them titties all in y'all face<br/>
That was Robert Paulson, and that deserves a pausin'<br/>
So, that's block piercin', all that's missin' is the bearer<br/>
For the coffin that is needed for this beat when I'm done talkin'<br/>
<br/>
Ballin' in the mornin', this feel like my callin'<br/>
It's the new witches brew, fall off in my cauldron<br/>
Lupe's goin' crazy, flow is goin' almonds<br/>
We goin' back to goin' in, you gonna need a Garmin<br/>
<br/>
Then go and get a car and put your Garmin and my broad in<br/>
Destination: everywhere, reputation: everywhere<br/>
Music drop, music stop, one man take up every chair<br/>
I know that that ain't very fair how one man take up everywhere<br/>
<br/>
But it ain't for long though, it'll be some closure<br/>
Or maybe I'll be everywhere after I'm all over<br/>
Say goodbye then start the show, fall on off then start to blow<br/>
Actin' like I'm rappin', it's that Joaquin Phoenix Facebook flow<br/>
<br/>
Flow is in the microwave, call it Michael Tyson flow<br/>
Killin' is a dirty job - Michael Myers, Michael Rowe<br/>
Bring it back like Michael Fox, see how far them Michaels go<br/>
I feel like I'm Michael Crichton writin' with a microphone<br/>
<br/>
I ain't sayin' that you should die, but you should leave your life alone<br/>
Maybe borrow one of mine, fast life, life at home<br/>
Life is like a box of chocolates, pockets full of Toblerones<br/>
Rocket full of wallets for what continent we shoppin' on
