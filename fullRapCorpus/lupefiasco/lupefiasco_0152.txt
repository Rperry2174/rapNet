<i>[Haley Williams - Hook]</i><br/>
Can we pretend that airplanes<br/>
In the night sky<br/>
Are like shooting stars<br/>
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)<br/>
Can we pretend that airplanes<br/>
In the night sky<br/>
Are like shooting stars<br/>
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Wishes that the world could see<br/>
From the position of my girl and me<br/>
From the perspective of laying on the hood of a car<br/>
Looking up at the stars with all the connections cut<br/>
Cause when you stuck, advantages vanishes<br/>
bandages on the damages of what depression does<br/>
So quest it cuz, who are they to question us?<br/>
Beating up our ear drums like Question Love<br/>
With all of their requests from above<br/>
Press from below, only directions to bus<br/>
Thus we laying in the cut on the Cutlass supreme<br/>
Looking up at the scene<br/>
Hoping it doesn’t cut, the fresh and the make up<br/>
Get re-fed the lines and reminded of what they mean<br/>
The importance of really acting like they important<br/>
And if you don’t feel ‘em you should force ‘em now…<br/>
<br/>

Can we pretend that airplanes<br/>

I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)<br/>

<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Wishes that mend the broken heart<br/>
Fill the open palm, pardon my flow and thoughts<br/>
My departure from the norm, the parch thats more warm<br/>
walks on from the marching of your armies and the dropping of your bombs<br/>
The walking on the waters now stomping on the pond<br/>
The ripples now a wave<br/>
It can’t be peaceful with a pistol in your face<br/>
You can’t beat the people so you picking on they place<br/>
I jump to defend I’m wage with a page<br/>
My pen’s mightier than them and I got missles on the stage<br/>
This couch is for the cowards and stretchers for the brave<br/>
And I happily lay upon the bed that I have made<br/>
Like house keep, sheets and pillow case<br/>
But I don’t sleep, dreams keeping me awake<br/>
They went up thinking they would never touch the ground<br/>
But we gon wish it ‘pon ‘em on the way back down<br/>
<br/>
