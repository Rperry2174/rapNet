<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
The coolest nigga, what? The coolest nigga, what? <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
The coolest nigga, what? The coolest nigga, what?<br/>
The coolest nigga, what? The coolest nigga, what?<br/>
The coolest nigga, what? The coolest nigga, what?<br/>
The coolest nigga, what? The coolest nigga, what?<br/>
Lord please have sympathy<br/>
And forgive my cool young history (Michael Young History)<br/>
As...<br/>
The coolest nigga, what? The coolest nigga, what?<br/>
The coolest nigga, what? The coolest nigga, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I love the lord<br/>
But sometimes it's like that I love me more<br/>
I love the peace, and I love the war<br/>
I love the seas, and I love the shore<br/>
No love for no beach, baby that's law<br/>
But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil<br/>
I trick, I fall, run up in raw<br/>
I love her with all my heart<br/>
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged<br/>
With every flower that I ever took apart<br/>
She said, that she would give me greatness, status, placement<br/>
Above the others, my face with grace covers of the magazines<br/>
Of the hustlers, paper, the likes of which<br/>
That I had never seen, her eyes glow green<br/>
With the logo of our dreams, the purpose of our scene<br/>
A obscene obsession for the bling<br/>
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together<br/>
She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever<br/>
And I would never feel pain<br/>
And never be without pleasure, ever, again<br/>
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry<br/>
She would cry, just so I could drink the tears from her eyes<br/>
She'd teach my how to fly, even cushion my fall<br/>
If my engines ever stall, and I plummet from the sky<br/>
But she would keep me high, and if I ever die<br/>
She would commission my image on her bosom, to him<br/>
Or maybe she'd retire as well<br/>
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell, and I'll be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And so began our reign<br/>
The trinity, her and I can<br/>
No weather man could ever stand where her and I came<br/>
Hella hard, umbrella whatever, put plywood over Pella panes<br/>
And pray to God that the flood subside<br/>
'cause you're gonna need a sub 'til he does reply<br/>
And not one of Jared's, you think it's all arid<br/>
And everything's irie, another supply<br/>
That means another July inside my endless summer<br/>
That was just the eye of the Unger<br/>
Felix, 'cause he is the cleanest amongst the younger<br/>
Outstanding achieving up-and-comers<br/>
The ones that had dead-beat daddies, and well-to-do mamas<br/>
But not well enough to keep 'em from us<br/>
The ones that were, fighting in class, who might not pass<br/>
Rap record pressured to laugh, at a life not fast<br/>
Can you feel it? <i>[echo]</i>, that's what I got asked<br/>
Do I love her? <i>[echo]</i>, said I don't know<br/>
Streets got my heart, game got my soul<br/>
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul<br/>
Quote: To a crying dishonored baby mama<br/>
Who's the mama to a daughter that I had fathered from afar<br/>
My new lady gave me a Mercedes and a necklace<br/>
With a solid gold key, like the starter of a car<br/>
The opener of a door or two pounds of raw<br/>
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?<br/>
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-haw'ed, right up in her face, G<br/>
There's more fish in the sea, I'm on my mission to be, be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Come, these are the tales of The Cool<br/>
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school<br/>
And seek unholy grails like a fool<br/>
And hang with the players of the pool, fast talking on the hustle<br/>
No Heaven up above you, no Hell underneath you<br/>
And nowhere will receive thee, so<br/>
Shed no tear, when we're not here<br/>
And keep your faith, as we chase<br/>
...The Cool
