<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Take me to that old familiar place<br/>
Take me to memories we won't erase<br/>
Take me to all that we had<br/>
Good and the bad<br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll never let you go<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll always remember, I hope you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Let the record reflect the records we set<br/>
Best foot forward with every step<br/>
And let's push towards it, never regress<br/>
And let's remember, if ever we get<br/>
Down, the places that we came from 'round<br/>
And all the good times on the bad side of town<br/>
The upside of bad, flip it upside down<br/>
Came from the bottom but we up high now<br/>
Believe, and from this view we achieved<br/>
We looked back at the rules we received<br/>
And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those<br/>
And the ghost still alive in the photos<br/>
Sounds of the summer, day and go wise<br/>
Cold wind blowin' through a city on fire<br/>
Moments of the past, came here to find you<br/>
Not to relive them, just to remind you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Take me to that old familiar place<br/>
Take me to memories we won't erase<br/>
Take me to all that we had<br/>
Good and the bad<br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll never let you go<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll always remember, I hope you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
And let the evidence show, the future's so bright<br/>
It's never been more, not like tonight<br/>
We walk into the glow, right into the light<br/>
The past all around us, the time of our life<br/>
The first love kisses, the broke heart disses<br/>
This is just like a first-class ticket<br/>
Back, to the first written rap<br/>
The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap<br/>
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat<br/>
The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin' crack<br/>
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch<br/>
Stories from the project we could never go at<br/>
Or to, these are shades of my youth<br/>
Trials of a child, everything truth<br/>
Moments of the past, comin' back to find us<br/>
Not to relive them, just to remind us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Take me to that old familiar place<br/>
Take me to memories we won't erase<br/>
Take me to all that we had<br/>
Good and the bad<br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll never let you go<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll always remember, I hope you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Everything cherished, remembered in my heart<br/>
So you will never perish, you will never part<br/>
I tell â€˜em all about you, drummin' in the park<br/>
We put you in the ground, but I see you in the stars<br/>
Go'n, take a bow, a round of applause<br/>
The best that ever, always ready we are<br/>
Love always shines, that's how I'll find you<br/>
In case you forgot, I hope this reminds you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Take me to that old familiar place<br/>
Take me to memories we won't erase<br/>
Take me to all that we had<br/>
Good and the bad<br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll never let you go<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
I'll always remember, I hope you know
