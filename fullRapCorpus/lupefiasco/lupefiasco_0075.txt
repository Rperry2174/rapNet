It's Hirst/hearse verses and Murakami/murder coming rhyming<br/>
All my raps is (superflat), all your raps is super wack<br/>
Tell him that the future's back, DeLorean rolling down the block<br/>
You can call it shooting craps, and my roof is back<br/>
And my wings is up<br/>
Kingda Ka without Kahlua, so you ain't got to pour the king a cup<br/>
Young Yakuza but, none of my fingers cut<br/>
So I can still sip Red Zinger with my pinkies up<br/>
Made/maid man, you can call this cleaning up<br/>
I'm OCD, I never think it's clean enough<br/>
That's what defines me, I never think it's mean enough<br/>
Lines deeper than those waiting on a sneaker, cuz<br/>
You gone need two heads like the King of Clubs just to figure out the meaning of<br/>
I'm just achieving buzz so stay out of son/sun way like you're drinking blood<br/>
This is what it feels like to be in love<br/>
<br/>
I mean come on, I mean look at what I'm dropping here<br/>
Do this for the block and the blogosphere<br/>
No, you ain't ready for the heavy, so I'll keep it light as jogging gear<br/>
I don't want the throne, I want the helicopter rocking chair<br/>
Jay gave me a co-sign like I was RocaWear, but be clear I'm not the air/heir<br/>
I'm the water, fire and the earth<br/>
That means I'm doing dirt, spitting flames and quenching thirst<br/>
And plus the real God has been on my side since birth<br/>
I hope that he forgives me, I hope I do his work in every single verse<br/>
Now I might do a dance, I might even jerk, tell them niggas don't hate<br/>
Only God is great, Enemy Of The State
