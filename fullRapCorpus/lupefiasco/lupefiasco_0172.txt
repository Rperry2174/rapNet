I had to complete Mazinger Z. I had to, I had to<br/>
Why did you have to Grandfather?<br/>
To wreck all of Dr Hell's evil plans.<br/>
Mazinger Z is clad in ultra alloy Z and is operated by photo atomic energy.<br/>
It contains mighty weapons of all kinds.<br/>
That robot is perfect. There is nothing to correct or adjust.<br/>
Koji, Shiro, that robot is all yours.<br/>
My only regret is that I cannot stay alive to watch you boys operate that robot.<br/>
With Mazinger Z you can either become a God or a Devil.<br/>
You'll be known as a super being. Now go!<br/>
<br/>
Sinister times, pacific the rims so I live in the mind<br/>
Sit in the head of the shit I design<br/>
Position it bent so I sit in recline<br/>
But never I sleep<br/>
Tears out the eyes is the weather I weep<br/>
Give cheddar to beggars to better my keep<br/>
Don't turn a back and never a cheek<br/>
Won't be here forever, we sever, we cease<br/>
A liar who said that we never release<br/>
Nooses surroundin' the neck of the beast<br/>
Loosing they pounds on the treasure beneath<br/>
200 pounds under pressure decrease<br/>
Reducing the sound to a set of beliefs<br/>
Devil's a trick like they sent the police<br/>
Is it or nah's (Nas) like wedded Kelis<br/>
So not the same like a Jet and a Jeep<br/>
One in the clouds, the other up under him running around<br/>
Unlike the one never touching the ground<br/>
Some like the one cause it doesn't come down<br/>
Unlike the oven that's under the town<br/>
Liquor the fire they jump in and drown<br/>
Wait till they die it's for something profound<br/>
Head is so dreaded for clutching the crown<br/>
And keeping it standing when jumping around<br/>
Feeding the animals, touching the hounds<br/>
Eating with cannibals, lunch in the lounge<br/>
Keeping it manual, clutch in announced<br/>
Eating the actual, reaping the benefits<br/>
Repeat the annual, bleeping the fouls<br/>
Something about (something about)<br/>
Reaching the valuable, touching the down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - PJ:]</i><br/>
You came by yourself my darling<br/>
But you know we're not alone<br/>
Oh get yourself in order<br/>
Before they're calling you home<br/>
It could be wonderful<br/>
So tell me what is it you're waiting for?<br/>
No don't you go too far<br/>
Cause soon they'll be calling you home<br/>
They calling you home<br/>
<br/>
(Either become a God or a Devil)<br/>
(Either be-, either become a God or a Devil)<br/>
Yeah you know they calling home<br/>
(God or a Devil, either be-, either become a God or a Devil)<br/>
Yeah you know they calling home<br/>
<br/>
Lovin' the Lord<br/>
Covet the lovers of governor or<br/>
Dozen in love with the covets or more<br/>
In concerts with converts-who-cover galore<br/>
Wash off they feet and then cover the floor<br/>
Mother the ships so come hover aboard<br/>
To raptures and ruptures start flooding the shore<br/>
Pushing and shoving and punching with oars<br/>
Thuggin' and judging, no plugging the holes<br/>
Sink to the bottom like sex in the kitchen, no food in the fridge but it's nut on the stove<br/>
It's what on the what?<br/>
Like Monica sucking and bust right on her clothes<br/>
Dishonouring Monica what is it for?<br/>
Monitor Monica, what does she know?<br/>
Finding the evidence, answering the questions<br/>
Did you and the president fuck on the low?<br/>
Room full of elephants, elegant elements, breaking it down she touching her toe<br/>
Triple A coming to give her a jump and her engine construction don't function no more<br/>
It's killing her options to live in a box when they filling their stockings with lumps of the coal<br/>
Finding the diamonds with dynamite, fighting the fire is hiding while wiping the pole<br/>
Sliding off slightly to siphon the go<br/>
She biting her neck like she vampire-like, ain't no lighten her load<br/>
With the tide and a bleach at the laundromat black trying to whiten her clothes<br/>
So maybe she can sneak into heaven, hmm yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
