Niggas wanna win<br/>
These niggas wanna win<br/>
These niggas wanna win<br/>
Everybody wanna be a mothafuckin' winner<br/>
That ain't how it work though, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Ayy, ayy, disproportionate convictions<br/>
Especially when it come to our case (our case)<br/>
You seen the movie, they killed the nigga<br/>
Why you wanna be like Scarface?<br/>
That's why niggas gon' lose<br/>
Oh yeah, I said it, niggas gon' lose<br/>
And you can have a friend and you can have a Benz<br/>
One's sittin' down, the other's traffickin'<br/>
If you get the car then your friend dies<br/>
Havin' one keeps the other one from happenin'<br/>
I hope a nigga don't lose<br/>
Fuck that car, nigga<br/>
Niggas gon' lose<br/>
<br/>
And she want love, you only want sex<br/>
You got yours, she didn't get hers<br/>
She got no respect, y'all had a son<br/>
She like, "Fuck you," she only want a check<br/>
That lil' nigga gon' lose<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Mothafucka, niggas gon' lose<br/>
Yeah and these rap niggas talk about the hood<br/>
Like we all lames and they seen it<br/>
It's entertain', it's cool as hell<br/>
That beat dope, that don't mean shit<br/>
That's why niggas gon' lose<br/>
Fuck you talkin'? Niggas gon' lose<br/>
If they legalize that whole thing<br/>
They doin' weed, next cocaine<br/>
Niggas ain't gon' have no jobs<br/>
And Wall Street gon' run the dope game<br/>
What a nigga gon' do? Huh?<br/>
You niggas gon' lose<br/>
<br/>
And when you see me you don't see yourself<br/>
That's why I got no problem shootin' me<br/>
Willie Lynch set the shit up beautifully<br/>
One of the reasons niggas ain't got unity<br/>
That's why niggas gon' lose<br/>
Ayy fuck that shit, ayy, niggas gon' lose, yeah<br/>
And most hood niggas is good niggas<br/>
In a heartbeat, I'll shed blood for him<br/>
But he too stupid, he won't sit down<br/>
That nigga too hot, I got love for him<br/>
That nigga gon' lose<br/>
On my mama, that nigga gon' lose, yeah<br/>
And you did it 'cause your daddy did it<br/>
But he locked up in there and ain't happy with it<br/>
Do the same thing, get the same results<br/>
If your brain work then what's the matter with it?<br/>
You knew you was gon' lose<br/>
They told you, nigga<br/>
You was gon' lose<br/>
<br/>
I never met a saint, from no color<br/>
From nowhere, from no other<br/>
From no castle, from no gutter<br/>
It ain't nobody that don't suffer<br/>
Some niggas gon' lose<br/>
Some niggas gon' lose<br/>
Promised land, I don't believe that<br/>
Had a dream and I don't need that<br/>
Please God, send us some jobs<br/>
'Cause my niggas really really need that<br/>
Or niggas gon' lose<br/>
That's right, niggas gon' lose, yeah<br/>
And we sell dope then we turn around<br/>
Give the white people all our profits<br/>
Take a percentage of that, set it to the side<br/>
And send these lil' niggas off to college<br/>
So niggas don't lose<br/>
Yeah, niggas don't lose<br/>
And if they offer somethin', just take it<br/>
Then work hard, don't waste it<br/>
Every castle started at the basement<br/>
Yeah your manager's a racist<br/>
But you're the one that's gon' lose<br/>
That's right, niggas gon' lose<br/>
<br/>
And these niggas gon' lose, oh<br/>
I said, I said everybody wanna be a winner<br/>
Everybody wanna be a winner<br/>
Be a mothafuckin' winner<br/>
Never gotta worry 'bout nothin'<br/>
But some niggas gon' lose<br/>
Yeah so niggas don't lose<br/>
And it's fucked up, some niggas gon' lose<br/>
You wake up and you hear shots<br/>
Mean another nigga got his tear drops<br/>
And you call his phone and ain't pickin' up<br/>
And your stomach hurtin', that fear drops<br/>
I hope a nigga ain't lose
