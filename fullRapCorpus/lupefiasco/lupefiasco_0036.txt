<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
They Call Me Lupe I'll Be Your New Day<br/>
They Wanna Smell Like Me They Want My Bouquet<br/>
But They Cant They They Accented Like The UK<br/>
Turn That Ude Lupe To Pepe Le Peu Spray<br/>
Flagrantly Fragrant And They Can't Escape It<br/>
My Perfume Pursued Them Anywhere That They Went<br/>
You Don't Want A Loan Leave My Cologne Alone<br/>
It's A Little Too Strong For You To Be Putting On<br/>
Trust Me I Say This Justly<br/>
I Went From Musty To Musky And You all Can't Mush Me<br/>
I Warned You all Cornballs I Hush Puppies<br/>
The Swans In The Pond Called My Duck Ugly<br/>
But Now They Hug Me Because It's Lovely<br/>
They Love The Aroma Of A Roamer The World<br/>
Got The Shakers And The Skaters And The Player And The Girls<br/>
Keep The Fakers And The Flakers And The Haters In A Twirl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You Want The Flavor Ma<br/>
HEY! I Gotcha<br/>
You Want The Realness<br/>
WELL! I Gotcha<br/>
I Know You Sick Of Them Players Big Car And Watch Ya<br/>
Either They Pimps Or They Macks Or They Mobsters<br/>
You Want The Real Sh*t<br/>
HEY! I Gotcha<br/>
You See My Peoples Here<br/>
You Know We Proper<br/>
You We Do It<br/>
Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
And I'm From Chi-Town Thats Where I Flies 'Round<br/>
Keep Some Cartier Frames Over my Eyes Now<br/>
We Used To Gangbang A Lot Of That Done Died Down<br/>
Children Of The Hat Tiltin' Keeping Hope Alive Now<br/>
All With No High I Do It So Fly<br/>
Banksy's attack Helicopter With The Bow Tie<br/>
I Love My City Really Hope That God Bless It<br/>
Have My Mind Moving Faster Than That Hog In The Hedges<br/>
Welcome All Of You all To My Dark Recesses<br/>
This Is Where I Keep The Bars Like Bathtub Edges<br/>
My IVORIES And My DOVES My LEVERS AND MY ZEST'S<br/>
It Takes Half Of Your Bubble Bath To Match The Freshness<br/>
The Belly Of The Beast You Know I'm From It<br/>
I Wrap It In A Towel Here Go My Pal In The Stomach<br/>
And I Be On My Green Like IRISH SPRING And I COAST<br/>
Fudge Wit It And Get A Mouth Full Of Soap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
And So To Sign Off This Beat I Rhyme Off<br/>
Is From The Looniest P And Hugo Mind Boss<br/>
You Feel It In The Air Its Such A Fine Force<br/>
But You Don't Hear Me Though Just Like A Mime's *Thoughts*<br/>
That's Cause I'm In Europe Me And My Friends Tour'a<br/>
I'm On My Pimp My Temperature Is tem-pura<br/>
I Take It Easy On My Watch I'm Watching TV<br/>
Am I As Clean As Maharishi See The Hare Is Tryna Beat Me<br/>
As I Continue To Do Lu's Pace<br/>
They Say Him Got Two Heads And Four Eyes Just Like Screwface<br/>
But See My Secret's Safe Its In My Secret Safe<br/>
That's In My Secret Room On My Secret Base<br/>
So From The Runner Of The FNF Crew<br/>
Come In Hip Hop We've Come To Resurrect You<br/>
You, You, You, You, You, You, You, You, You, You, You,<br/>
<br/>
