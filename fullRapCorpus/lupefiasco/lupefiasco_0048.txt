<i>[Gemstones]</i><br/>
If we can break down those walls to set you freeee<br/>
we would, cause we out heeeere...<br/>
And we miss yooooou...<br/>
If we could build a ladder that tall to come and see yoooou<br/>
we would, cause we down heeeere...<br/>
And we miss yooooou...<br/>

<i>[Sarah Green and Gemstones]</i><br/>
If we can break down those walls to set you freeee<br/>
we would, cause we out heeeere...<br/>
And we miss yooooou...<br/>
If we could build a ladder that tall to come and see yoooou<br/>
we would, cause we down heeeere...<br/>
And we miss yooooou...<br/>
