Yield, to the forces of darkness<br/>
I bring you the torches of our shit<br/>
Reinforced with hardness of Wolverine’s<br/>
Arms with the harshness and overall sharpness<br/>
Now how far do the arms get?<br/>
My nigga, from the stars to the starfish<br/>
From the baby to the bomb<br/>
It’s a whole lot of light and a whole lot of armlift<br/>
My arms long, but I’m lawless<br/>
A strong arm, I can lift up all this<br/>
You gon’ have to build a bigger farm for us<br/>
To keep them wolves out of Old MacDonald barn, bitch<br/>
Yeah, Team Jacob<br/>
We’re long armed, put my arms on a lear<br/>
Everytime I put my hands in the air<br/>
Watch the throne as I dance in the chair<br/>
Throw my crown in the crowd, hope it lands on the heir<br/>
The weak niggas like to pass interfere<br/>
Spend a lot of lint over jams in the year<br/>
That act like the man up in here<br/>
That don’t count when your only real fan is a mirror<br/>
That’s subliminal to any nigga that he feel he is too<br/>
But you don’t stand a chance, playa<br/>
I am there, Chi-Town, fan of the Bears<br/>
Love where they dance in the square<br/>
Yeah, Yankees too, but only cause Granderson there<br/>
And now wears khaki pants on La Brea<br/>
We all friends, why your man lookin’ scared?<br/>
Turning whiter than Anderson hair<br/>
Came out the garage like he saw a phantom in there, huh<br/>
<br/>
Oh shit alert, Louis clothes<br/>
Callin women bitches, Louboutin and Gucci shows<br/>
Well, I guess there goes my Louis shows<br/>
More o shit, if your role model’s a movie role<br/>
And if you live your life like it’s a studio<br/>
Talkin’ to us like we mics, a bunch of you ain’t do befo’<br/>
Electric fences for a urinal<br/>
Also keep a toaster in my jacuzzi, yo<br/>
Shock-a-zulu, call me Wasalu II<br/>
Oh shit, man these record labels prostitute you<br/>
Strap them to sushi bars, and feed em lots of fugu<br/>
Catch a bad piece<br/>
You can stick that 360 between your asscheeks<br/>
Artists let’s mobilize and unionize like the athletes<br/>
Radio is making our craft weak<br/>
Forced to repeat the same dumb shit that work<br/>
Only as hot as your last beat<br/>
And rappers, they relating to that last piece<br/>
Album never leave they desk if you don’t got no B.D.S<br/>
Sacrifice your publishin’, they said you really need a hook<br/>
And they ain’t gon’ pay you, said that you received a look<br/>
And what’s stupid real, is what producers feel<br/>
Twenty placements or you stuck in that producer deal<br/>
And R&amp;B chicks so get it the wildest<br/>
All they money goes to hairdressers and stylists<br/>
Gotta keep up with that image<br/>
Label lose they mind if they ever see a blemish<br/>
ProActiv impeals, airbrushers and trainers<br/>
Managers suggest you fuck a nigga to be famous, huh<br/>
But it’s all entertainment<br/>
Wonder when Cobain blew out his brains, did he blame it?<br/>
And if those snakes in the industry helped him aim it<br/>
Started pressing up records before the bullet left the chamber<br/>
I fight evil, everyday I’m livin’<br/>
Rest in peace to men, women and the children<br/>
And middle fingers to the Pilgrims that killed ‘em<br/>
Friend of the People, happy Thanksgiving
