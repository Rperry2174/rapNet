Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above<br/>
Velvet hands in the upper glove, touch<br/>
Like bad double dutch<br/>
And two Amsterdam's ain't enough, d.r.u.g.s;<br/>
"Don't ruin us, God said", #DROGAS<br/>
Too much pride we electric slide, we should be closer<br/>
Like soda, nothin' changed but a chola<br/>
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures<br/>
Pay respects in my sensei's sculpture<br/>
High as the angel on the Dikembe's shoulder<br/>
Eyes looking like MKUltra<br/>
We deck the vision through these dark shades<br/>
Bad dreams through the screens of an arcade<br/>
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak<br/>
Park full of art, arteries full of parquet<br/>
'Bedient like new games, easily defeating<br/>
Or two gangs meeting for the evening<br/>
Or two feet on a Riesling, slow wind<br/>
Meditate to the slow mind<br/>
Decorate me with shine till I go blind<br/>
BDSM dominated it with no bind<br/>
Safe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain:]</i><br/>
Proceed to the next level<br/>
(Tron)<br/>
Proceed to the next level<br/>
(Tron)<br/>
<br/>
Coolest, tulips, flowers, fall from the towers<br/>
Like galls from Galileo to lay low<br/>
Ignorance that the world isn't ours, the God<br/>
Give them all showers<br/>
Toni found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of power<br/>
To only find truth in the fountain, drowning in power<br/>
Surrounded with dollars<br/>
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder<br/>
Cut, that's a mis-direct to stir the soul with dis-effect<br/>
Names don't last like Mr. X<br/>
Unless you Galilee dropping bowling balls on the discotheque<br/>
With a disco ball hanging 'round your neck<br/>
Dance, it's a new year<br/>
Every time I open my hands<br/>
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal<br/>
Yokozuna's don't throw salt in a circle<br/>
Sumo you up off off your turf boy<br/>
Tsunami you up off your surfboard<br/>
<i>[?]</i> Medusa in the go<br/>
'Fore Versace turned words into turquoise<br/>
Medusa turned coke into stone<br/>
With a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said<br/>
Proceed to the next level<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Troi:]</i><br/>
Sounds so far, seems so much<br/>
(Tron)<br/>
I cannot settle for good enough<br/>
So I'll sweat and I'll climb until I reach my prime<br/>
(Proceed to the next level)<br/>
The forces rise and fall again<br/>
Throw it up, will I reach the end<br/>
In my eyes, there's a fire and it takes me high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
Soulo!<br/>
Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be among the stars (space)<br/>
Backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (wavy)<br/>
Ab-solar system intergalactic soldier<br/>
Lupe say I'ma stoner, I say that I'm much bolder<br/>
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game<br/>
Scope this horror, aquarius's make it rain here<br/>
No love for your honor, only God can judge us<br/>
If you're Islamic, Allah, I've had enough to my collar<br/>
With these niggas castin' stones like this Mancala<br/>
Proceed to the next level, dig that with a platinum shovel<br/>
Black magic, matter of fact, if matter is fact<br/>
A matter factory is in the making perhaps<br/>
Uh, erase your database<br/>
We race against time, no time to set a date<br/>
Tattuo and youth induced<br/>
Too cool for school, unloose the noose and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Troi:]</i><br/>
With<br/>
Next level, next floor<br/>
I'm ready for it<br/>
I've been waiting all my life<br/>
Tron, Tron<br/>
We're going up, we're going up<br/>
Next level, next floor
