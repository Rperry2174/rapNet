<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
You look just like how I'ma be<br/>
Sacred geometry<br/>
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line<br/>
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sign<br/>
<br/>
With a platinum plaque<br/>
She like Robin, George, and Jack<br/>
The mind fears what the blinds hide<br/>
But I'm here on the blind side<br/>
Hanging up till the line dies<br/>
Then off the hook for the crimes try<br/>
Get awful looks from tribe tribe unlawful jux we can climb skies<br/>
That's Robin Hood, arrows of the rich'll steal<br/>
In Hollywood and featherweight I step by step let it escalate<br/>
Till you get it, we'll tell you if I hit it<br/>
When you make pie if you don't fidget<br/>
Xzibit Pimp My Ride exquisite<br/>
We G's coach us back if we die in business<br/>
My Lord is my chemist, my sword is some Khemet<br/>
Egyptian fonts and ankhs<br/>
Scottish write with Montblancs let us stomp<br/>
I walk as my father walk, master builder is what I thought<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Where the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen<br/>
And the over here's are the older things<br/>
Can see the bell but don't know the rings<br/>
The rings are not sounds, but circles<br/>
Wear these on your virtues<br/>
See through these circles just live Steve Urkel<br/>
Till it's all universal<br/>
And it harmonize and like the Porsche into the larger size<br/>
And it's dynamic in the high standard<br/>
So each degree has a part to price<br/>
See big worlds have little worlds that feed on their velocity<br/>
And little world have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
The applause and patience of the laws in nature<br/>
Override lies and the laws of nations<br/>
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations<br/>
Sun positions overcome traditions<br/>
Numbers govern our young religions<br/>
Dead levels making plum decisions<br/>
Perpendicular to the undivision<br/>
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned<br/>
Any love less than unconditional is so under Christian it's unrepentant<br/>
The physical part of my church emits the invisible arts of my work<br/>
To make gold from garbage is not the unchemical part of this map<br/>
But truth me told it's the pursuit of gold<br/>
That turns the goal of men into trash<br/>
The souls gold and they turning gold into cash<br/>
And your reflection is your connection to more collections of more directions and paths<br/>
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass<br/>
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half<br/>
<br/>
