Cold blooded, Chilly skin<br/>
Can't touch it like your front wheel when it's wheelying<br/>
Wanna set you free like Free Willy friend<br/>
Wanted to see Free Willy really swim<br/>
I'm super cold, my jacket thin<br/>
My tuba low like a marching band<br/>
That means I'm super-deep, you surface skim<br/>
I'm the whole thing, you niggas 2%<br/>
Put em up on that carton, I think I'm losing em<br/>
Bring all those St. Bernards in<br/>
Let's get some booze in them<br/>
You know them doggs with them barrels on they neck<br/>
And I'm a keep it cool like airholes on a Tec<br/>
I be moving birds like the scarecrows on the set<br/>
Part dope-ass nigga, an old man winner<br/>
Chrismastime diamond singing carols on my chest<br/>
Step up off the jet<br/>
Looking like a Pharoah in the flesh<br/>
<br/>
I'm super-cold<br/>
<br/>
I'm super-cold, my freezer deep<br/>
My cooler closed: air-conditioned seats<br/>
I dont trust them niggas, They conviction weak,<br/>
they be thawing out, My commitment keeps<br/>
12 months, hope that well jumps<br/>
Seems like selling souls is havin sells bumps<br/>
I be in to win while your sales slump<br/>
Your changes getting slim, mine on their 12th brunch<br/>
And they smell lunch: Hercules Klump <br/>
Throw my weight around<br/>
Ain't left the scale once<br/>
Always bear in mind: even with your white fur<br/>
We still polar opposites: you ice picks to icebergs<br/>
I'm colder than Universal Soldier<br/>
Angel on my back everywhere I'm at<br/>
Niggas don't believe it just when I lay it down<br/>
And when I get back up and see my angel on the ground...<br/>
<br/>
I'm Super-cold <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
Chicken soup for souls, now who could use a bowl?<br/>
Don't be salty now, trying to reduce my snow<br/>
Cause I just move em out: Ice Man<br/>
Fresh out a mutant's skull<br/>
I ain't no student though<br/>
Black Sean White and he skis, and he skates<br/>
And he leaves all types of cold tracks all behind me<br/>
And you can follow those if you ever wanna find me<br/>
Better dress warm or you might end up like the Shining<br/>
That boy or that lady with that nigga gone crazy<br/>
Pretty damn amazing: I can't get out<br/>
So I'm forced to ride this elevator anywhere it takes me<br/>
But when I hit my floor, I'm a open up my door<br/>
Won't be 3 stacks on your cousin, but just that super cold
