<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
For real though, like for real though<br/>
Like for real<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', I don't even<br/>
It's like, niggas must forget who the fuck<br/>
Did what the fuck<br/>
When the fuck<br/>
When niggas was still, not the fuck<br/>
Or whatever<br/>
Fine then, I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Dear Lord, have mercy on my banana clips<br/>
Give 'em half, call it that banana splits<br/>
But my halves is really like a banana 6<br/>
Do these bananas have any idea who they on the planet with?<br/>
Apes, yeah you bananas to the grapes<br/>
That mean your bitch got a banana in her face<br/>
And wine on her chin, get these heathens off of my trunk<br/>
And all of these swine up off my rims<br/>
Tryin' to take the shine up off of my Benz<br/>
SLR, nigga please<br/>
Niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave<br/>
Gon' roll around with that B-Y, nigga just roll up my sleeve<br/>
Got body plans, so I karate stance so I could open up my chi<br/>
Lu the boy, too Bruce Lee boy to destroy<br/>
Doo doo beat like two T-boys with one freak one me<br/>
But I can DP like it's three more<br/>
Three rewards for me or me or me or me or me or me<br/>
Team me is like meat eating animals meeting a meteor<br/>
Dinosaurs, I'm fine with all kinds of wars<br/>
Knives and swords, lions, tigers bitin' boars<br/>
Lightening striking Viking hordes<br/>
Fighting heightened, violence soars<br/>
<i>[German-sounding nonsense]</i><br/>
That was Adolf, reacting to my new shit<br/>
Translation: how come he can't be as evil as Lu get?<br/>
Well that's cause you ain't Lu, bitch<br/>
Took two sips of the holy grail<br/>
Then I backed up and I turned around<br/>
And I bent over and pittoo'd shit<br/>
I love Jay, that's my nigga<br/>
I feel sicker than a cruise ship<br/>
I ain't competition, I don't move shit<br/>
The only opposition is this new shit<br/>
These new niggas rappin' like they 2<br/>
They be actin' like they you, man that's - wheeeeeew shit<br/>
What happened to the game?<br/>
Niggas think they Jappin' cause they rappin' like they Wayne<br/>
Rappin' like they Chainz<br/>
I ain't matchin' them in platinum<br/>
But I'm rappin' like I'm flames<br/>
Like smackin' them in the back of him and my antonyms is on 'cain<br/>
And my heroin is on metaphors and my metaphors is on brains<br/>
My left foot is in LA but my right foot is in Spain<br/>
Now we all heard what he said, but what he said means we dead<br/>
And that shit is insane<br/>
He's so crazy, look at the little baby<br/>
Nigga you ain't Nas, nigga you ain't Jay-Z<br/>
You will respect me, you will reject me<br/>
But I've done so much, no matter how far you go, you will reflect me<br/>
SLR, nigga please<br/>
These niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave<br/>
And when the bitch gone, knee shots disabled<br/>
Your DVD of Dick Jones in your TV and a grenade all on your table.<br/>
And my punch bowl's like an ocean<br/>
And I lay it on by the ladle<br/>
But it's so strong, when I pull it out, I'm only hangin' on to<br/>
a handle<br/>
Satan on my ankles while I'm hangin' on to an angel<br/>
Ain't hatin' on that you hatin' wrong, cause you can't hang<br/>
on to my angles<br/>
It's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a Lupe stan<br/>
I ain't sayin' that I'm harder, it's just harder when it's in Lupe's hands<br/>
Welcome nigga, Lupe Land, SLR<br/>
Here we go, FL bars<br/>
Hold up, go back to the hard part<br/>
Would say pause, but I was talkin' 'bout my own balls<br/>
Nigga
