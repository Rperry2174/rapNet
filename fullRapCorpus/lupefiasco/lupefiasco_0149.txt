<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
And they say, and they say-ay-ay-ay, and they say<br/>
Uh, yeah, one time for the drama<br/>
Halcyon vibes got me feelin' like a llama<br/>
At peace with the beast in these streets<br/>
At least I think that I am<br/>
Meditate away the drama or I'ma just go bananas<br/>
Life's a beach but no Bahamas, I just wanna wear pajamas<br/>
Whole life I been fightin' on piranhas<br/>
With katanas inside of my hand<br/>
I just wanna lay down, play sounds for the coolout<br/>
And, fall asleep on the pool couch<br/>
And, wake up to the new wave<br/>
And, take a break from the schoolhouse<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
Wouldn't be in here without it, not true<br/>
I don't wanna be alone, I ain't leavin' you at home<br/>
What's bein' on your own without... you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jake Torrey:]</i><br/>
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Yeah, two times for the photo<br/>
Where the land man, I don't know<br/>
Revolution to the bone door<br/>
Underground styles, shoulda came out of Stone's Throw<br/>
Yeah, for the good food and good times<br/>
Good moves, good friends and a good mind<br/>
Confident you'll compliment my consciousness<br/>
'Cause you were born under this science<br/>
I just need a little peek<br/>
Little look in the book of important things<br/>
'Cause you can do, try to<br/>
Get loose without doin' a damn thing<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
Wouldn't be in here without it, not true<br/>
I don't wanna be alone, I ain't leavin' you at home<br/>
What's bein' in the zone without... you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jake Torrey:]</i><br/>
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
I'm singin' it, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
Yeah, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
<br/>
In the backseat or the backyard<br/>
Feel like we got no problems at all<br/>
I'm so happy when I'm with you, with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Make me feel so free when I'm with you, when I'm with you<br/>
Make me feel so free when I'm with you, when I'm with you<br/>
Three times to be good to myself<br/>
Relax back, that's good for my health<br/>
So do not devise on my bae<br/>
I don't wanna be with nobody else<br/>
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'<br/>
I ain't heard about nothin'<br/>
I ain't workin' on nothin'<br/>
But my perfect lil' woman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jake Torrey:]</i><br/>
Oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
Said oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child, like a wild child<br/>
I'm singin' now, oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
Yeah, said oh wow, you make me feel like a wild child<br/>
Oooh wild
