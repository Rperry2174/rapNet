Uh, meditate<br/>
On the floor, fold your legs, resonate<br/>
Breathing speed, regulate<br/>
Clear my mind till it levitate<br/>
Dhalsim, I beat the game,<br/>
Level 8, Hella good<br/>
Never great cause God is great<br/>
So ain't no G.O.A.T.S., ain't no gates<br/>
Fences see the rams ram, lambs let, sheep's skate<br/>
Brace yourself, teeth straight<br/>
Fix your face for Pete's sake<br/>
Birthday wordplay, piece of cake<br/>
Four-door flow with seats for eight<br/>
Ororo Munroe/my roll make it rain<br/>
Not with bills, I make it change<br/>
Take that cool shit, make it lame<br/>
Take that nerd shit, make it bang<br/>
Yeah, you heard us make it bang<br/>
Yeah, you heard me make it bang<br/>
Melt the change and make a ring<br/>
Take that ring and make a bracelet<br/>
Take that bracelet make a chain<br/>
Look how far my necklace hang<br/>
Connect that chain up to a crane<br/>
Pull the game up by the brains<br/>
Could not move it just with brains<br/>
So I had to use some bling<br/>
Shouts to Drizzy, shout to Wayne<br/>
Yeezy, Jeezy, Ricky, Fifty, Raekwon, Loso, Gucci Mane<br/>
I'm not going to drop my name<br/>
Sneak that message to the masses, you can call me Chocolate Rain<br/>
You might think my wallet drained<br/>
Look how far my pockets hang<br/>
That's cause I got pocket change<br/>
My net worth is basketball<br/>
They net worth is soccer games<br/>
Tell them niggas stop it man<br/>
But they cannot stop it man<br/>
So, they forced to watch it drain<br/>
They be looking so blue like water when I wash my jeans<br/>
King without the whoppers and, King without the pauper<br/>
and King and I ain't got no drains<br/>
Bruce Lee, dishwasher<br/>
Cleaning out your pots and pans<br/>
These niggas ain't got no stain<br/>
Power once I hit them with the powder<br/>
Then throw them in the shower<br/>
These nigga slower than some dial-up<br/>
I be on my broadband<br/>
These niggas still downloading<br/>
Lu finished, you still up on YouSendIt, uShare, zShare<br/>
How long you going to be there?<br/>
Damn<br/>
FinallyFast.com for you fam<br/>
Information super highway<br/>
These niggas ain't got no lane<br/>
But you can ride my shoulder<br/>
Like they pulled you over<br/>
I sit in the driver's seat<br/>
You sit on the sofa<br/>
I am Patrick Swayze<br/>
You are Whoopi Goldberg<br/>
Cause he was a beast and the way that he controlled her<br/>
Rest in peace to Patrick<br/>
Rest in Peace to Stacks, kid<br/>
Rest in Peace to Rap, no, rest in peace to wackness<br/>
Yeah, nigga, I whacked it<br/>
Baby boy with the glasses<br/>
Tears like a black rap Zach Galifianakis<br/>
Hangover, game over, nigga that's it
