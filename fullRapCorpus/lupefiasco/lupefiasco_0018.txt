They tryin' to censor the influencer<br/>
Just makes me sicker, influenza, (yeah)<br/>
I'll abide by the censorship,<br/>
Soon as they ride I'll get back on my nigga shit,<br/>
Can't reverse <i>[song lyrics reversed]</i><br/>
The boy-game Advanced, complete the genesis,<br/>
I've broke bread with societies menaces,<br/>
I've dedicated sentences to the dead, and said hold your heads to my niggas doin' sentences,<br/>
I send condolences to the victims but, threats two the witnesses, (Ugh)<br/>
On my path I was facing a paragraph, Myself,<br/>
So they sentiments is felt,<br/>
When you hate your own and discriminate of self,<br/>
In a cell gotta make your home, cause you might never make it home,<br/>
Suicide on your side might commit it with your belt,<br/>
Keep your pants on homie, (uh)<br/>
Streets are damn so lonely, like only,<br/>
A bunch of niggas won't help (nah),<br/>
That's the enemy of stealth,<br/>
Plus if they get caught how you gonna keep your heart fatigue,<br/>
The hustler's diet is the enemy of health, give you heart disease (uh),<br/>
Arteries hard but it's hard to leave the bread alone,<br/>
Aren't we hard headed, headed for harm, but don't threat it homes,<br/>
From the twist tied to the butt,<br/>
We be rippin' it up<br/>
From the horror to the cure, don't force the issue,<br/>
To you my niggas in the war, may the force be with you (like uh)
