God is great!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ghettos, America. U.S. to the izzay<br/>
Killa in the citywide sprizzay<br/>
Where there's sunshine in the shizzade<br/>
Church won't pull him out the pin like a grenade<br/>
For acting out their fears like a charade<br/>
'Til they blackin' out their tears like it's lights out<br/>
Bring em out the black like a lighthouse<br/>
And wave to em before they wiped out<br/>
Lifesaver, threw em, hope they catch it<br/>
But it's so Titanic to be iced out<br/>
That's just scratching the surface like triple axels<br/>
Want to roll around that Bentley like Crystal Castles<br/>
In addition to the chain<br/>
That's just to take the attention from the pain<br/>
Or is it the mission of the man<br/>
Audubon Ballroom, Motel Lorraine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now white people, they can't say nigga<br/>
So I gotta take it back<br/>
Now black people, we're not niggas<br/>
God made us better than that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
No break, ah wait<br/>
Little mayhem for your All-State, nay ham, all steak<br/>
Get a good ball great like a golf grade<br/>
Make the ball break<br/>
Just one swing, no putting<br/>
That's how I try 'n does things always<br/>
Especially when your past is<br/>
Martin, Baldwin, Audubon Ballroom<br/>
Turn the glass ceiling to a glass floor<br/>
Make a trampoline out of trapdoor<br/>
On that gasoline when I was back poor<br/>
Now they crafted out my dream underneath a tap floor<br/>
Backpack battle-cat underground rap lore<br/>
Anonymous but dominant - what's a Mac to a hacker<br/>
In other words, lyrical Zuckerbergs<br/>
Pimp you may move a mouse but what's a rat to a cat store<br/>
It's like a gig to an app store<br/>
I rap Black history, you can only see my past if you fast forward<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now white people, they can't say nigga<br/>
So I gotta take it back<br/>
Now black people, we're not niggas<br/>
God made us better than that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Black Panthers, black anthems, black blues<br/>
With black answers for black stanzas: Langston Hughes<br/>
Breaking rules, ain't it cool?<br/>
Took it old, and made it new<br/>
Black painters, musical black anger<br/>
Black mothers, beautiful black anchors<br/>
So let's hear it for 'em! Let's hear it for 'em!<br/>
Let's hear it for 'em! Let's hear it for 'em!<br/>
Black America! Trap America!<br/>
80s Babies! Crack America!<br/>
Rap America! Bad as Erykah!<br/>
From the era of family tearing up<br/>
But we just won big, can't be undid<br/>
Form a whole culture in just one kid<br/>
Miami dope boys, Oakland militants<br/>
Harlem Renaissance it's our deliverance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now white people, they can't say nigga<br/>
So I gotta take it back<br/>
Now black people, we're not niggas<br/>
God made us better than that
