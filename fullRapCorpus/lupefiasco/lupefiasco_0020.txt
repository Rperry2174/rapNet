Uh, momma raised a trooper<br/>
They trynna hit me in my head like Koopa<br/>
But I move like Super<br/>
With the hood on my shoulder like Bazookas, early<br/>
I'm waking up the roosters<br/>
Until they late, and they waking up the future<br/>
And send me to the great wise<br/>
In a suit or, something looser<br/>
You see, I grew up around rootas of the tootas<br/>
I rephrase<br/>
I mean supporters of the snortas, I retraces<br/>
Become recorder of the corner, free base<br/>
Or the shooter<br/>
I set Madison on fire, like the looters in '92<br/>
Cooler, much more mature<br/>
You can pick it up off the floor like Hoovers<br/>
A newcomer, locin' with 2 numbers<br/>
The holidays of the hustlers<br/>
I be a Huckleberry Doc Holiday with the peacemaker<br/>
F-N-F Upwards<br/>
I'm coming<br/>
'bout my money shot like West Coast productions<br/>
But I'm Chicago born &amp; raised, formed &amp; made<br/>
Company's coming, please inform your maids<br/>
First and!!! <i>[Gunshot]</i>
