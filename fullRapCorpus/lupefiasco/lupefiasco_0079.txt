<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm not a turtle, Imma turbo<br/>
Haters pray to god that I turn slow<br/>
Like I’m sipping on purple<br/>
But I ain’t on your globe<br/>
I’m in a whole ‘nother circle<br/>
Trying to keep it clean like church clothes<br/>
Said that respect was something had to work for<br/>
But that ain’t gonna work though<br/>
Get your respect, but lose all my worth, no<br/>
You can get that, get a hearse, go<br/>
Don’t leave 48 you’ll find a killer in the first floor<br/>
It was me boy, to commercials<br/>
Feeling out of place like PETA at a fur store<br/>
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats<br/>
Said I could never break away from your hold<br/>
Watch me, turn though<br/>
Said that I blew it like Turquoise<br/>
Just mad hear it all in your word choice<br/>
Know it hurts but I really don’t care though<br/>
Let me rub it in, get it all up in that ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I can see the morning creeping up on us<br/>
It’s like the world’s in my hands now<br/>
I’m feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me<br/>
I don’t wanna care right now<br/>
I don’t wanna care right now<br/>
No I really don’t, really don’t, wanna care right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Oh-oh Go-Go-God over everything-thing<br/>
You fly but stars over everything-thing<br/>
And I’m one of them, yeah one of th-the-them<br/>
Oh I’m not o-o-one? Well I’m a hundred th-the-then<br/>
I’m a hundred mother loving stars<br/>
You’re no lights, you’re an undercover car<br/>
I’m an ambulance, and a fire truck, and some strobe lights, tied up!<br/>
Shining all in your eyes, all out of yours and all into mine<br/>
Lights and stars is all intertwined<br/>
And I’m feeling like Malcolm looking all out the blinds<br/>
Any means any means, and you can do anything anything<br/>
And the flow tight, skinny jeans skinny jeans<br/>
Hit you like Pacquiao, Philippines Philippines<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Ya’ll know I'm the little homie Lupe, yes sir, who they<br/>
They yester, and I’m today, and tomorrow, hooray<br/>
Can I get a hip-hip for the new K-I-N-G, nigga I-AM-HE<br/>
Got the game in the clutch like I am G<br/>
You ball little boy, But I N-B-A<br/>
With a hand for the world, you a boy band with a dance and a twirl<br/>
I’m a rockstar with a band so thorough<br/>
Big ass tour bus that’s jammed full of girls<br/>
T-t-tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof<br/>
T-t-tell em what it do, I don’t care about your curfew<br/>
I’ll tell you when I’m through boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Tell em what it do, yell it from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy<br/>
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy<br/>
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy<br/>
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy<br/>
I don’t wanna, I-I don’t wanna, I-I-I don’t wanna<br/>
C-c-c-care right now<br/>
I don’t wanna, I-I don’t wanna, I-I-I don’t wanna<br/>
C-c-c-care right, c-c-c-care right now
