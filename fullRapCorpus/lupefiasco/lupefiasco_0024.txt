Yeah, Lupe<br/>
Commissioner, Chi-Town, F and F, collaboration<br/>
Do it like this here, that's right, that's right<br/>
Come on, yeah, come on come on<br/>
Come on come on, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Now I ain't tryin' to toot my horn but look what I'm on<br/>
Man, look what I bought here, look who I taught here<br/>
Look how I fought here, For what I sought here<br/>
For everywhere I go, though, they be throwin' salt there<br/>
But it's cool though, I'mma keep it cool Joe<br/>
I'm as cool as cool Joe<br/>
Now look at my shoes, Joe<br/>
Now look at these shoes, yo<br/>
You can't find that<br/>
Unless you flyin' to Singapore<br/>
Homie you ain't buyin' that<br/>
All I'm tryin' to do is bringin' that time back<br/>
It was written, man, bring those rhymes back<br/>
<br/>
Life after death homie, bring those lines back<br/>
Malcolm X, too tryin' to bring that shine back<br/>
It's my thing, I spit it like Sean King<br/>
It's more than just rhyming, I'm doin' 'bout nine things<br/>
The aforementioned executive board<br/>
Sittin' representin' the world famous<br/>
Grammy Award-winnin' (F&amp;F?)<br/>
That's right, homie, Grammy Award winnin'<br/>
Could have been puttin' it in your face<br/>
But that's the poor in 'em<br/>
See, what I gotta front for<br/>
Who I gotta front for<br/>
Everythin' you doin', homie, is over and done for<br/>
<br/>
But you can catch Lu chillin' in his one off's<br/>
If y'all dont know what that means, homie<br/>
Then y'all understand thats mean, homie<br/>
That means, homie, these jeans on me are only pale<br/>
After sewing machines, homie<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm just showin' you're mean, homie<br/>
Like a dictionary<br/>
Just listen clearly to the clean, homie<br/>
And this ain't fair, I'm barely on my lean, homie<br/>
I put my all like into a washing machine, homie<br/>
Double loader, you just watchin' me clean, homie<br/>
Wait til' I sod you in dirt<br/>
Oops, I spilled some 1st &amp; 15th on me<br/>
And that stained Maine<br/>
You can try Canada Dry<br/>
Or you can try pouring Oxy Clean on me<br/>
Homie, it won't work clean<br/>
Chicken head resistant<br/>
Lady, you can't curse<br/>
God willin', we got the album comin' out, though<br/>
Ha ha, church
