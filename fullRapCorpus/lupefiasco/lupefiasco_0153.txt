<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Through the fire, smoke, and broken rubble<br/>
Walks the secret life, bullet-proof and bulging muscle<br/>
Death-defying, highest flying over trouble<br/>
Can you please come and help us out our hopeless struggles<br/>
Sympathy is wearing off and dying out<br/>
In the face of all these enemies and crying out<br/>
Losing all this energy from finding out<br/>
The world is filled with ills, ever so close to timing out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Where, are those heroes<br/>
Where, are those super-heroes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Pondering, that super-villain’s got a point<br/>
Told the captain on the roof while they was smoking joints<br/>
Flicked the ashes down into the street below<br/>
Looked up, said he hate the city now, even though<br/>
He swore that he’d protect it when he landed<br/>
Their perspective’s now changed, all pretty much abandoned<br/>
The captain spray cologne around and said he understand it<br/>
It’s getting hard to separate the saints from the satanic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Last remarks, they did it to themselves<br/>
I killed off heaven, now I live in hell<br/>
So complicit and they all non-survival<br/>
Told them that they biggest rival is inside you<br/>
I do possess the power to revive you<br/>
But if I did that, I’d just have to fight you<br/>
Cause you truly are the hero and the villain<br/>
The world stood froze, hearing a truth so chilling<br/>
Reporters start filming, somebody shouted, “Kill him!”<br/>
He looked back in disgust and flew up to the ceiling<br/>
Busted through the roof and kicked over the building<br/>
Before it hit the ground, a younger hero flew around<br/>
And put it on his shoulders, said you’re naive now<br/>
But believe, you’ll believe me when you’re older<br/>
Every asteroid you stop and bomb you fly up into space<br/>
You ain’t saving them from danger, you’re keeping danger safe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
