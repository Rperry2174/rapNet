<i>[Lupe Deep Voice]</i><br/>
Little Terry got a gun, he got from the store,<br/>
He bought it with the money he got from his chores,<br/>
He robbed candy shop told her lay down on the floor,<br/>
Put the cookies in his bag took the pennies out the drawer.<br/>
<br/>
Little Kalil got a gun he got from the rebels,<br/>
To kill the infidels and American devils,<br/>
A bomb on his waist,<br/>
A mask on his face,<br/>
Prays five times a day,<br/>
And listens to Heavy Metal.<br/>
<br/>
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad,<br/>
That he snuck into school in his black book bag,<br/>
His black nail polish, black boots and black hair,<br/>
He's gonna blow away the bully that just pushed his ass...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
I killed another man today,<br/>
Shot him in his back as he ran away,<br/>
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade,<br/>
Cut his wife's throat as she put her hands to pray,<br/>
Just five more dawgs then we can get a soccer ball,<br/>
That's what my commander say,<br/>
How Old?<br/>
Well I'm like ten, eleven, been fighting since I was like six or seven,<br/>
Now I don't know much about where I'm from but I know I strike fear everywhere I come,<br/>
Government want me dead so I wear my gun, I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young,<br/>
This candy give me courage not to fear no one,<br/>
To fear no pain, and hear no tongue,<br/>
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear,<br/>
If I'm in your dreams then your end is near.<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nikki Jean]</i><br/>
Little Weapon,<br/>
Little Weapon,<br/>
Little Weapon<br/>
We're calling you<br/>
There's a war<br/>
if the guns are just too tall for you<br/>
We'll find you something small to use<br/>
Little Weapon, Little Weapon, Little Weapon<br/>
We need you now, pow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Now here comes the march of the boy brigade<br/>
A macabre Parade of the toys he made<br/>
And in Shimmer shades who looks half his age<br/>
About half the size of the flags they waved<br/>
And Camouflage suits that made to fit youths<br/>
'cause the ones of the dead soldiers hang a little loose<br/>
And AK-47's that they shooting into heaven<br/>
Like they're trying to kill the Jetson's<br/>
They struggle little recruits<br/>
Cute Smileless, Heartless, violent<br/>
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways,<br/>
Can't write their own names or read the words on their own graves<br/>
Think you gangster popped a few rounds,<br/>
These kids will come through and murder a whole town,<br/>
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down,<br/>
The grave gets deeper the further we go down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bishop G]</i><br/>
Imagine if I had to console,<br/>
The family of those slain,<br/>
I slain on game consoles,<br/>
I aim I hold, right trigger to squeeze,<br/>
press up and Y one less nigga breathe,<br/>
B for the Bombs press pause for your moms,<br/>
Make the room silent, she don't approve of violent games,<br/>
She leaves resume activity,<br/>
Start and blew hearts with poor harsh wizardry,<br/>
On next part I insert code<br/>
To sweeten up the little person' murder workload<br/>
I tell him he work for<br/>
CIA with A<br/>
A operative, I operate this game all day<br/>
I hold a controller connected to the soldier<br/>
With weapons on his shoulder he's only seconds older than me<br/>
We playful but serious, now keep that on mind<br/>
for on line experience<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
