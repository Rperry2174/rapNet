<i>[Howard Zinn:]</i><br/>
We have to stop wars, we have to stop this war<br/>
And we have to get out the habit of war<br/>
It's more than a habit, it's an addiction<br/>
We have to get out of thinking that we must be a military superpower<br/>
<br/>
We must get out of thinking that we must have military bases, as we have in a hundred countries<br/>
Is it possible that having military bases in a hundred countries arouses a lot of antagonism?<br/>
Is it possible that it promotes terrorism when your soldiers and your sailors are all over the world, occupying this country and that? Is it possible?<br/>
<br/>
Why do we have to be a military superpower?<br/>
Why can't we be a humanitarian superpower?<br/>
Instead of sending planes for bombs<br/>
Why don't we send planes for food and medicine?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soldier:]</i><br/>
Oh shit, it's one of the machines<br/>
Looks like it's trapped under something, it's broken or something<br/>
Hold on lemme get my keyboard, I can re-program this thing<br/>
No seriously, I can do it - just give me a second!<br/>
I swear to God I can do this, man, I can do this!<br/>
You have to work!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Computer:]</i><br/>
Reprogramming unsuccessful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Machine - continuously:]</i><br/>
I kill people<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soldier:]</i><br/>
All right, this is the last time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Computer:]</i><br/>
Reprogramming successful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soldier:]</i><br/>
Yes!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Machine:]</i><br/>
Fight... evil...
