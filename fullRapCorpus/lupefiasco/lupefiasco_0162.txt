<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
I got that killer shit, I got that killer shit<br/>
Killer shit<br/>
Villainous hero don't give a shit<br/>
Hancock, Will Smith<br/>
Adrenaline, with a twist<br/>
Take pride that I'm so Chi<br/>
These young bucks just a nuisance<br/>
To my sidekicks<br/>
This shit here like magic<br/>
Yeah, this here like magic<br/>
Abracadabra: rabbits<br/>
No hook but so hooked<br/>
Take a crack at my habits<br/>
Neutron but too bomb<br/>
Did it all with no tablets<br/>
It's a write off if it costs right<br/>
Get your light blue<br/>
Then the off white<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
I ain’t fucking with you come on, noooo<br/>
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it<br/>
Get it, get it, get it<br/>
Make me lose my mind girl<br/>
I can see it, I ain’t fucking with you<br/>
Come on, noooo, yeah-eh<br/>
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it<br/>
Get it - bang, bang, bang<br/>
Fuck me real good tell me that you'll never let me go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
No fares, dope fiends<br/>
Don't try that nose sting<br/>
Police rushed in<br/>
And they red lights, they got rocks and<br/>
Code D, codeine<br/>
On that James Dean, call it James Dean<br/>
Say watch that, watch that<br/>
You might die driving the same thing<br/>
Same thing, same thing, whoop whoop - see that shit?<br/>
Triple entendre no accident<br/>
Might crash trying to catch this shit<br/>
Contact if you catch a whiff<br/>
All contact that I catch adrift<br/>
That I kick-block, then stop, on ken dot<br/>
Trying to stack of bricks<br/>
Like 10 rocks crush it up and don't touch it up<br/>
While you uppercut<br/>
Shoryuken fuck it up<br/>
Nigga let 'em hit it raw<br/>
Send it through your system through a car antenna<br/>
<i>[?]</i> with a glass dick up in her jaw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
I ain’t fucking with you come on, noooo<br/>
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it<br/>
Get it, get it, get it<br/>
Make me lose my mind girl<br/>
I can see it, I ain’t fucking with you<br/>
Come on, noooo, yeah-eh<br/>
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it<br/>
Get it - bang, bang, bang<br/>
Fuck me real good tell me that you'll never let me go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Higher from the back, fire from the top<br/>
Fire to the buyer to the tryer of the rock<br/>
Supplier to the buyer to the driver of the drop<br/>
Lighter to the higher, to the writer to the cops<br/>
Lighter to the pipe or set fire to the crops<br/>
Freebase crack rock<br/>
Supply it worldwide when they fire at the box<br/>
Police raid, trap hot<br/>
Police state, black plot<br/>
Drier than the fire so theres violence a lot<br/>
Price is going higher so they're firing the shots<br/>
Die or don't survive, it's survival of the block<br/>
That's your girl, I could X that, by any means, I get it clean<br/>
One last hit, and that's it, she won't act it, can't intervene<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
I ain’t fucking with you come on, noooo<br/>
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it<br/>
Get it, get it, get it<br/>
Make me lose my mind girl<br/>
I can see it, I ain’t fucking with you<br/>
Come on, noooo, yeah-eh<br/>
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it<br/>
Get it - bang, bang, bang<br/>
Fuck me real good tell me that you'll never let me go
