<i>[Pre-Hook: Troi]</i><br/>
Closet full of bones<br/>
Just don't try to put'em back together<br/>
(Try to put'em back together)<br/>
And I'll just bite my tongue<br/>
So wear it like a scarlet letter<br/>
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
(I've always loved you)<br/>
Quiet in the court for the courtship<br/>
Marriage of the dork and the gorgeous<br/>
Took her from the king of the corpses<br/>
He revolve jumped off the wall of the fort with the horses<br/>
This is foretold, Bojangles was tapping in morse code<br/>
At least to the mad man genius, tap top secrets and more gold<br/>
(All of you)<br/>
From the guts of the mother, can push or move her undercover<br/>
With a $3,000 son she just want a lover<br/>
And somebody else to come and try and drug her<br/>
Take her off the grill, she done<br/>
Pills celebrating, "we won"<br/>
In the system of the women, never knew he had it in him<br/>
This condition when the world that they make him become<br/>
Cocaine and new high tech way smuggle whole things<br/>
(I've always loved you)<br/>
From the control range that make radio heads with gold brains<br/>
(All of you)<br/>
Depart 84' Jags on gold chains<br/>
Developing niggas from a whole name<br/>
God is great, but it's snakes on my soul plane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook: Troi]</i><br/>
Closet full of bones<br/>
Just don't try to put'em back together<br/>
(Try to put'em back together)<br/>
And I'll just bite my tongue<br/>
So wear it like a scarlet letter<br/>
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Troi]</i><br/>
Anatomy (skin), will be the death of me<br/>
Anatomy (skin), that's just my anatomy<br/>
Anatomy (skin), will be the death of me<br/>
Anatomy (skin)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
(Tell me what to do)<br/>
Limo to the limit, fill it till the brim get in it<br/>
You can't get it, if you gotta ask<br/>
(Make me pretty)<br/>
In that case I want two masks<br/>
Bottom class, dollar cast<br/>
Poppin' tags, droppin' trash in shopping bags<br/>
Till Akeem take our pocket cash<br/>
(Am I beautiful?)<br/>
Write it in lights, molly in the body of Christ<br/>
Drop me to the lobby from heights<br/>
Then over the threshold to redeem the doorway<br/>
Fourteen broads like the king of Norway<br/>
Fourteen broads having dreams of foreplay<br/>
Fourteen arm Shiva (viva la coup!)<br/>
If the government get it I'm a fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook: Troi]</i><br/>
Closet full of bones<br/>
Just don't try to put'em back together<br/>
(Try to put'em back together)<br/>
And I'll just bite my tongue<br/>
So wear it like a scarlet letter<br/>
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Troi]</i><br/>
Anatomy (skin), will be the death of me<br/>
Anatomy (skin), that's just my anatomy<br/>
Anatomy (skin), will be the death of me<br/>
Anatomy (skin)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Sanskrit dance on the page of the dead book<br/>
Don't leave the restroom with the left foot<br/>
Flags of Tibet, to bet, to bed, to death, flesh<br/>
Release the leash on a fast car<br/>
Feed on the keys, fall asleep in a Jaguar<br/>
The tip of thy sword is white<br/>
Am I night, am I black, am I light?<br/>
Have I been this?<br/>
Realize my begin when I find where my end this<br/>
Oedipus wrecks, motherfucker this better than sex<br/>
Material potion the love of my martyr<br/>
Currency soaked in the blood of my father<br/>
(Will you cry for me?)<br/>
Sky burial, let the wind carry you, farther<br/>
Than I could<br/>
(live forever)<br/>
An anatomy, not of me, knotting me to it, nodding me to it<br/>
Eyes of the I and others, watching me do it<br/>
Adapt in each rubric<br/>
Kubrick in plot and tone<br/>
Lots of bones, scolds to the top of tone<br/>
Skim through it is just skin to it<br/>
You're so thin you see the sins through it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook: Troi]</i><br/>
Closet full of bones<br/>
Just don't try to put'em back together<br/>
(Try to put'em back together)<br/>
And I'll just bite my tongue<br/>
So wear it like a scarlet letter<br/>
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Troi]</i><br/>
Anatomy (skin), will be the death of me<br/>
Anatomy (skin), that's just my anatomy<br/>
Anatomy (skin), will be the death of me<br/>
Anatomy (skin)
