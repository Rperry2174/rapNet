You live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
How bout them bullets ain't slow you up<br/>
You ain't really die and we watched you grow up<br/>
At twelve months you took ya first steps<br/>
Awkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best<br/>
Your first breaths that we can call words<br/>
In ya fathers lap on November 23rd<br/>
And They were "live for me" and he did for you<br/>
Flipped to neutron and stayed inside the crib for you<br/>
And this commitment from ya father imparted a deep sense of value you'd forever harbor<br/>
And we were all so proud as we seen you gettin' smarter<br/>
And the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter<br/>
Cause you were not a martyr<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
At six you started reading whole books<br/>
At seven you knew how a brain looked<br/>
And could roughly describe all the different regions<br/>
Could tell when we were sick and even knew the reason<br/>
The world wasn't at peace<br/>
Gunfire every weekend<br/>
But you were hardly there<br/>
Cause you was always leaving<br/>
Field museum planetarium aquarium<br/>
You saw something special in that tank you were starin' in<br/>
And in those moments as a little girl you realized it was a bigger world<br/>
Bigger than the southside<br/>
Bigger than Chicago<br/>
And you were bigger but still wanted on rims on ya car though<br/>
And big ass woofers in ya car door<br/>
So you could wang like ya daddy at the park eating sharks<br/>
Went to King where you were teased for being smart<br/>
Where you bumped into Hadiya teaching art.<br/>
You Live forever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
At sixteen is when you got you scholarship<br/>
At twenty-two is when you got ya doctorate<br/>
Even now it's kinda hard to believe<br/>
But ya father taught you work hard and achieve<br/>
And you complied<br/>
Accepted by every medical school you applied<br/>
But the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot you replied<br/>
"They need me in the hood" and that's where you reside<br/>
Free clinic, nobody denied<br/>
And that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside<br/>
And saw a man and van and a bleeding baby in his hands<br/>
Fading fast but you knew she could survive<br/>
Did everything you could to keep this girl alive<br/>
Stabilized until the ambulance arrived<br/>
And In that moment where you gave your help, bet you didn't know that you saved yourself<br/>
<br/>
You live forever<br/>
Lord have mercy
