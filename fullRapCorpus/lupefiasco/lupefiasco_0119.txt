We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals<br/>
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm<br/>
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn<br/>
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn<br/>
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'<br/>
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy<br/>
So what powers cowards to get them to the top<br/>
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?<br/>
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop<br/>
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock<br/>
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading<br/>
They catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings<br/>
<br/>
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?<br/>
And what's the talking without the match feeling?<br/>
As buried living and cherry picking<br/>
Every linen from your berry system<br/>
Then proceed with the pack feeding<br/>
When I was young I had visions of another world<br/>
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HuRl<br/>
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls<br/>
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls<br/>
I like my pancakes cut in swirls<br/>
Morrocan moles and undercover squirrels<br/>
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons<br/>
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms<br/>
Apologise for my weird mix<br/>
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips<br/>
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks<br/>
And smells like shotguns and deer piss<br/>
They on their hunt, kinda salty that I'm going hard<br/>
First part of a party, that I throw in parts<br/>
One minute you playing pool, next minute you throwing darts<br/>
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars<br/>
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards<br/>
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts<br/>
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes<br/>
Nerd game make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake<br/>
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes<br/>
Backup the word play playin' at the man's states<br/>
Mean I can still be the man if the dam breaks<br/>
And when the man brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face<br/>
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base<br/>
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine<br/>
That hovers above cities like weather men<br/>
And maybe weather woman<br/>
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'<br/>
I prefer girls to reign all over the world<br/>
<br/>
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance<br/>
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining<br/>
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man<br/>
But reign like Queens that reign over made man<br/>
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen<br/>
But Queen like white glove wave hand<br/>
And not wave hand like it's a heat wave<br/>
So you make a fan by waving your hand<br/>
I'm talking wave like you saying "hey"<br/>
Man, and not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless<br/>
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress<br/>
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements<br/>
And especially when you're recording<br/>
Cause that's the portion that's important<br/>
When I was reporting that I was poor<br/>
But now I'm more than<br/>
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots<br/>
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops<br/>
Deep plots in floor, the ceiling windows for my peep pots<br/>
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop<br/>
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop<br/>
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box<br/>
So the sun rise when the beat drops<br/>
And the sun dies when the beat stops...<br/>
Then it unties, then it relocks<br/>
Then it relapsed, then it detox<br/>
Then heat back like a heat pack<br/>
On his knee caps of the weak spot<br/>
Cause he want what we got, like yeah<br/>
<br/>
Then forge poetry like a young honory Morrissey<br/>
Then spit it to the golden locks thots<br/>
Who like their porridge all watery<br/>
Not scorching nor sorbity<br/>
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery<br/>
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall<br/>
A more torturing, a water boarding Barbie doll<br/>
A river of women like a Brazilian Carnival<br/>
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol<br/>
Somebody give them the volleyballs<br/>
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's<br/>
Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws<br/>
Coming out the closet over goblets down at Madri Gras<br/>
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call<br/>
My reposition was black condition of activism<br/>
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems<br/>
But they not after listens, unless it's dropping on Activision<br/>
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions<br/>
Operating applications, stuck inside a Apple prison<br/>
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion<br/>
<br/>
Or are we more... than soil tainting, disloyal changelings<br/>
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing<br/>
And foiling other's royal saintings?<br/>
I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings<br/>
Uhhh!<br/>
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it<br/>
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest<br/>
Believe all that unless you Jewish<br/>
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus<br/>
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris<br/>
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change<br/>
My chair position or conditions of my porridge<br/>
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus<br/>
Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfuckin' forest<br/>
<br/>
As I perform a nerve storm<br/>
I prefer my pictures in word form<br/>
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born<br/>
As I paint cold pictures like Kool-Aid facing condensation<br/>
Having conversations with flavourful combinations<br/>
Slave to my concentration<br/>
So that's OJ The Juiceman meets OJ with two hands<br/>
And two gloves, that's too snug<br/>
To judge who was, who drew blood<br/>
<br/>
And, Lupe look at all these toucans<br/>
In a cemetery full of tomahawkes<br/>
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults<br/>
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across<br/>
Anomalies by the colonies flukes by the reservoir<br/>
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor<br/>
Levitating youth so know the truth of where the fountain hides<br/>
Bucaraa Roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides<br/>
A thousands parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes<br/>
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies<br/>
Chocula Counts by the counts of 5, refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters<br/>
Incinerated shoes and the manual for contra<br/>
Assorted memories from my childhood<br/>
Absorbing energy from the wild woods<br/>
Electronic combat Konami sign contract<br/>
Chinese char killing cucarachas on contact<br/>
Chicago spread an aficionado<br/>
Efficient spitting bridging divisions is in Chicano<br/>
Whoâ€™s the Boss? If isn't Alyssa Milano<br/>
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo<br/>
Polarize envy of the older guys<br/>
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives<br/>
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well<br/>
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells<br/>
Dodging rain and catching hail<br/>
Faces need samurais to catch the L<br/>
Special research vessels made for catching whales<br/>
Fillet-a-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails<br/>
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell<br/>
Maybe hotter irons and carbon fibres that never fail<br/>
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairytale<br/>
Or maybe just a metal pail that you hit with a steel tools<br/>
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school<br/>
Just like trout jumping out they house to let they gills cool<br/>
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool<br/>
I said it feels cool to kill fools<br/>
Slipping through the cracks like when you trying to grill gruel<br/>
Take no Viking water bottle and not following pill rules<br/>
Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood<br/>
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes<br/>
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews<br/>
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your meal you<br/>
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness<br/>
Real still till he realizes his realness<br/>
Defeat Samsara achieves nirvana and brilliance
