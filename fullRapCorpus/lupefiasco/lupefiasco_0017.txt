Sittin in the back of the police car position<br/>
Your mission is forgetting and denying they existence<br/>
Thinking of different ways to keep from submitting<br/>
and continuing not tomention...like that<br/>
Grand marquee police interceptor edition<br/>
with wall so you can barely fit in<br/>
Knees is touching the front seat shifting<br/>
Cause your handcuffs is cutting your wrist and<br/>
Your wishin that he would drive faster pleeeease<br/>
But he slows the hood as he drives past the free<br/>
It's cool but you trippin' the quicker you get there<br/>
The quicker you sit there and cuffed to a bench and<br/>
They playing good cop, bad cop one of the them<br/>
pretending so you rewindyourself<br/>
To your uneasy recline in the back of the police car<br/>
hand-cuffed to the seat belt...NAW<br/>
"You ain't gotta quicken the pace"<br/>
That just give me more time to sit and erase<br/>
Alibi and aliase switch and replace<br/>
Think about then figure out an escape thank God that I'm up in the states<br/>
Cuz if I was in Russia who knows how'd they do a hustla<br/>
Waite! I ain't a hustla I'm straight<br/>
I'm damn near a busta, no laws I break<br/>
Money I never seen guns, I didn't hold<br/>
drugs I never sold calls I didn't make<br/>
Nigga this is a waste of your time and mines<br/>
"Is that uncomfortable?"...."I fine"<br/>
A case? this ain't even a fine<br/>
You ain't find nothin' homie not even a dime<br/>
Not even a don that'll drop dime on me<br/>
I know you as Don so you put a dime on me<br/>
I know thats a crime you suppossed to fight crime for me<br/>
Protect and to serve<br/>
Prosecute, correct and return to the homies<br/>
And thats gonna send direct to the curb, so you can put em back on me<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
He's sittin in the front of the police car position<br/>
His mission is bending, pinning charges on niggas even if they didn't<br/>
He's sittin in court lying, testifying against defendants LIKE THAT<br/>
And he love to choke niggas<br/>
He don't trip wit the rich he just love the broke niggas<br/>
Probably did more dirt in the street than most niggas<br/>
Even the old people don't like em, cuz of the way he approach niggas<br/>
"Nigga you ain't no better than me"<br/>
Just a hustla wit a badge confiscate the dope money<br/>
Put it wit your retirement boat money<br/>
You ain't building no playgrounds in the poor for some cash<br/>
That ain't a pension thats a shoe box stash<br/>
Wit a glock to protect it we both undercover check it<br/>
Thinking that the good we do, gonna out weigh the sinning that we do to collect it<br/>
Sayin its for the community, they don't value us<br/>
Only around because the property value up<br/>
And they gotta clean the street before they put the houses up<br/>
Knock the Section 8's down...put them 200,000's up<br/>
Feel he don't get paid enough<br/>
To kick in doors to raid and cuff<br/>
So he use what niggas get on the street to supplement the wages cut<br/>
So he gotta keep just enough niggas out there hustlin to keep his paper up<br/>
LIKE THAT!!!...Maybe he should be in the handcuffs<br/>
<br/>
