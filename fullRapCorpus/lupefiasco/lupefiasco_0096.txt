<i>[Elle Goulding]</i><br/>
I had a way then, losing it all on my own<br/>
I had a heart then but the Queen has been overthrown<br/>
And I’m not sleeping now<br/>
The dark is too hard to beat<br/>
And I’m not keeping up the strength I need to push me<br/>
You sure the lights don’t stop me<br/>
Turn to stone shining when I’m alone<br/>
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong<br/>
Dreaming when they’re gone<br/>
Cause they’re calling, calling, calling<br/>
Calling, calling, calling<br/>
You sure the lights don’t stop me<br/>
Turn to stone shining when I’m alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
So, what do you bunches stand for?<br/>
Dreads in the sky, I and I<br/>
2 new Vans on a Land 4<br/>
Take that back, make that 2 new shoes on a van floor<br/>
Me and my band out on that road<br/>
On a never-back-down-from-a-stance tour<br/>
Yeah, touch more souls than a dance floor<br/>
While they touch less tours than a hand or<br/>
Ceiling fan or wait, let me tell ya slower<br/>
Lift my fans up to the to the ceiling<br/>
And you’ll never touch the floor<br/>
Now if Noah need a rower, I’ll be there with my oar<br/>
Til we get back to the shore<br/>
Dad made me a soldier, GI Joe to these Cobras<br/>
Tryna FBI my panther, CIA my sankofa<br/>
Infiltrate my Carter, illuminate my culture<br/>
While they watching through that bunker<br/>
But I stay up on my hustle<br/>
Turn that belt back on theyself<br/>
Now I watch them scream for help<br/>
Like Africa need aid, or black women as maids<br/>
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubba's mothers<br/>
Take the hero out the Nino, keep it real as treble trouble huh?<br/>
Or maybe cartoon Martin on the boondocks<br/>
Flip the script on chicks who think they shit smells like perfume shops<br/>
Half them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie<br/>
She Delila with them 45 or Keisha with that Uzi<br/>
Now I know that’s contradiction, wants and needs and competition<br/>
But it’s hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition<br/>
While we waiting on that compromise, proceed with that conscious eye<br/>
New gang alert: hashtag #occupies<br/>
Repping to the death of me, FnF what’s left of me<br/>
All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling<br/>
Only time I wrestle’s when I’m wrestling with settling<br/>
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything<br/>
I know that don’t mix like ecstasy and ketamine<br/>
Funny how I’m only sick if you never catch a thing<br/>
Argue with your friends over what really the record means<br/>
Back and forth about its course, with professor’s refereeing<br/>
Why he so rebellious? Up-front with his realness?<br/>
They wanna be Fiasco’s, reproduce his failures<br/>
Emperor is his alias, but not Marcus Aurelius<br/>
This is more like Sparta: kick you down a well, kid<br/>
And on my last check, I copped that NSX just like Pharrell did<br/>
Well did, better days to come<br/>
My only promise is I’ll never ruin the young<br/>
I’ll never human and sung lyrics in a spirit that's<br/>
Super human to some, keep you pursuin’ the sun of<br/>
Slums, plus, get up outta them, plus never forget<br/>
This is where you from plus<br/>
Make sure that you ballin when you come back up in them, plus<br/>
We don’t die, multiply, every single come-up<br/>
A Rumpa-pum-pum-yup<br/>
<br/>
