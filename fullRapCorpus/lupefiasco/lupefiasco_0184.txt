<i>[Chorus - Eric Turner]</i><br/>
It’s the way of the stage it’s like a stereo sun, ohh ahh aiyy<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun<br/>
It’s the way I build up, the system﻿ really gets done, ohh ahhh aiyy<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 1]</i><br/>
I hear it, the spirit<br/>
and I don’t fear it<br/>
Matter ‘fact I steer/spear it<br/>
Right in the heart of the hardships,<br/>
I don’t veer it<br/>
And this car is just a metaphor for my experience<br/>
No registration or insurance, just a license to ill,<br/>
God’s hands on the wheel, and my pedal’s to the ceilin’, peelin’<br/>
Speedin like 24 frames through the lights,<br/>
With the traffic cameras filmin’, brights<br/>
So I could see the brilliance of this life I’ve been givin’, livin’<br/>
To start a revolution every minute<br/>
Driven’ to win it, no breaks, no pittin’<br/>
Poll position ya soul, keep ya windows tinted<br/>
So we can see out it, but they cant see in it<br/>
So this here’s ours, and them their’s rented<br/>
Cars moving at top gear, Jeremy Clarkson<br/>
I feel like this my first track and I ain’t even start nothin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Eric Turner]</i><br/>
It’s the way of the stage it’s like a stereo sun, ohh ahh aiyy<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun<br/>
It’s the way I build up, the system﻿ really gets done, ohh ahhh aiyy<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 2]</i><br/>
The sky’s on fire, the storm is almost near us<br/>
But that’s when I’m the clearest. When things are the severest<br/>
I’ll be here for its arrival and for its disappearance.<br/>
Broadcastin’ live and clear, even with the interference.<br/>
See this is what it sounds like when life becomes lyric.<br/>
The best thing ever, you should really come and hear it.<br/>
But if you cant, cool. We’ll be coming to your nearest, soon.<br/>
Shinnin’ like two suns, is better than two thumbs<br/>
The whole plot’s to get you to stop from doing what you do, to do better than you’ve done.<br/>
Then we’ll scare down the feds in the room.<br/>
Who dares not to scare? Hear it, boom!<br/>
Unaffected by your werewolves, ghosts and your ‘boo’<br/>
The tour through the tombs don’t do nuttin to ‘em.<br/>
Neva’<br/>
I turn the pressure into treasure.<br/>
My problem’s in the presents<br/>
And my presence is foreva’<br/>
Yes!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Eric Turner]</i><br/>
It’s the way of the stage it’s like a stereo sun, ohh ahh aiyy<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun<br/>
It’s the way I build up, the system﻿ really gets done, ohh ahhh aiyy<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
(Love, always, shines)<br/>
Like a stereo sun<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun<br/>
(Love, always, shines)<br/>
It’s the way of the stage<br/>
It’s the way of the stage<br/>
(Love, always, shines)<br/>
Like a stereo sun, ohh ahh aiyy<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun<br/>
(Love, always, shines)<br/>
Like a stereo sun<br/>
(Love, always, shines)<br/>
It’s like a stereo sun
