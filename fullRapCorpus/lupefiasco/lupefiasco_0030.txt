<i>[To the beat of Gorillaz' "Dirty Harry"]</i><br/>
<br/>
Catch me I'm balling, catch me I'm balling<br/>
Catch me like Spalding, catch me like Rawlings<br/>
If he indeed the MC<br/>
Invite him in/vitamin like GNC<br/>
Can't see me like BIG on CMT<br/>
Did a little bit of time on BMG<br/>
But this right here homie, this all me<br/>
Can you be down? Nah, nigga C.M.B.<br/>
That's cold, that ain't nice G<br/>
So what though? Little homie remind me of Ice-T<br/>
By the way we share the same birthday<br/>
The word play is work but pimping is easy<br/>
So catch me I'm balling<br/>
I'm sick too if you ain't catch me like coughing<br/>
Back when I said you should catch me like Rawlings<br/>
It's cool, cause most cats that I bump into can't catch me that often<br/>
Most times they just end up falling<br/>
Ball for a few then end up walking<br/>
Catch me in the ball with a Cinderella waltzing<br/>
And I do it until it's no longer exclusive<br/>
Might go once, might go twice<br/>
But never three times like an auction to it<br/>
See I, walk into it, I do my thang<br/>
And tell a homie that it's cool to let y'all into it
