<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Your attention please, your attention I need it<br/>
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it<br/>
Where I'm seated is scenic<br/>
Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic<br/>
Which means you somewhere in between it<br/>
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas<br/>
I'm in the market for low-mile 360 Modenas<br/>
And a good organic cleaners<br/>
My car always a winner<br/>
Your car's always pitted<br/>
We should call it Stanley Steamers<br/>
Most of my friends in gangs<br/>
My new nickname is gang is con/Ghengis Khan<br/>
But without the 'Ye, but his last name's my side<br/>
I ride with the demeanors/the meanest<br/>
I'm armed to the teeth<br/>
You're Venus and you've never been to the Dinas/dentist)<br/>
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it<br/>
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus<br/>
I donate to the campus and my name's on the arenas<br/>
But you can't bring it to my court not even with subpoenas<br/>
Cause you can't play my sport but you can still cheerlead us<br/>
And you can't sit there, that section's for the seniors<br/>
And the sexy senoritas so just move up to the bleachers<br/>
How you going to school me when I grew up with your teachers<br/>
I know that you can't hear me<br/>
Cause I blew up all the speakers<br/>
And the power line is hanging<br/>
Cause I threw up all the sneakers<br/>
I ate up the imposters/pasta<br/>
And I chewed through all the pizzas<br/>
I blacked out with a black card<br/>
And I maxed out all the Visas<br/>
Accreditation so prestigious<br/>
Just walk across my stage<br/>
Your life will be completed<br/>
Don't need financial aid<br/>
Cause this is just some free shit<br/>
You been properly prepared<br/>
Throw your hats up in the air<br/>
I'm red hot, Chilly/Red Hot Chili, I'm Anthony Kiedis<br/>
My spirit smells teenage<br/>
And Chi-town's feeling excellent<br/>
We hit them with the President<br/>
See we set the precedent<br/>
I don't feel I'm best<br/>
I just feel I'm better than<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Thom Yorke/Radiohead]</i><br/>
Everyone, everyone around here<br/>
Everyone is so near<br/>
So alone, so alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
See I don't disagree<br/>
This is just a grievance<br/>
This ain't dissing<br/>
This is civil disobedience<br/>
How you going to make hip-hop<br/>
Without all the ingredients?<br/>
Lot of mouths to feed<br/>
Plus a lot of greediness<br/>
And that greed, outshines the neediness<br/>
What niggas need is some question they authority<br/>
And tune out all the TV shit<br/>
And we be this<br/>
So I give them more<br/>
You see I did it for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Yeah, I am back up on the airwaves<br/>
Feeling like a Soldier and I ain't talking where the Bears play<br/>
Flair, look how I Fred Astaire down the staircases<br/>
Fixing to be a hair-raising tortoise versus hare race<br/>
So you should hang around here/hair like some earrings<br/>
I know attention's all about how you pair things<br/>
So when I want them to hear me out<br/>
I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out<br/>
And what's written on her titties is what it's really about<br/>
Then her vagina is some poor kids from China<br/>
Nipples nuclear missiles<br/>
Ass is a daughter without a dad<br/>
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq<br/>
Health care hair, drive-by thighs<br/>
Education lips, HIV eyes<br/>
Environment feet<br/>
Justice get her so wet, brains get you brains<br/>
You can fuck her if you protest<br/>
But before you bust in her face, finish listening to the tape<br/>
Enemy of the State
