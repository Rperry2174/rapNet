My mind state rewinds wakes<br/>
And fast forwards bullets making a b-line for my face<br/>
Then they stop like Neo, laugh at me<br/>
Throw some cash at me, then fly past me<br/>
<br/>
But one ricochets off the wall to come back and ask me<br/>
Am I scared of him, or the nigga that blast me<br/>
Maybe just the hammer<br/>
That goes to be a hole in an innocent bystander<br/>
<br/>
My eye's a camera, my ear's a microphone<br/>
And my mind is Pro-Tools, my head is a stool<br/>
What's recorded in my dome gets reported when I zone<br/>
<br/>
My mouth is a speaker, I'm anchoring the misery<br/>
There's no friends, the enemy of the enemy is my enemy<br/>
Beakers and test tubes full of memories<br/>
In my laboratory, I create stories<br/>
Doze off, and wake up, surrounded by forties<br/>
<br/>
With Glocks tucked in their labels<br/>
And the caps is baseball hats, playing poker at a table<br/>
Cigarettes massage they shoulders and belly tops<br/>
Showing they navels, the dime sack side bets me<br/>
<br/>
A tec is running for president<br/>
Jesus pieces walk around with niggas hanging from they necks<br/>
Monopoly's playing chess<br/>
I just picked up an obituary of a bullet proof vest<br/>
<br/>
Put the headphones on my mouth, speak into my ears<br/>
Microphone check, check, check, check, check, check<br/>
A pair of Air Forces told me rims been extinct for years<br/>
Been ethnic cleansed by jerseys trying to take over the set<br/>
<br/>
And television's on death row for killing BET<br/>
And MTV over a dice game<br/>
And paralyzing CNN by knifing him in the neck<br/>
I hear Clear Channel's been fighting him in the rec<br/>
<br/>
He's in for giving grape Kool-Aid laced with strychnine<br/>
To mixtapes and armed robbing cassettes<br/>
Dope told me weed was a crack fiend<br/>
Crack told me that dope was a base head<br/>
Hi-hats told the police he was just a soldier<br/>
He did what the bass said<br/>
<br/>
The snare and the kick didn't make it out alive<br/>
The sample made it out with some money<br/>
But he died in the ride<br/>
The 808 got caught with some work<br/>
He ain't never coming home, so the MPC<br/>
And the MP3's is fighting over his turf<br/>
<br/>
Chandon just gave birth, but she thinking<br/>
About leaving it on the doorstep of a church<br/>
Cristal can't have kids, she plotting a kidnapping<br/>
That she orchestrated with a purse<br/>
But Gucci told Fendi, Fendi turned around and told Henny<br/>
And Henny is Moet's baby's father<br/>
But she tried it anyway, disguised as a nurse<br/>
<br/>
In the newspapers, it says hip hop called rock 'n' roll racist<br/>
Six raped the five, and the Maybach taped it<br/>
A hundred dollar bill just signed a record deal<br/>
But he blew all his money on a bracelet<br/>
And giving the gold dollar a facelift<br/>
<br/>
A button up just drove by in a 6-4 Impala<br/>
And all the Rolexes is hating, you see the smirks on they faces<br/>
The Hav-A-Tampas is defending the Dutches<br/>
They keep catching cases<br/>
<br/>
But the judge is a Swisher<br/>
He just gives him I-bonds and community service with the papers<br/>
So the Newports get mad at the Zig-Zags<br/>
Then out come the razors, see the Kools is killers on the creep<br/>
Rush up on a Philly, leave his guts spilling on the street<br/>
<br/>
Some gold grills burned down the building of some teeth<br/>
Some sharpened toothbrushes is holding a trampoline<br/>
Caught some children from the leap<br/>
I just seen Rocawear rock Sean John to sleep<br/>
<br/>
With the same heat that Baby Phat carried<br/>
Sprint was pimping Nextel, she just gave head to a BlackBerry<br/>
I heard she goes two ways but he was skeeting in her face<br/>
As it was beeping on my waist<br/>
<br/>
This is the mind of Lupe<br/>
Just make sure my mic's on<br/>
When I twilight zone, zone, zone<br/>
Zone, zone, zone, zone
