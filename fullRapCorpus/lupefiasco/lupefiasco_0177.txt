<i>[Intro: Ed Sheeran]</i><br/>
Give me that old school love right now<br/>
You know when I hold you, you won't be alone...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Ed Sheeran]</i><br/>
As long as I'm here<br/>
As long as you love me<br/>
Give me that old school love right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school<br/>
Feeling like my second album, so cool<br/>
Chiraq summer looking so cruel<br/>
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules<br/>
Went to speak but was like never mind<br/>
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time<br/>
When I was his age and if he's ever mine<br/>
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find<br/>
Better times to think back to when it comes<br/>
And he's older in the presence of somebody young<br/>
Telling him the same things that he told me<br/>
And he reacts the same way as that OG<br/>
But it's old school, it's like '03<br/>
And this old man is my old me<br/>
Takes a long time to happen so fast<br/>
To realize that your future is somebody else's past<br/>
Wassup...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good<br/>
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood<br/>
If you don't know what, then you new school<br/>
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes<br/>
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews<br/>
Melli Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools<br/>
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L<br/>
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells<br/>
One microphone and a couple 12s<br/>
Six drum sounds and a couple bells<br/>
Is all you had to make a couple rails<br/>
And that's a trap, and if you want it (eeeeeeeh)<br/>
You have to make it like that<br/>
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?<br/>
Takes a long time to happen so fast<br/>
And realize your future is somebody else's past<br/>
Wassup...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Chiraq summer looking so cruel<br/>
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?<br/>
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube<br/>
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals<br/>
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind<br/>
If it's better with time then think in line<br/>
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis<br/>
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like<br/>
Nigga I ain't psychic<br/>
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it<br/>
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements<br/>
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance<br/>
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement<br/>
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement<br/>
And when you get it through in a manner so cool<br/>
Remember to give a little nod to the old school<br/>
Wassup...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]</i><br/>
Give me that old school love right now<br/>
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want<br/>
And give me that old school love right now<br/>
You know when I hold you, you won't be alone...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
