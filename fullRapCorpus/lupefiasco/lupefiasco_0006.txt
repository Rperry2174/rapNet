You know its hard liquor<br/>
Rock steady from the start sister<br/>
Since I stepped on the set like Godzilla<br/>
Since I stepped on the scene<br/>
It's been nothing but him hustling<br/>
Old schooling, instruction was mean<br/>
As I lean back like limbo<br/>
In 6 4's like Nintendo's, clean<br/>
Don't intervene chumps<br/>
Y'all far from the hood like limousine trunks<br/>
Man, I'm up front with the pumps<br/>
And I squeeze in the cars like a mini full of clowns<br/>
Or a coupe full of Klumps<br/>
Many put it down but<br/>
Lu from the jump been producing that crunk<br/>
Fusion, the music amusing the youth where I'm from<br/>
I'm from where you shouldn't come<br/>
OG ball, see how law override like OG call<br/>
Comp can't hold it down, they ain't fatter then me<br/>
This is no seesaw, easy<br/>
They can't see me like I'm 4 feet tall<br/>
Standing behind a 4'3" wall<br/>
Believe me I'm on the low<br/>
I do a little balling like BB<br/>
I get big like toadstools<br/>
Then I might jump into a coupe and its back to being small<br/>
I get little<br/>
The one who can't be seen like flea circus<br/>
Flees the scene like perpetrators<br/>
If you can't purchase you can still juke like work it<br/>
I will foot work like percolate<br/>
Set tripping with my usual fox, the west suburbs makes the best hustlers: Was!
