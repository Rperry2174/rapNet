<i>[Lupe: Talking]</i><br/>
Uh huh, Friend of the People!!<br/>
Yeah, I mean c'mon. What the FUCK do I gotta do?<br/>
This one for the fans here Jack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe: Hook]</i><br/>
I think I'm Malcom X, Martin Luther<br/>
Add a King, add a Junior<br/>
Some Bible verses, couple Sunnahs<br/>
An AK-47 that's a revolution!! (nigga)<br/>
Think I'm 2Pac, Bob Marley<br/>
Fela Kuti, Marcus Garvey<br/>
Them the real ones, light a lighter for 'em<br/>
Letcha know, that I'm ridin' for 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe: Verse 1]</i><br/>
Gon' gimme some, a lil' more beat<br/>
Call yo' friends around, then call the police!<br/>
Im ridin' wit my flow, it take up four seats<br/>
So I'm gon' ghost ride, but with no sheets<br/>
One man by myself, even then I'm 4 deep<br/>
Like hotel swimming pools, that's 4 feet<br/>
These niggas like the rooms, so suite(sweet)<br/>
Priceline! so cheaaap<br/>
I'm the cell phone, they the room keys<br/>
I'm some shell toes, they some shoe strings<br/>
I turn 'em off, I take 'em out<br/>
I'm Reverend Run, with the laces out<br/>
Adidas, so adios<br/>
All day I dream, like I'm comatose<br/>
That's your ship sinking, and I'm so afloat<br/>
I'm T-Pain, I'm on a boat!!!<br/>
Not the slave one, Decaprio's either<br/>
Hear the waves come, they started in the bleachers<br/>
So I'm swag surfin', the pool's getting deeper<br/>
You still sweet though, here come them room keepers<br/>
Ok I'll be the strings, you be the shoes<br/>
But guess what (what?), now they Jimmy Choo's<br/>
I wear the pants, you in the pools<br/>
Yo shit meows, my shit AWOOOOOOOOO<br/>
I got a fifth flow, call me Brother Man<br/>
Africa the set, yea that's the motherland<br/>
For that BP, I shed 50 tears<br/>
In Nigeria that oil been spillin' for like 50 years!<br/>
Fifty years! Hell naww, hell yeahhh, tryina tell ya'll<br/>
At this rate, niggas gon' lose!<br/>
Can't search for water, or grow your own food!<br/>
Tell me what's gon' happen, when them stores close<br/>
And ain't gon open up, no more<br/>
Yeah that's the realest shit<br/>
You gon' feel dat, hungers yo' enemy<br/>
But you can't kill dat!<br/>
Nigga wake up, don't join the army<br/>
Kill your own peoples, but fear Illuminatis<br/>
And they ain't even real, or are they?<br/>
But you ain't even know, because you partay<br/>
Too fuckin much, if you start to doubt<br/>
They already in yo mind, and comin' out yo mouth<br/>
Its not a trick, nigga, it's a trap<br/>
Survival of the fit, is what they aiming at<br/>
And niggas ain't fit, fat as hell!<br/>
Fat in mind, body fat, as well<br/>
Who use most the drugs? Americans!<br/>
Whats in Afghanistan? heroin!<br/>
You think thats by mistake? They can't stop dat?<br/>
Don't think you safe though, because you not black<br/>
Greed is colorblind, so I'm colorblind<br/>
They gon' fuck with yours soon as they done with mine<br/>
They say I try to hard, verses overwhelm<br/>
I learned most of this, from niggas sittin' in jail<br/>
Where you think I'm from? I'm from the streets nigga!<br/>
Triple OG's told me to teach nigga!<br/>
And that ain't made up, nope! Thats a fact<br/>
They say that gangsta shit, is the shit I rap<br/>
Look who I attract, look at my inner circle<br/>
Bunch of street niggas, and a couple Erkles<br/>
Look at my fanbase! Oh yess!<br/>
Fuck what Pro say! Look at this protest!<br/>
Where they do that at? Who they do that for?<br/>
Must mean I'm doin' bad, and things is movin' slow<br/>
We talkin' revolution on public radio!<br/>
Then catch me down in Houston, sittin on them 84's<br/>
Trae wassup, ABN, gotcha back nigga, sink or swim<br/>
Free Chilly Chill, shake off yo' mastas<br/>
Pray to God; Build yo mind faster<br/>
<br/>

If you ain't know, I'm ridin' for 'em
