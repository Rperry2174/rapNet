<i>[Skylar Grey]</i><br/>
It’s so loud Inside my head<br/>
With words that I should have said!<br/>
As I drown in my regrets<br/>
I can’t take back the words I never said<br/>
I can’t take back the words I never said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit<br/>
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets<br/>
How much money does it take to really make a full clip<br/>
9/11 building 7 did they really pull it<br/>
Uhh, And a bunch of other cover ups<br/>
Your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts<br/>
If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut<br/>
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up<br/>
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the uppercrust<br/>
You get it then they move it so you never keeping up enough<br/>
If you turn on TV all you see’s a bunch of “what the fucks”<br/>
Dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such<br/>
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie that's the news<br/>
And these the same people that supposed to be telling us the truth<br/>
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist<br/>
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit<br/>
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either<br/>
I’ma part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful<br/>
And I believe in the people.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skylar Grey]</i><br/>
It’s so loud inside my head<br/>
With words that I should have said!<br/>
As I drown in my regrets<br/>
I can’t take back the words I never said<br/>
I can’t take back the words I never said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now you can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it<br/>
But if we know better than we probably deserve it<br/>
Jihad is not a holy war, wheres that in the worship?<br/>
Murdering is not Islam!<br/>
And you are not observant<br/>
And you are not a muslim<br/>
Israel don’t take my side cause look how far you’ve pushed them<br/>
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the Kush went<br/>
Complain about the liquor store but what you drinking liquor for?<br/>
Complain about the gloom but when’d you pick a broom up?<br/>
Just listening to Pac ain't gone make it stop<br/>
A rebel in your thoughts, ain't gon make it halt<br/>
If you don’t become an actor you’ll never be a factor<br/>
Pills with million side effects<br/>
Take em when the pains felt<br/>
Wash them down with Diet soda!<br/>
Killin off your brain cells<br/>
Crooked banks around the World<br/>
Would gladly give a loan today<br/>
So if you ever miss a payment<br/>
They can take your home away!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skylar Grey]</i><br/>
It’s so loud inside my head<br/>
With words that I should have said!<br/>
As I drown in my regrets<br/>
I can’t take back the words I never said, never said<br/>
I can’t take back the words I never said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 3]</i><br/>
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence<br/>
Fear is such a weak emotion that's why I despise it<br/>
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth<br/>
So scared of what you think of me, I’m scared of even telling you<br/>
Sometimes I’m like the only person I feel safe to tell it to<br/>
I’m locked inside a cell in me, I know that there’s a jail in you<br/>
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few<br/>
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skylar Grey]</i><br/>
It’s so loud Inside my head<br/>
With words that I should have said!<br/>
As I drown in my regrets<br/>
I can’t take back the words I never said
