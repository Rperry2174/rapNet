<i>[Intro: Pharrell Williams]</i><br/>
I said think about your future<br/>
You can't do that tomorrow<br/>
But you don't hear a word, you see that SLR<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 1]</i><br/>
O' ye tormented souls<br/>
My goal is to sit on the globe like North Poles<br/>
And that's the top mane; goin' hammer like a glock can<br/>
All flowing grammar; no shots strayin'<br/>
I'm so sober when I speak<br/>
I call it catchin' bullets with my teeth<br/>
You can feel it in your chest<br/>
Like Bruce Lee jumpin' on your vest<br/>
But I can't feel yours through my Superman "S"<br/>
Yes, I'm Superman'd-out<br/>
Red Cartier look like Superman's house<br/>
Inshallah to my plan hope it super pans out<br/>
My life is like Italians doin' 100 miles<br/>
And the top open like the roofer ran outta tiles<br/>
Walk right into Felipe's when I ran outta Chow's<br/>
Next up is crustaceans and fast food halals<br/>
The beef is all the same, it's just how they kill the cows<br/>
Somebody tell Malcom X that I'm tryna steal his style<br/>
And tell Cornell West that I'm tryna steal his fro<br/>
Go back in time, take the slaves plows, shovels, and they hoes<br/>
The masters get the "It Was Written" intro<br/>
SLR 10-4<br/>
SLR 10-4<br/>
Soundtrakk let the beat go<br/>
Soundtrakk let the beat roll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
In this World I'm so alone<br/>
In a category all on my own<br/>
Cause I tell the World what I want to<br/>
Yeah I tell the World what I want to<br/>
<br/>
Man I feel so alone<br/>
They treat me like an Outcast<br/>
Cause I tell the world what I want to<br/>
But you can't tell me what you gon' do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
'Cause nigga I don't believe that<br/>
Like 9/11 came from Iraq<br/>
Mayweather on the speed bag<br/>
Automatic weapons keep the same rhythm he has<br/>
That's how the hood sound<br/>
Grew up in the hood town<br/>
West side ghetto, Windy City Cook Count'<br/>
Black skies lookin' up, crack pipes lookin' down<br/>
Accused of not lookin' back, blind nigga look around<br/>
City on my back, so the CHI go everywhere I'm at<br/>
Presence so shiny, Mercedes so matte<br/>
Cop that from Platinum, the color of my plaque<br/>
I memorize colors off of Yo! MTV Raps<br/>
A nightmare walkin' in a psychopath's nap<br/>
Defeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab<br/>
Guess who's sneakin' in the weed bags<br/>
They be me with my mean ass<br/>
Not tryna be anything but free as<br/>
Flow is so nuts, the track is getting' teabagged<br/>
Just wanna rap nice, that ain't me tagged<br/>
If you wanna be mean, then you wanna be me bad<br/>
Call it bein' Pretty Lyrically Swag<br/>
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical<br/>
You can't understand me nor mimic my miracles<br/>
All I see is me and Im a mother lovin' mirror full<br/>
Bein' dope is all in the muscle<br/>
It's more than just a pause and a chuckle<br/>
I bench press elephants, and bowlin' ball juggle<br/>
So dont be scared to take the Super Lu route<br/>
Top 5 alive and I only got 2 out!<br/>
School ya on your history, I tell ya what you 'bout<br/>
Fight for all the right things and let the Huey New out<br/>
Pharrell what these niggas talkin' bout?<br/>
Two man Big Pun, a one man Slaughterhouse<br/>
A two album Jay-Z, a one nigga Wu-Tang<br/>
Young and hungry Mos Def, a conscious rappin' Lil Wayne<br/>
I don't care for similarities<br/>
Cause I'm a pioneer, not a parody<br/>
These aint bars, this is barbarity<br/>
SLR... Clarity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
In this world I'm so alone<br/>
In a category all on my own<br/>
'Cause I tell the world what I want to<br/>
Yeah I tell the world what I want to<br/>
<br/>
Man I feel so alone<br/>
They treat me like an Outcast<br/>
Cause I tell the world what I want to<br/>
But you can't tell me what you gon' do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Holy shock and awe, cattle prods<br/>
All up in the action with a fraction of the catalog<br/>
of my peers, I ain't doin' numbers like Amazon<br/>
but I'm here, and I'm revered<br/>
Lyric boy, Based King, Master Chef, All City Chess moves makin' Donnie Diggy CRS fool<br/>
Carrera Era, pan Amera, F-Tool, Emperor, Free Chilly nigga, FNF Rules<br/>
'Ye, what these niggas talkin' bout?<br/>
A Jesus in the desert walkin', Dundee walkabout<br/>
A self imposed exile, learn to let the awesome out<br/>
Even if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house<br/>
Cause the World is mine, Lupe to the rescue, the World is fine<br/>
Words and lines of mine, I feel are better than every rapper in the World combined!<br/>
And that's how you do it<br/>
Everything flow, everything fluid<br/>
Stupid with the raps, but the raps never stupid<br/>
Trakk on the music, SLR ruthless<br/>
And the next whip is that Ferrari cart<br/>
Game over - body parts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
In this world I'm so alone<br/>
In a category all on my own<br/>
Cause I tell the world what I want to<br/>
Yeah I tell the world what I want to<br/>
<br/>
Man I feel so alone<br/>
They treat me like an Outcast<br/>
Cause I tell the world what I want to<br/>
But you can't tell me what you gon' do
