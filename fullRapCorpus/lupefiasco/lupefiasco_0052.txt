<i>[Background talking]</i><br/>
(I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here,<br/>
You know, I gotta go pay these bills,<br/>
I got a show to do, you know?)<br/>
<br/>
One time, for your mind.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Let's go to sleep in Paris,<br/>
And wake up in Tokyo.<br/>
Have a dream in New Orleans,<br/>
Fall in love in Chicago,<br/>
Mayne.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I love her<br/>
And I hate to leave her lonely<br/>
Ring ring went the Iphone, it was my homie<br/>
He said, "let's hit Japan,<br/>
If we can make 'em jam,<br/>
We can make a hundred grand,<br/>
Spend it in the south of France<br/>
Nothing further." I jumped,<br/>
Grabbed my go-yard trunk,<br/>
Got ready to 'walk it out,' like Unk<br/>
In my John Lennon chucks.<br/>
That's when I heard Murder<br/>
You're killin me, you're fillin me<br/>
With sorrow, sunrise, "goobye"'s,<br/>
And "missin you tomorrow"'s.<br/>
I turn to see my dream<br/>
Love supreme queen, meanest thing on the scene, cry.<br/>
I drop my bags in a flash<br/>
That's faster one eighty on that dash-er,<br/>
To dry your tears.<br/>
And wipe the rain from my dear like dash-er,<br/>
Use the dame who's the username to all my pass-words.<br/>
The reason I get fly as Ivan Jasp-er,<br/>
I even keep your picture in my pass-purt.<br/>
(love love)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Let's go to sleep in Paris,<br/>
And wake up in Tokyo.<br/>
Have a dream in New Orleans,<br/>
Fall in love in Chicago,<br/>
Mayne.<br/>
<br/>
Then we can land in the motherland,<br/>
Camelback across the desert sand.<br/>
Take a train, to Rome, or home,<br/>
Brazil, forreal.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
So let's keep it, real,<br/>
All in't together, "free chill!"<br/>
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie, on the reel.<br/>
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills,<br/>
Lean back in my first-class seat, and sleep.<br/>
Don't wake me till I land, when they barely understand<br/>
What I speak, but they nod to my beats.<br/>
I tell my fans who I am and they stand and they clap<br/>
They applaud. They love me, my God.<br/>
"Otsukare-sama deshita" or maybe "au revoir,"<br/>
"A spree on Saint Henry," then back to Charles de Gaulle.<br/>
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been,<br/>
And, everything that I done, and,<br/>
Tell her that she's the one, and, um.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Let's go to sleep in Paris,<br/>
And wake up in Tokyo.<br/>
Have a dream in New Orleans,<br/>
Fall in love in Chicago,<br/>
Mayne.<br/>
<br/>
Then we can land in the motherland,<br/>
Camelback across the desert sand.<br/>
Take a train, to Rome, or home,<br/>
Brazil, forreal.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Uh.<br/>
Guess who's back in the, house,<br/>
With a bunch of souvenirs, and a smile for your mouth.<br/>
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you<br/>
In my dreams, 'fore I went to sleep, to La-La land to count them sheep.<br/>
I swear you're lookin prettier than ever,<br/>
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together ever more.<br/>
For better or, less or poor, all worth the wait in buried treasure<br/>
X's on the shore.<br/>
I know my world tour's like war to you,<br/>
But Ian said, "Aloha," and Harley said, "Cheers!"<br/>
Julian said, "Bonjour!," Big O was like "Yeahhhhh!"<br/>
Amanda and Lemessie want to know when we goin there.<br/>
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club<br/>
Of the international play-boys and play-girls.<br/>
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness,<br/>
She said, "Pursue your interests, 'cause even If<br/>
I'm ticketless, I'll be there, by your side,<br/>
In your heart and, on your mind."<br/>
So, as I taxi down another runway,<br/>
I gotcha, who loves you babe<br/>
Now bring it back, now, uh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Let's go to sleep in Paris,<br/>
And wake up in Tokyo.<br/>
Have a dream in New Orleans,<br/>
Fall in love in Chicago,<br/>
Mayne.<br/>
<br/>
Then we can land in the motherland,<br/>
Camelback across the desert sand.<br/>
Take a train, to Rome, or home,<br/>
Brazil, forreal.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.<br/>
Wherever I go she goes.
