<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I told you I would show up screaming FNF<br/>
Till the world, blow up, they said I was so finished<br/>
I told 'em its show business<br/>
Meaning it's no business, since Fiasco's in it<br/>
Disrespect the dress code; wear my street clothes in it<br/>
Measured, sold, and clothed in it<br/>
Opened up clones, after I entered and drove in it, like unh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Only fear God<br/>
Know the weapons of the weak<br/>
The weakness of the hard<br/>
And never fall asleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Roll in it, let music bumping, windows tinted<br/>
Through they neighborhoods and all of the wolves in it<br/>
It's already controlled in it<br/>
Seen it come and go, selling they soul in it<br/>
Diamond and gold plated<br/>
Fountain of youth, dipping my toes in it<br/>
Bounced in the booth, spit it, like scolding it<br/>
Putting my heart and my soul in it<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I only fear God<br/>
Know the weapons of the weak<br/>
The weakness of the hard<br/>
And never fall asleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Once upon a time, not long ago<br/>
Where the pushaman creep, where they live life po'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
With fifteen in the clip and one in the hold<br/>
Hallway wall full of bricks, only some of us know<br/>
None of us know the makers of the toast<br/>
Like the bottom of the stove, that was used in the murderin' of the scroll<br/>
Heart colder than EDs<br/>
Won't let the CD's city defeat me<br/>
Rub me out like genies; smoke a sweet to my graffiti<br/>
Nigga what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I only fear God<br/>
Know the weapons of the weak<br/>
The weakness of the hard<br/>
And I will never sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
Marvin Billups said what's up to the reaper<br/>
Hell met like Riddell and high water hello<br/>
To the five year old gunshot killer, I hear ya<br/>
Clearer than the invisible man in the mirror<br/>
Cheer up, I'll put in on the bars like beer nuts<br/>
Put a bug in they ear, so from here up, they hear us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Then we only fear God<br/>
Know the weapons of the weak<br/>
The weakness of the hard<br/>
And we will never sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Once upon a time, not long ago<br/>
Where the pushaman creep, where they live life po'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5:]</i><br/>
I put it on my grand mama's daughter<br/>
My microphone control of the soul of slave humming "Wading in the Water"<br/>
I author like DW's brother, like a hustler<br/>
God place me in ya armor, I prescribe no partners<br/>
I do it for the hood like a parka<br/>
And tell my niggas not to shiver<br/>
Only time we quiver like a archer is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cause we only fear God<br/>
Know the weapons of the weak<br/>
The weakness of the hard<br/>
And we will never sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6:]</i><br/>
Here we are now, entertain us<br/>
Change don't change us<br/>
Ever since the game trained us<br/>
We came up like worms in the rain<br/>
I dream my chain became a loose noose that was used to hang us<br/>
So now, my insane brain, my 32 teeth<br/>
And two feet creep like its Elm Street<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I only fear God<br/>
Know the weapons of the weak<br/>
The weakness of the hard<br/>
And I will never sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Once upon a time, not long ago<br/>
Where the pushaman creep, where they live life po'<br/>
