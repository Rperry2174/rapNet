Balance<br/>
A drunken ground for my niggas<br/>
But what if up was down for the liquor?<br/>
Then pour in something stiffer<br/>
Filter mud from the champagne on blood<br/>
Might just milk a tub out my hand vein<br/>
Ivy league, I receive, Irie vibes<br/>
What a dream! What I mean? Ideaize<br/>
You see the storm brewing way up in the heaven<br/>
A statue wouldn't mourn'em so I wake up to erect, damn<br/>
And the bed made of women<br/>
Who came first with a head made of chickens?<br/>
Break the fast, break the mask on a egg-making mission<br/>
With X-rated visions<br/>
And the glass<br/>
I wish that I could live inside jazz<br/>
As hecklers shekel magpie<br/>
Note-blowing standard<br/>
Scat over improvised ragtime<br/>
Red magic, dead rabbit, energize me back <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
Feather me or let it be<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
Tether me or sever me<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
Definitely won't set me free<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
But you look like a set of keys<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
<br/>
May I die from a hand that is not black<br/>
Lie down my crown where Mike Brown dropped at<br/>
At the spot where he was unchained<br/>
To pour liquor on it and watch a King grow from the blood stains<br/>
Then hug him, I'm just here, I ain't here to judge him<br/>
I hear the jeers, the cheers, I'm adjusted<br/>
It's the day, it's judgement<br/>
(Ankh: hers)<br/>
For the sippers and the drinkers<br/>
Lift her by the shoulders like hangers<br/>
Pterodactyls, there are damsels, in their fingers<br/>
Ambulance chasers bad chance ain't no mash for the bangers<br/>
Ash with a bad hand, cash for the danger<br/>
Bottom made of glass, shake that ass for the strangers<br/>
I'm on the wrath with the danglers, shaking my shaft<br/>
You just bass to the anglers (hooked)<br/>
Drift to mausoleum, shackle my feet in 1919<br/>
Hollerin' droppin' cosmopolitans on the crime scene<br/>
Xenophobian, hemoglobin soakin' on white queens<br/>
Pale-face invaders to foreign devils and gaijin<br/>
<br/>
Feather me or let it be<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
Tether me or sever me<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
Definitely won't set me free<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
But you look like a set of keys<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
<br/>
Has the moon killed the sun yet?<br/>
Over dim sum steamed bamboo basket bun sets<br/>
A brisk run to keep the lungs fresh<br/>
Hung sweats on the radiator<br/>
Two shanks for the date rapers and baby tapers<br/>
Clear the vision with the spit inside the aviators<br/>
Legit but quit because the lick promised them pits of paper<br/>
Will we eliminate the innovators?<br/>
Will we commemorate the imitators?<br/>
You are now set tripping with eliminators<br/>
Life given persimmons<br/>
So now your lemons persimmon flavored<br/>
Why you mixing different neighbors? Spike it<br/>
Now the wrists are slitting razors<br/>
(Ankh: hers)<br/>
The benefits of red wine<br/>
Drunken box thieves fighting bars to charge a dead mine<br/>
Iron wing Icarus, dip a bit, fly a Siamese chicken strips<br/>
Well-designed to keep from liftin' shit<br/>
<br/>
Feather me or let it be<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
Tether me or sever me<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
Definitely won't set me free<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)<br/>
But you look like a set of keys<br/>
(My nigga, what's up?)
