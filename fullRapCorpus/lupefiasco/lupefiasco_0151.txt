<i>[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Ye<br/>
I used to be good<br/>
Now I'm a sellout<br/>
Fuck yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]</i><br/>
Say she wanna be held like a mink in the winter, no no<br/>
She ask me how do I feel, how do I feel, no no<br/>
You know snitches get stitches (snitches get snitches)<br/>
Ignorance is bliss, can a nigga get a witness?<br/>
I'll tell you what<br/>
I ain't gotta trick on nothing, no no<br/>
I ain't tripping on you, I ain't tripping, I ain't tricking on you<br/>
They be tricking on you but I ain't tricking on you<br/>
They be snitching telling me all about you<br/>
I'm a take my time, that's what a nigga gonna do<br/>
I ain't tripping I ain't tricking on you, they be tricking on you<br/>
But I ain't tricking on you<br/>
They told me all about you, oh no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
You ain't gotta plan on it<br/>
Me sitting on a stand with a bible with a hand on it<br/>
They be talking like the man on it<br/>
You can play the tape and understand what he saying on it<br/>
Niggas sounding like Sam on it, Teflon Don why you sticking to the band homie<br/>
From a good fella to a teller<br/>
Niggas jumping dimes in the bags in the bands on it<br/>
I'm a just land on it<br/>
Plant my flag like a moon with a man on it<br/>
They be singing to the choir with a wire<br/>
But this the eighteen gold chains with the van on it<br/>
This the eighteen gold chains with the van on it<br/>
Life is a beach with some sand and a tan on it<br/>
But it's getting too high<br/>
Spread the money out now look like a fan on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Now if you only love me for the money<br/>
Then that mean you gon leave if they come and take it from me<br/>
Now I ain't saying I ain't Fort Knox<br/>
But you never know who be at the do' when the door knock<br/>
That's why we keep the door locked<br/>
Keep an open mind but I ain't messing with the door stops<br/>
God forbid that the dough stop<br/>
If the paper wrinkle we can hit it with the Botox<br/>
Nigga get fo' shots smelling new money call it their nose jobs<br/>
And we been working for it so hard<br/>
Best believe we ain't hurting for a blowjob<br/>
Why you twerking for it so hard?<br/>
Working with them people for some gold y'all<br/>
Keep my mind on them gold bars<br/>
Crucial crucial crucial go hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Independent women get the "all cool"<br/>
Gold digging bitches get the door foo<br/>
Don't misinterpret what you're hearing<br/>
I ain't tryna get out, I'm tryna put some years in<br/>
And ya gotta lay a foundation<br/>
Break it down basic can't play around payin<br/>
Niggas ain't saying they ain't makin downpayments<br/>
But when they ain't at the station turnin states makin statements<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
