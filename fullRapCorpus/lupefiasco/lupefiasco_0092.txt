<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Lu, coupe, no, more doors<br/>
Porsche or, no, more doors, sedan<br/>
Hmmm, 4-more, no, more doors, more doors than that<br/>
Lord of the Rings, that Frodo went to war for, you'll see more war than<br/>
World War 4 or Lord of War when Nicolas lost his 'brothor'<br/>
Brougham, no, man, too slow for my program<br/>
Need Punk rock, not slow jams, mosh pits not hold hands<br/>
Or slow dance, or romance, I'll take this bitch like Lo Pan<br/>
Put her right into Do's hands, tell her how this gon' go, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Dosage &amp; Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Animals, animals, we are more like cannibals<br/>
Follow rules, what rules? We don't ever answer to<br/>
No King Tuts, no presidents, this is more like a ritual<br/>
What am I scared of death for? Life is just an interlude<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Dosage]</i><br/>
Let's begin this interview, I know they got a lot of questions<br/>
I don't have on a unitard, but I can answer the detective<br/>
None of these dicks can trace me, I don't go that direction<br/>
This is the beginning of a massacre, I'm tired of getting treated like a step-kid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
This where I step in, cause this Dosage from Philly and he so sick<br/>
He's my friend, so he's your friend, it's who Lupe Fiasco's with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dosage:]</i><br/>
They wanna know if I'm insane, I just don't accept defeat<br/>
But since I'm nominated this is gonna be my acceptance speech<br/>
Your big bro requestin' me 'cause I'm a friend of the people and I'm next to be<br/>
In the game, I don't hear the referees whistling technically<br/>
Dixie, let me sing!<br/>
<br/>
I forever see<br/>
Don't go back or forever be a slave to the nation<br/>
Touch√©, Lupe, this is history in the making<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
We so in Smithsonians when the story ends<br/>
We was there when the story started, making history before we's artists<br/>
You know we's targets: Tar-get, it's always star shit<br/>
Or shall I say hot-wired, ride around reckless and double-park it<br/>
Look how many fines that the car get<br/>
Take the boots off it, throw the tickets in the garbage<br/>
Then go to court just to get up on some smart shit<br/>
Tell the motherfucking judge it's all ours, bitch
