This one's for Chilly Chill, (Food and Liquor) flow<br/>
Strong like it's been distilled by<br/>
Hillbillies in the hills and we move down to Beverly<br/>
So heavenly, waking niggas up like revelry<br/>
We won't be going back to you regularly, so forget it<br/>
Shadow flow, colder than Punxsutawney Phillip<br/>
My mind's on dope, my brain's on skillets<br/>
Thoroughly trained to just bang off lyrics<br/>
Bang bang bang like Pops Wayans<br/>
(Witherspoon) or with a fork<br/>
Was coming out my egg like Mork, deserves his own head on Rushmore<br/>
Flood the game like a giant in a dwarf's shorts<br/>
So long niggas, career so short it should be riding on a horse<br/>
Mines is a horse, but mines is the size you could sneak inside a fort<br/>
Yours is a pony, it could sleep inside a Porsche<br/>
I am on point like the eating side of forks<br/>
So keep your head down like your reflection in a spoon<br/>
Chilly Chill will be out of corrections real soon<br/>
Enemy, god willingly
