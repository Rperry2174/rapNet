They wanna start again, no arguing<br/>
Guns in the car for them<br/>
Hit 'em while they feet on they ottomans<br/>
Off guard, uh huh, blow 'em out they cardigans<br/>
They case hardening, they at the table bargaining<br/>
No time for stuck safeties or shaky targeting<br/>
Hit the face, hit the safe and the carpet and<br/>
Get the weight, get the cake, get the tape that we starred in<br/>
Escape, hit the interstate partying<br/>
They guardians is soft frames as jellyfish<br/>
Give 'em shirts they can strain spaghetti with<br/>
Extra button holes for touching those<br/>
They rarely kick, my readiness only matched by my pettiness<br/>
Get the change, where the couch at<br/>
Pick pocket fleas, please get the cheese off they mousetraps<br/>
Remember, they holdin' just like us<br/>
Burners under the furniture, 4-4's in floorboards<br/>
Murderers, burglars, they game just as hood<br/>
And they aim just as good, a little better<br/>
Little Berettas with suppressors<br/>
And all the etceteras for whatever<br/>
We can pole climb, cut phone lines, the whole nine<br/>
But we gotta stay together, that's the key to this<br/>
Even if it's no longer secretive<br/>
They gonna start panicking when they see that you backstage without the laminent<br/>
Don't ease up, niggas tend to freeze up, become mannequins<br/>
What about you<br/>
Don't worry bout me<br/>
I'm averaging fifty shots a game when it's crackling<br/>
Turn the lights off on they ambulance<br/>
Just, give me room to operate<br/>
They be in operating rooms with wounds to contemplate<br/>
Don't speak, no room to commentate<br/>
Make sure ya sneakers tied, no shoes to confiscate<br/>
Get aways, take cables out they Sables<br/>
Slash the tires on they Chryslers, no survivors<br/>
Niggas can't make it with MacGyver<br/>
Either you get them or they get you<br/>
No amount of karate class can keep you outta body bags<br/>
So save ya boxing and Ninjitsu<br/>
Don't be cheap, bullets is ten cents apiece<br/>
Give 'em each a saw buck the instant they reach<br/>
Moving on, make sure you know who's who<br/>
Who's you, who's not, and who to shoot upon<br/>
Friendly fire and hitting innocent standbyers'll<br/>
Get your enemy wired and it's bad enough<br/>
So don't go gassing em up<br/>
Leave that for the shells, the 12's from the pumps<br/>
If done correct, the condo's on me<br/>
Gotta go, rock-n-roll, lock and load on three
