As I proceed to go dig through an old crib<br/>
Hold kids as I blunder through a pharaoh house<br/>
Thug Bones in guild did the parrow piss<br/>
But arrow heads then let the marrow out<br/>
I literally won't leave lettuce since I've received the brita<br/>
And when the sea leaves the land, who will feed the rivers, huh?<br/>
Crazy busy, make me, make me miss ya even when I'm with ya<br/>
If a phone calls in the club, but the music is too loud around to hear it<br/>
Do I still have to clear it?<br/>
Example: now I don’t list samples in my lyrics<br/>
Myth be told, 60 souls perished in the perish bill<br/>
Rode a pair of wheels on 50 scrolls with a pair of quills<br/>
Answered the question Americas, Amerikills<br/>
Been living inside envelopes with a pair of sills<br/>
Tall man like <i>[?]</i> downfall from a pair of stilts wearin' heels, that's high<br/>
As I proceed to find silver lining, it's stalagmite<br/>
Cat eyes and scarab crowns on a black grace<br/>
Two wave, not to see bubonic plague on your rat face<br/>
Practice on the uttering till it lactates<br/>
Then begin the butterin' of the pancakes<br/>
Push it to the margin flood the garden to the land lakes<br/>
Associate with mates who spit inside of they handshakes, yeah<br/>
<br/>
As I walk through the shadow of San Fernando Valley<br/>
Walkin' like fingers how, how they rally on pianos<br/>
Up and down the dials I WKRP, in Cincinnati<br/>
Let's settle on the station like "Last gas for 100 miles"<br/>
May I have this last dance?<br/>
Grab her hands then proceed to do the runnin' child<br/>
Vindaloo the stomach growls, introduced to somethin' wild<br/>
Until we see civilization, Walmarts and Chik-a-falashios<br/>
Patients, our art isn't intimidation<br/>
But you can't process the progress<br/>
If you get your style ques from outta Complex<br/>
Nah nigga, that ain't hot<br/>
No, no and no shots, no boas and no thots<br/>
I walk 'em over to motorboat on the yachts<br/>
To go so sober on all the shirk and on overdose on salats, haann<br/>
Francis Ford Coppola’s broken plots<br/>
Hyannis Port localists rollin' in open drops<br/>
Titanic corpse smokin' from openin' dose with chops<br/>
Like Cannock moonlit leader loakin' with loaded Glocks, haaaan!
