<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Black Panther, Black Panther, what do you see?<br/>
I see a dream ITAL watching over me<br/>
Back nigga<br/>
Yeah, hey, can we get a little break<br/>
From the cocaine and the kilos<br/>
Aiight nigga, we know<br/>
Aiight nigga, we know<br/>
Can we get a break from the strippers on the pill<br/>
Aiight nigga, we know<br/>
Okay nigga, we know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Hey shawty, ain't no future in no gang-bang<br/>
And ain't no manhood in no bang-bang<br/>
Ain't no honor cleanin interstates inside a chain-gang<br/>
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe<br/>
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing<br/>
'Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain<br/>
Get yourself a Camry, "nigga said a Camry?"<br/>
Watch that ho depreciate and then you'll understand me<br/>
It's called being fiscally responsible<br/>
Don't let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you<br/>
The TV's not your father fool, that video's not your momma<br/>
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
May we have some roses for the ladies<br/>
A little appreciation for the gentlemen<br/>
And here's some kisses for the babies<br/>
Some peacenality for the whole wide-wide-wide world<br/>
More patience to the youth, sympathy for the poor<br/>
Empathy for the old, more justice for the down and pressed<br/>
Treat no liar ITAL, AY-YAH!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
I know you're sayin', "Lupe rappin 'bout the same shit"<br/>
Well, that's 'cause ain't shit changed, bitch<br/>
And please don't excuse my language<br/>
Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent<br/>
The true expression of my anguish<br/>
And by this far I ain't shocked, upset, or appalled<br/>
I'm ashamed, bitch<br/>
I can't listen if you ain't sayin shit<br/>
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous<br/>
Ain't buildin up they confidence, we teachin 'em that they ain't shit<br/>
If they ain't got the latest that they saw on someone famous<br/>
Mercy of the Lord on this double-edged sword<br/>
Instead of askin where the hoes is<br/>
Maybe maybe we could ask for roses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Called the President a terrorist<br/>
Corporate sponsors like, how the fuck you gon' embarrass us?<br/>
Ain't my fault, I was just repeatin this<br/>
Professor emeritus from America<br/>
But my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home<br/>
Blew that bitch up with a drone<br/>
An Iraqi with no daddy, Palestinian throwing stones<br/>
The fuck you think they call him, I'mma leave that all alone<br/>
Cause this, the focus on this new shit is that hopeless<br/>
Place that I was born into systematic brokeness<br/>
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness<br/>
It's that great American rap-rap ferocious<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
