<i>[Hook - Lupe Fiasco x2:]</i><br/>
Filet mignon with my food stamps<br/>
Car cosigned by my mama<br/>
Medical card from Obama<br/>
Background check for a chopper<br/>
<br/>
Background check for a chopper<br/>

<i>[Glasses Malone:]</i><br/>
I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide<br/>
My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps<br/>
That’s three muscles recertified<br/>
I’m right, niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems<br/>
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit I’m buyin’<br/>
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese<br/>
Got a Chevy trailer in my mama yard, sittin’ on E’s<br/>
I’m bout this fee, I’m bout this fee<br/>
Just know what’s free<br/>
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth so don’t critique<br/>
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga tryna get this cake<br/>
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate<br/>
Filet mignon for my food stamps I know mama credit quite good<br/>
So I’m out here with this dope money got a big body in my hood<br/>
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m bout<br/>
Got a trap house I be boomin’ in, fiends in and out<br/>
Cut the J anyway it come nigga, section 8<br/>
See we straight, how much money I make<br/>
This block <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Buk of Psychodrama:]</i><br/>
Filet mignon with my food stamps<br/>
Would tell you don’t really want be the truth<br/>
Let me hit you back on my government phone<br/>
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?<br/>
We get a blunt and a joint out of <i>[?]</i><br/>
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans<br/>
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes<br/>
Ain’t nobody fit to do shit important<br/>
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing<br/>
Although they may smile and be cordial<br/>
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd<br/>
Then bring a frown to my friend <i>[?]</i> warn you<br/>
Background check for the chopper<br/>
<i>[?]</i> imposters<br/>
The murder rate ain’t back down yet<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
To the nigga that was tryna say somethin’<br/>
Some people, listen, you could be predisposed or be preconditioned<br/>
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching be the person<br/>
To be some process in your progress or be the prevention<br/>
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin’ until God tell me to<br/>
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?<br/>
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that<br/>
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them it's still a fact<br/>
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine<br/>
You’ll shortly find that this is best for everyone involved<br/>
All in all <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trouble:]</i><br/>
Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor<br/>
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler<br/>
I been servin’ since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles<br/>
My teachers all told me that were probable<br/>
Probable cause, no crack a never really had it<br/>
I was just a nigga in a high price whip<br/>
Yea, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto<br/>
Well you better have extension on the clip<br/>
Well beef comes around in the town more often than these bitches in motion<br/>
I got a yapper, five dollars, off the streets<br/>
Yea I’m told for protection more than anything<br/>
Don’t test my devotion<br/>
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we out smokin’<br/>
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focussin’ on other environments<br/>
<i>[?]</i> more fiends <i>[?]</i><br/>
Apologize cause <i>[?]</i> promotin’<br/>
Chopper and my bitch they ain’t kissin’ light somebody up<br/>
You just tell them <i>[?]</i> who stole it<br/>
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see that’s all they know<br/>
Without it kinda hopeless<br/>
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma<br/>
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't wanna <i>[?]</i><br/>
Lu probly tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down<br/>
Feelin’ these all in your background<br/>
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma<br/>
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't wanna <i>[?]</i><br/>
Lu probly tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down<br/>
Feelin’ these all in your background<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trae tha Truth:]</i><br/>
I used to run up in your crib with shit that go ‘blaka<br/>
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka<br/>
I don’t want a single chain I can’t rocka<br/>
<i>[?]</i> life is a bitch, can’t stop her<br/>
Even if I could, I tell ‘em I wouldn’t knock her<br/>
Til the get the 6 and then swap her<br/>
Baby mama tax return, new dropper<br/>
I might wanna so sip that bitch like I’m <i>[?]</i><br/>
All of my whips <i>[?]</i> bought a house<br/>
Food stamp, get flipped, what that water cost?<br/>
Yea I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit<br/>
Filet Mignon the house<br/>
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street<br/>
Nigga health care insured by that guap<br/>
More ways than <i>[?]</i> to me <i>[?]</i><br/>
Jackals playin’ overseas with they yacht<br/>
Shit I probly be the same I find drama<br/>
Law’s out lookin’ for me like Osama<br/>
I don’t wanna do no bid, yo honor<br/>
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama<br/>
Tell ‘em I need the chopper<br/>
They tellin’ me i'm a fellon<br/>
I beat the case and that’s it<br/>
And I wasn’t acquainted with him<br/>
But I’m tryna make it to Heaven<br/>
But they don’t want me to make it<br/>
That’s why the niggas be tellin’ me<br/>
If I don’t get the chopper I’mma probly run up inside them<br/>
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool<br/>
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it<br/>
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school<br/>
Bed blues, everybody open up somethin’<br/>
You can move all you want just not southern<br/>
It ain’t no thinkin’ I was playin’ I am not frontin<br/>
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fam-Lay:]</i><br/>
Storm is gone now it’s all clear<br/>
The road was long but we all here<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I don’t care<br/>
2014 is our year<br/>
Big shout out to the whole streets<br/>
This goes out to all that knows me<br/>
All y’all pussy niggas, holies<br/>
Y’all play tough guys but call the police<br/>
Look I don’t care, I don’t share<br/>
I keep me a bad bitch around here<br/>
I send them choppers around there<br/>
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair<br/>
Overseas, blowin’ tree, blowin’ green, throwin’ B's<br/>
Livin’ like life is supposed to be<br/>
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me<br/>
To the top, couldn’t stop, had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop<br/>
Nigas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop<br/>
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop<br/>
Think so slick, come and get me dog<br/>
None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog<br/>
Some of y’all niggas comin’ with me dog<br/>
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog<br/>
You think an echo was y’all<br/>
You need to think tactical dog<br/>
We laughin’ at y’all<br/>
While you thinking me and Lu <i>[?]</i><br/>
Seein’ this shit that keep goin’ on<br/>
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes<br/>
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone<br/>
When you sippin’ that shit we keep blowin’ on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Billy Blue:]</i><br/>
I’m bout that, I’m bout that<br/>
That billy out in that driveway<br/>
Cost more than my house did<br/>
Fuck land, I’m fly today<br/>
First class if I fly<br/>
Credit card ain’t mine<br/>
Don’t know how I’m getitn’ back<br/>
But in luxury I arrive<br/>
IPhone in my baby name<br/>
Long way from that chirp<br/>
Strip pole in my bedroom<br/>
But I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk<br/>
I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk<br/>
Miley Cyrus is that bullshit<br/>
But a rednecker can’t judge<br/>
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with<br/>
Record deal, fuck college<br/>
Missed out but no pyrex<br/>
My Harley got low milage<br/>
This white carpet in my project<br/>
30 guns in my section, none of the homies got <i>[?]</i><br/>
My side bitch and she pregnant<br/>
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game<br/>
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game<br/>
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game<br/>
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his mama<br/>
So he don’t got my name<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Mirrors loose as my <i>[?]</i><br/>
I ain’t addicted to shit<br/>
My weed man on my speed dial<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop<br/>
AR-15 with collapsible stock<br/>
Picket <i>[?]</i> with a 3 point <i>[?]</i><br/>
Wish 150 round magazine and a dot<br/>
FMJ’s by the box, nigga<br/>
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga<br/>
Shouldn’t find that surprising<br/>
Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop<br/>
Ain’t seen a lot of brown money as a shorty<br/>
Welfare baby can’t afford me<br/>
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried<br/>
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried<br/>
Excuse me, as I repeat myself<br/>
Work twice as hard to complete myself<br/>
My opposition is not pretending<br/>
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself<br/>
Fuck being a hip hop purist<br/>
When I'm spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus<br/>
At least it’s a contradiction, you’ll feel us<br/>
RIP to the homies but long live the killas<br/>
It’s why I look at God kinda odd<br/>
Cause these are the cards that he deal us<br/>
<i>[?]</i> can’t feel us, Medicare can’t heal us<br/>
And the mamas can’t stop us<br/>
And these choppers might kill us<br/>
Look these wild niggas in they eyes<br/>
In the video it's some niggas that done died<br/>
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried<br/>
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride<br/>
<i>[?]</i> sayin’ free the guys like I’m dirty<br/>
With a clean record but I’m cursed<br/>
To make a half a million off a verse<br/>
Nigga, chop
