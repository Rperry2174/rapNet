Young peerer over Dilla<br/>
Behind the mic like the will of a vehicular killer<br/>
The threading, put it together like a three minutes to wedding<br/>
In less than three minutes of meddling, over melody and grand pian peddlings<br/>
I do represent the mind like IQs, intelligent signs in our kind’s a haiku<br/>
Cobra kai turn high top fade to Caillou, who inspect a man stance and fight the kaiju<br/>
Way beyond a hundred kicks, breaking bottom bricks and he on number six<br/>
This is that “there should be a name for it”<br/>
Hideo should go and make a game for it<br/>
Mama should make you change for it<br/>
Kinda rap that sends jaguars running back into the rain forest<br/>
Plans over panic, when Superman scans deadpan over planets<br/>
Make the fat man hand over the ham jam and lamb and Spam sandwich<br/>
A face black eyes and hand-to-hand damage<br/>
Make ‘em believe you can manage to have swam the span famine<br/>
Sesame the bird big, and the master plan mammoth
