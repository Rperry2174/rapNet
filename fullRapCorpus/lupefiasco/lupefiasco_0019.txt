<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
When your spirit is strained and you limited to change<br/>
The lyrics in your limericks will change<br/>
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged<br/>
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in your slang<br/>
Sounds more belligerent when it's sang,<br/>
The truth...is limitless in its range<br/>
If you, drop a "T" and look at it in reverse,<br/>
It could hurt, look at the grimaces of the pain<br/>
And it's worse when it works, and ya membership is game<br/>
But you forgetting the proof, diminishes in the flames<br/>
Like poof, the media pours images in your brain<br/>
Of the score of the war where militants is slain<br/>
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed<br/>
And they filthy, the deaf ears are the winners<br/>
The listeners are the lames...<br/>
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became so...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone? (Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah)<br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone?<br/>
Glory,Glory...<br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone? (Where forth has my Glory gone?)<br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone?<br/>
Glory,Glory...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
But you gotta understand our differences is the same<br/>
What starts in clouded minds, finishes in the reign<br/>
Of the fools that are used as instruments in the game<br/>
Where oppression is the queen and ignorance is the king<br/>
Where revolution is dead...<br/>
No candles in its memory, No remembrance of its fame<br/>
Just a mystery, no mentioning the history of the chained<br/>
The enemy, no Hennessey sentiments in its name<br/>
Just a unmarked grave that menaces had defamed<br/>
With the propaganda, and images of the gangs<br/>
A lost art, no apprentices in the trained<br/>
And they brainwashed, no interest in this thang<br/>
And the minds weary all the adrenaline in the drain<br/>
While the wrecking balls is disassembling things<br/>
Our highness is the cause, its imminence is the blame<br/>
The pride is still here, the pillagers still remain, but...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone? (Where forth has my Glory gone?)<br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone?<br/>
Glory,Glory...<br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone? (Where forth has my Glory gone?)<br/>
Where forth has my Glory gone?<br/>
Glory,Glory...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
And you gotta respect a position in which you playing<br/>
Never let your heart reflect the conditions in which you staying<br/>
Even if it's dark, and the temperature is the same<br/>
As winters in the Ukraine, ya appendages is in chains<br/>
Have forgiveness from the start, keep maliciousness restrained<br/>
Be smart, never indiscriminate in your aim<br/>
Cuz it's innocent witnesses oblivious to the thangs<br/>
To come the ones that hypnotists keep entertained<br/>
And you can't uh have some resilience in ya frame<br/>
Stay resistance and committed to what you saying<br/>
Cuz, they'll flip it the minute that you refrain<br/>
Read the book and the lines, and literature in between<br/>
You gotta be educated when going against the grain<br/>
Pay attention, they illegitimate in they claims<br/>
They assisted in the killing and pillaging<br/>
In addition to the addiction, shit is much bigger than just in plain, but...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus till fade]</i>
