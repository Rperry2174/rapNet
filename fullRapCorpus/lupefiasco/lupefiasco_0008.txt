Ya hopefully hand over the Land Rover keys<br/>
Slowly and run like hosiery<br/>
I move eggs like ovaries<br/>
Closed lactose and sudairy<br/>
Who y'all suppose to be?<br/>
None of them close to me, my poetry poison til' they posing me<br/>
And little kids poking me openly<br/>
Fuck police I slip through they fingers like rosaries<br/>
Off the hook with the .38 rotaries<br/>
Get it locally move anti-socially<br/>
Twice the rapper get it from both of me jokingly<br/>
So constant and nonchalant from BIC's to Mont Blanc's<br/>
Who's conscience he's not the one to confront<br/>
Worth my weight you impersonate niggas like<br/>
Miller Light spit it right in your life, terminate<br/>
I'm the worst case scenario<br/>
Bump heads for coins like Mario<br/>
Pop more rounds than Merry-Go(-rounds), from birth date to burial<br/>
In South Beach beeches going south with they mouth piece without speech<br/>
Oh now he's official from the start<br/>
They miss you, holding vigils in the dark<br/>
Go head try and stop it, couldn't block sun with Hawaiian Tropic<br/>
What's in your pockets my profits<br/>
Foxes pick me up like chop sticks, this hotness<br/>
They wanna put me in boxes like chocolates...that's nonsense<br/>
Nothin' sweet about this but the hotel room Presidential like the wrist<br/>
I know, I'm sorry I never meant to end shit<br/>
Never rental get mine freeway like Van wyck<br/>
Peace to Francis and all my manz(iz)<br/>
Take trips to France(iz) where all my manz is<br/>
With fifths in handz(iz) rewind and chant this, niggas!<br/>
<br/>
I got a bezel from embezzlin' Good Heavens! And they said I lost it in 97'<br/>
About to start using Mexicans not cause they better than just cause I get Si Senor not I need more<br/>
With chicks from Singapore from bunk beds ?<br/>
To tour room Colonials and still testimonial<br/>
And so I keep it secret, in the kitchen in the cabinet in a jar where the grease is<br/>
L-U-P speaks it til' its pieces, peanut butta like<br/>
Always being a quiet cat not the meanest motherfucker type<br/>
For a hundred grand plus, I'd be buffin' brass Knucks<br/>
Best listen to your dawgs, get Son of Sam'd up, what!<br/>
Ahead of my time, failed history passed chemistry, quiet nines in Quinine<br/>
My energy always be weaponry to unload, while there's people to holdup reputations to uphold<br/>
I'm Gung Ho with them white lines, not the kind that divides traffic<br/>
But the kind that reminds addicts, automatics to yo attic<br/>
Tecked out Porsche' in the decked out Boxter WASup!<br/>
Fed's is nice with the camera's, challengers get beat black and lavender<br/>
Women put my name across they chest like janitors<br/>
Fans of the, hustler under the stairs his fiends on the banisters WHAT!!!
