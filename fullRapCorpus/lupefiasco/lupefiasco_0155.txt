Yo<br/>
(Hold it now)<br/>
Uh<br/>
Get up and walk up to her and say<br/>
(Go over there)<br/>
Hi, that's all you gotta do is say hi<br/>
That's all you gotta do, say hi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lupe Talking To Girl]</i><br/>
Well, I know I'm not the coolest<br/>
And this might sound kind of foolish<br/>
'Cause I know I'm not the smoothest<br/>
Told myself I shouldn't do this<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I'm not very well suited<br/>
Not the popularist of students<br/>
We ain't in the same crowd<br/>
Always see you with the hoopers<br/>
<br/>
But we got the same lunch<br/>
You might see me with the cooler<br/>
That's 'cause I don't eat pork<br/>
You can never be sure<br/>
Oh, you like Linkin' Park<br/>
That's the hat from the tour<br/>
<br/>
I got a autographed shirt<br/>
They wrote, "Much love to ya"<br/>
Man that's really funny<br/>
How we like tha same music<br/>
But I really love jazz<br/>
<br/>
I was gonna play the tuba<br/>
I tried to join tha band<br/>
They said I was really really bad<br/>
Didn't really make me sad<br/>
<br/>
I'm used to being the loser<br/>
But you, I think you're super<br/>
So much I had to pursue ya<br/>
I don't believe the things they say<br/>
Or the football teams rumors<br/>
<br/>
Tha quarterback can't spell<br/>
I'm his after school tutor<br/>
I just took a cue from cupid<br/>
Now I think it's stupid<br/>
I'm sorry<br/>
<br/>
And then I walked away<br/>
Thinkin' that she would never talk to me<br/>
Like what were you thinking?<br/>
Bringing up the band<br/>
<br/>
You would have got a better result<br/>
If would have just beat her up and ran<br/>
You shouldn't have worn your glasses<br/>
Take your shirt up out your pants<br/>
See, now it's all over<br/>
And you won't get another chance, damn<br/>
<br/>
I was so close to her<br/>
Then I felt a hand on my shoulder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Girl Talking To Lupe]</i><br/>
She said I know you're not the coolest<br/>
But I swear you are the cutest<br/>
<br/>
And I know you played the tuba<br/>
I seen you at the recital<br/>
It takes a lot to get up there and embarrass yourself<br/>
But you shouldn't put down you should merit yourself<br/>
<br/>
That's just mean you not a punk<br/>
I like the loneliest monk<br/>
Hest the wallpaper on my computer<br/>
I love final fantasy<br/>
<br/>
I hate first person shooters<br/>
(Me too)<br/>
Meteora was nice but I bought Hybrid Theory twice<br/>
Half of tha cheerleading squad is in the stouper<br/>
<br/>
Tha only reason I do it 'cause of my mother<br/>
Took state when she was a junior<br/>
And she want me to du tha same so I'm like naw<br/>
I wanna be an oncologist and diagnose tumors<br/>
<br/>
I gotta a pet parrot his name is Mister Tuna<br/>
My favorite food is fish<br/>
Remember that for the future<br/>
My IM name is Miss Luana, you can hit me after six<br/>
(How you feelin' right now?)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes<br/>
Come see more, we have things to do<br/>
(How you feelin' right now?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Talking]</i><br/>
And just like everything in life<br/>
Things grow<br/>
People grow<br/>
And people grow apart<br/>
It's like some things....<br/>
Were just never meant to be.....you see<br/>
But...then again<br/>
Maybe some things are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
Hold it Now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lupe Talking With Parents]</i><br/>
You know today gonn' be the coolest<br/>
And you know how far your school is<br/>
Know how dangerous the flu is so button up your coat<br/>
And finish off your breakfast<br/>
You know how important fuel is<br/>
Food is to humans as buoyancy's to boat<br/>
I knew this<br/>
Everyday we gotta go through this<br/>
And I ask why you quote.."Cause I'm your father Lucas"<br/>
Pop last night I was looking over the futures<br/>
Commodities is failing<br/>
Rental properties is selling<br/>
The bio-tech marketshare is at its hugest<br/>
I think we should ride this wave<br/>
We can't reinvent the rubix<br/>
WOH!!!<br/>
We should of played her more music<br/>
Lucas dear why's your bookbag full of tulips<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Talking to Mother]</i><br/>
Who are these flowers for?<br/>
Well ma, see theres this girl<br/>
And I was thinking I might walk to her<br/>
You know talk to her<br/>
Discuss different things that would talk to her<br/>
And see what makes her tick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
Hey!!! Yeah<br/>
<br/>
You know momma?<br/>
It's funny right?
