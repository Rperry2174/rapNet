<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
What if I said, love was a lie though<br/>
It was more like hate with a eye closed<br/>
And the other eye had the eye rolled<br/>
That's contempt and ignorance, I know<br/>
But what do I know?<br/>
Only thing that I seen was the inside of a blindfold<br/>
And you just as blind as me<br/>
So how I look? Asking you where do I go<br/>
I and I keep high hope alive though<br/>
That loves not a lie it just likes to lie low<br/>
Likes to hide right there in plain sight<br/>
And you got to find it with your eyes, closed<br/>
And in the dark, you see the part, of your partner, that's the heart<br/>
If you die it's like apartheid<br/>
We can bring it back to the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Salim:]</i><br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
No, it's not designed to make you feel love<br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
Oh no, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
On second thought leave apartheid in the grave<br/>
But the heart part, that can be saved<br/>
The hard part's making sure it don't break into little sharp pieces that are hard to replace<br/>
Hard to find spare arteries these days<br/>
In decent shape, and know things decay<br/>
And at these rates you're gon' need to be paid<br/>
Like 3D wage just to see D. Wade<br/>
To the place that sells these parts<br/>
That you couldn't keep safe from the street art<br/>
So why would we waste our art on your mistake?<br/>
When you was driving reckless, didn't pump these brakes<br/>
Hate to have to shoot you down<br/>
A fine running heart makes a soothing sound<br/>
It's junkyard love in your future, pal<br/>
Didn't appreciate it then, bet you do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Salim:]</i><br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, make you feel)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
And in the futuristic love will be reduced to physics<br/>
Computer digits made by robots<br/>
That use statistics, algorithms, and group logistics<br/>
The mood-resistant downloadable thing that's used specific<br/>
Easily updated with few commitments<br/>
Can find it's way home if you forget it<br/>
Say, maybe on a starship tour<br/>
Heard a knock at your starship door<br/>
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar<br/>
Had a dance on the starship floor<br/>
But then you got starship sick<br/>
So you had to run to the starship store<br/>
And then you got those starship pills<br/>
But when you back she wasn't there no more<br/>
She says, "Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store<br/>
Maybe we can take a trip to take a look at the stars around parsec 4"<br/>
And it was the most beautiful thing you both had ever seen in your lives before<br/>
And she pulled out her love, so you reached down in your starsuit for<br/>
But your pockets empty, now the moments passing<br/>
It'll probably never happen like this again<br/>
I guess it didn't work out for you in the end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Salim:]</i><br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)<br/>
Oh, no, baby
