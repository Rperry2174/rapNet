<i>[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it<br/>
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it<br/>
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it<br/>
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Money ain’t shit when there’s wealth next to it<br/>
Wealth ain’t shit when there’s health next to it<br/>
In the lane with nobody else next to it<br/>
Ain’t get here by myself, lot of help next to it<br/>
Word to chilly chill, that’s myself let’s do it<br/>
1st and 15 ent, F&amp;L music<br/>
Out in 05, ain’t nothing let’s do it<br/>
Don’t say my name, unless my city next to it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Anything look good with a bitch next to it<br/>
And if the bitch got a face that’s pretty next to it<br/>
Riding around town something really exclusive<br/>
Bump a little Pac with some Biggie next to it<br/>
That’s love with a twist next to it<br/>
That’s a blood with a crip next to it<br/>
At the Bulls game like a tree gift next to it<br/>
Yes, that’s the flow and I sit next to it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Ty$]</i><br/>
Everybody look better with a chick, let’s do it<br/>
Rollie with a wrist next to it<br/>
Top down on a whip that’s roofless<br/>
Let’s do it<br/>
Club ain’t turned less some womens into it<br/>
It’s the chicks that do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Crib ain’t shit ‘less a whip next to it<br/>
Whip ain’t shit ‘less Benz next to it<br/>
But a Benz ain’t shit with a Rari next to it<br/>
Rari ain’t shit with a Zonda next to it<br/>
Really tell a difference when a Honda next to it<br/>
But a Honda is shit when you jogging next to it<br/>
‘Cause this a baby momma with a condom next to it<br/>
‘Cause this a miracle I’m still rockin’ let’s do it<br/>
Still need a comma with a zero next to it<br/>
Then another comma with a zero next to it<br/>
Then a zero next to it and a zero next to it<br/>
Then another fuckin’ comma then a zero next to it<br/>
What we talkin’ that’s a million, let’s do it<br/>
What we talkin’ that’s a million, let’s do it<br/>
Still at the bottom with a million next to it<br/>
‘Cause a million ain’t shit with a billion next to it
