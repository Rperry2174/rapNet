<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Life styles of the rich and famous<br/>
Bought a big house and a whole lotta rangers<br/>
Fresh new couch and a whole lotta trainers<br/>
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers<br/>
And some Mexican floral arrangers<br/>
A great big TV that'll entertain us<br/>
Some colourful commissions for some high paid painters<br/>
Someone to take the wrap so that I stay stainless<br/>
And a new relationship with a banker <br/>
And two pinky rings for my manicured fingers <br/>
A trained German Shepard that bark when he's angered<br/>
To watch my possessions and to look out for strangers<br/>
And a fifty foot yacht with an anchor <br/>
A young supermodel that should remain nameless<br/>
(The) ups and the downs the sames and the changes<br/>
All the money in the world won't make it painless no...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(But they love it and they love it)<br/>
The more you try to erase me<br/>
(and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more the more<br/>
The more that I appear<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more you try the eraser<br/>
The more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more that you appear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
(Plain Pat, what up?)<br/>
Lifestyles of the broke and famous<br/>
Let you know how crazy this game is<br/>
Look at all the new beautiful faces<br/>
At home supermodel myspaces<br/>
Long for they shot on the tv screen<br/>
American Idol never seen these dreams<br/>
Just last week they wanna see ID<br/>
Now they got you in VIP huh<br/>
How many people almost famous<br/>
You almost remember what they name is<br/>
Like hey didn't you play in<br/>
No it couldn't be quit playin<br/>
Now tryin to keep that balance <br/>
After MTV that's a real world challenge<br/>
Back on that train <br/>
Never to be heard from again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
(but they love it and they love it)<br/>
The more you try to erase me<br/>
The more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more that I appear<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more you try the eraser<br/>
The more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more that you appear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
G R I P P I M P <br/>
I any spell a bitch come on that's me<br/>
I bring a burner sensation to the urban eye <br/>
Like a eye drop of turpentine <br/>
You can listen to the serpent fine <br/>
But the earth got gas once it burps its fine<br/>
Some around me they talk about degrees<br/>
Now GHG how to cook a quart of ki<br/>
Talkin bout nasal he ain't over that cold<br/>
No glove, scrub, man he's just over that stove<br/>
Perfect paradigm wrong place wrong time<br/>
Shoulda been Phizer Glaxo Smith Kline<br/>
Number one chemist look at the no blemish<br/>
Egg shell off white like a DUPONT finish<br/>
Young, dumb, how strong who can handle us?<br/>
I wonder how God's goin paint today's canvases <br/>
Cause who knew that day that man would just<br/>
Go to VA with a tech and spray campuses<br/>
What a way to see the cover of time<br/>
I know that n**** wish he was standing in line<br/>
to see it..as if he didn't do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
(but they love it and they love it)<br/>
The more you try the erase me<br/>
The more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more that I appear<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more you try the eraser<br/>
The more the more (and they love it) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The more that you appear
