<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Roc-A-Fella, 1st AND!!<br/>
Jay... Lupe!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, uhh<br/>
And so it seems that I'm, sewing jeans<br/>
And, 1st and 15 is just a sewing machine<br/>
So I, cut the pattern and I, sew in seams<br/>
And, button in this hustling then publically I'm Buddy Lee<br/>
There's no bustin them and cuffing them is like<br/>
ushering in the regime, they want me to make Prince pants<br/>
But I withstand, I ain't gotten into that<br/>
A little big in the waist, two-pocket on the back<br/>
Call them Nu-vi's, O.G.'s covered in blue dye<br/>
Give 'em the game, that's like giving chocolate to the fat<br/>
Look, how you think I got here?<br/>
That's the same game that came through where I lived as a kid<br/>
in the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back<br/>
Made me a ripper, deliver like river<br/>
Content a little more thicker, slicker<br/>
Yeah, and they said oil and water don't mix<br/>
Now they all down at the beach washing off the fish<br/>
Was Blackbeard 'til I brought the Roc into your ships<br/>
YEAH!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's my life, my life - everything I do I do for you<br/>
I do it all for you - everything I say you know it's the truth<br/>
I'll say it is the truth - I'll take all the pressure of of you<br/>
Take pressure off of you; I'll take, the pressure off of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
YEAH!<br/>
Uhh, it's hella proper (proper)<br/>
Cause it sag so low you can see boxer, like a boxer's<br/>
That's the way that the Family's pants worn<br/>
Then we slide, and try and put 'em on<br/>
The stones in the pocket'll drag you down to Davy Jones locker<br/>
Beware if you wanna Roc the Knickerbocker<br/>
Other nigga from the block what, they was selling O's<br/>
like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine<br/>
just to feel important, it was +Do or Die+<br/>
They was tired of being "Po' Pimps," now for sure<br/>
That was just a product of my common sense<br/>
I guess, I was just guessing like the consonants<br/>
Momma said beware of what the devil do<br/>
Tell 'em that your soul's not for sale like the W's<br/>
So go ahead and pirate, the highest<br/>
cannons make you leak like pirated my shh..<br/>
It's no shh.. it's just shh like quiet<br/>
And big homey's out of retirement<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, Young, uhh<br/>
So the pen is mightier than the sword my lord<br/>
My first picture was a line-up, now I'm on the Forbes<br/>
And I still remain the artiste through thees all<br/>
If you force my hand I'll be forced to "draw"<br/>
If the war calls for Warhols<br/>
Hope you got enough space on your hall's walls<br/>
I make niggaz murals, then escape the bureau's<br/>
investigation, out in Europe on vacation<br/>
I'm back for these puppies with the pound boy<br/>
(Blaow) Here's a round boy (blaow blaow) down boy<br/>
Sound boy, you don't wanna soundclash loud noise<br/>
leave niggaz paranoid if not paralyzed<br/>
Which means you can't walk in my shoes<br/>
Too much green you can't talk in my hue<br/>
Extend the team, nigga holla at Lu'<br/>
1st and 15th, that's my cue, I'm through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
