"The international community struggles<br/>
To get help into Haiti following<br/>
The worst disaster in United Nations history<br/>
Amidst the frustration and chaos<br/>
Surrounding the humanitarian efforts on the ground<br/>
There have been some miraculous rescues"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kenna]</i><br/>
Like a phoenix<br/>
From its ashes<br/>
We will rise<br/>
Follow angels<br/>
Into heavens<br/>
We will rise<br/>
Nothing's gonna take you down<br/>
We are everlasting now<br/>
We are everlasting now, now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco (Kenna)]</i><br/>
Now I've been shaken<br/>
But I'm not broken<br/>
I won't be braking<br/>
Anytime<br/>
I have fallen<br/>
But I'm not ruined<br/>
I'll keep on moving<br/>
Into my<br/>
Resurrection<br/>
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)<br/>
Resurrection<br/>
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Urgency, emergency among us<br/>
Life is in the crisis, tragedy's upon us<br/>
And we won't leave you stranded<br/>
Rapidly we cometh<br/>
To take you out the darkness<br/>
Show you where the sun is<br/>
Cries from the rubble<br/>
Are the voices this is sung with<br/>
And those that have stopped singing<br/>
We can still hear you under it<br/>
Right up out your worrying<br/>
Right into the wondrous<br/>
Right up off the ground<br/>
Right to where the thunder is<br/>
And it's where your sisters<br/>
And your mothers and your brothers is<br/>
Aunties and your friends<br/>
and your fathers and your husbads is<br/>
Watching with the rest of the world in astonishment<br/>
Live from up above, us via news coverage<br/>
Seen even more than the misery that happens is<br/>
The love, the strength, the history, the passion<br/>
The courage of an impoverished people<br/>
That the world once abandoned<br/>
Shining, infinite everlasting now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco (Kenna)]</i><br/>
Now I've been shaken<br/>
But I'm not broken<br/>
I won't be braking<br/>
Anytime<br/>
I have fallen<br/>
But I'm not ruined<br/>
I'll keep on moving<br/>
Into my<br/>
Resurrection<br/>
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)<br/>
Resurrection<br/>
Into my resurrection<br/>
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)<br/>
Resurrection<br/>
Into my resurrection<br/>
Resurrection<br/>
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)<br/>
Resurrection<br/>
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)<br/>
We pray every prayer we know<br/>
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kenna]</i><br/>
We will rise up<br/>
We will rise up<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh<br/>
We will rise up<br/>
We will rise up<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh<br/>
We will rise up<br/>
We will rise up<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh<br/>
We will rise up<br/>
