If I wasn't rappin' I probably be wrastlin'<br/>
Hand to hand grapplin' on the corner of Madison<br/>
Or real-estating, trying to sell you a mansion<br/>
Or rollerblading doing 360 flat spins<br/>
Or I'd probably be flipping the burger<br/>
Attempting a murder paralyzed sippin' on Gerber<br/>
I could be working at jewels, chain snatching<br/>
Jerking your jewels, homeless working for food<br/>
I might be cleaning your pool, teaching your school, preaching to fools<br/>
Leeching, smoking weed to be cool<br/>
At DMVs holding lines up<br/>
Or wind up in line ups, my time's up<br/>
Full of holes in a hole in a fine tux<br/>
Out on parole, out of control, holding your dime up<br/>
I could be lazy sitting on your couch<br/>
Or I could be crazy cussing pigeons out<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all<br/>
<br/>
Could be thanking the academy<br/>
Friend of the family, your man delivering bail<br/>
Or I could be the man that delivers your mail<br/>
Or I could be taking the stand drinking on L<br/>
This could be my third life, my third strike<br/>
Or my third wife been garbage on my first mic<br/>
I could've got off easy, that nigga deserves life<br/>
Or the Orkin man searching for termites<br/>
I could Be sticking up convenience stores<br/>
Or twisting up what you fiending for<br/>
Or gettin' bucked with the meanest hoes<br/>
Been giving up, on top of building leaning forward, with no wings to soar it<br/>
It could've kidnapped my daughters<br/>
Been extorted for a couple of Porsches<br/>
I might be drunk from Moe stumblin' slow<br/>
Someone you know, running the show, or shoveling snow<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all<br/>
<br/>
I could be starting guarding, or planting the garden, or security guarding<br/>
Or I could be starving and eating out your garbage<br/>
And found stardom and starring in sitcoms with Martin<br/>
I could've been marching with Martin<br/>
Handcuff, nullface, over the face with no comment<br/>
I might not even be dark-skinned<br/>
I might not even be conscious, comatose when I overdose<br/>
A R&amp;B singer blowing the notes<br/>
A tailor sewing the coat, a sailor rowing the boat<br/>
I could've, boxed a little fought for the title<br/>
Lost, and lost my vitals on the way to the hospital<br/>
I could've lost my business<br/>
Won the lotto and lost my ticket<br/>
I could be the last one to cross the finish<br/>
Shit, I could be you, I could be him, he could be me, we all got a job<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all<br/>
<br/>
I could be hustlin' bags<br/>
Strugglin' bad<br/>
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit<br/>
I just might be cuttin' your grass<br/>
Walkin' your dog, pumpin' your gas<br/>
Or nothin' at all
