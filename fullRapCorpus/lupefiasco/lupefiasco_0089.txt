Look Up in the Sky.<br/>
Look Up in the Sky.<br/>
Look Up in the Sky<br/>
You thought I was down.<br/>
You thought I was gone.<br/>
Thought I wasn't around.<br/>
You thought I left you alone.<br/>
But look Up in the Sky.<br/>
Just look Up in the Sky.<br/>
See that I'm everywhere<br/>
Everywhere<br/>
Shining Down on You.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Well, well<br/>
Is that our little author?<br/>
Coming back, humming his hymns a little altered<br/>
Your attention, Put back on the flow like the department of water<br/>
Taken off of the door like little Walter<br/>
Chess? Yes. Baby I'm Jerry Lawler<br/>
Rebel with a cause; Outlaw with the lawyer<br/>
Judge jury like a loop, Rap name Lupe, but my daddy named me Warrior<br/>
This is his memorial.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You thought I was down.<br/>
You thought I was gone.<br/>
Thought I wasn't around.<br/>
That I left you alone.<br/>
But Look Up in the Sky.<br/>
Just look Up in the Sky.<br/>
See that I'm everywhere<br/>
Everywhere<br/>
Shining Down on You.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
No, I ain't the nigga trying to get a liquor line<br/>
When I be scriptin lines, Won't this petition sign<br/>
It says I'm sick of dimes, Sick of this prison time<br/>
I really love my people. I'm sick of pimping mine.<br/>
Now if we autotune that shit,<br/>
We can hear the songs from that opera room fat bitch<br/>
Tell em' it's not to pursue it, just shoe it like a blacksmith<br/>
We're trapped, and movin round in circles like it's chap stick<br/>
And that's the semi-circle way of thinking that we're chapped with<br/>
We'll rap is arounded ya head like the bandana's fabulous used to wrap his hats with<br/>
Rather being feds instead of National Geographic's<br/>
Well I'm not having it, naw.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Thought I was down.<br/>
Thought I was gone.<br/>
Thought I was around.<br/>
I left you alone.<br/>
Look Up in the Sky.<br/>
Just look Up in the Sky.<br/>
See that I'm everywhere<br/>
Everywhere<br/>
Shining Down on You.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So, I say hello and this is for the third time<br/>
To everybody out there who ain't never heard mine<br/>
And if you haven't you know you ain't never heard line<br/>
Lu don't MOO. No COW WORDS (cowards(cow-herds)]</div>]
