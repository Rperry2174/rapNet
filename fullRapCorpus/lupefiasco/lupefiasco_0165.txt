<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Chilli sauce on the Panda<br/>
Chow mein be redder than Santa<br/>
Ferrari got spots in Santana<br/>

Teriyaki, Panda, bigger plate, Panda<br/>
Wait in the line I got manners<br/>
I work with them chop sticks like Daniel<br/>
Teriyaki, Panda, orange chicken, Panda<br/>
Honey walnut Panda, express myself, Panda<br/>
I know it I don't need no samples<br/>
I'm a professional don't need examples, no<br/>
That sweet fire chicken bananas<br/>
Might have me dancing like Hammer<br/>
Chilli sauce on the Panda<br/>
Chow mein be redder than Santa<br/>
Ferrari got spots in Santana<br/>
Driver like Juelz Santana<br/>
Teriyaki, Panda, bigger plate, Panda<br/>
Wait in the line I got manners<br/>
I work with them chop sticks like Daniel<br/>
Teriyaki, Panda, orange chicken, Panda<br/>
Honey walnut Panda, express myself, Panda<br/>
I know it I don't need no samples<br/>
I'm a professional don't need examples<br/>
That sweet fire chicken bananas<br/>
Might have me dancing like Hammer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
I mean you go in there with like 15 dollars, you get you a whole meal<br/>
I don't be messing with the fizzies though, I might get me a Aquafina or maybe like the Oceanspray<br/>
Drogas, Drogas, Drogas, Drogas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I used to drop bands at Philippe's<br/>
I let you see the receipts<br/>
They even gave me a jacket<br/>
But I take it back to the streets<br/>
A tray cause I'm taking a seat<br/>
Or I might take it straight to the Jeep<br/>
You flex if your Ex got a drive thru<br/>
Niggas don't hate when you eat<br/>
Fortune cookie told me my future<br/>
Said that I'm gonna be super<br/>
It said that I'm gonna be super<br/>
As long as I don't do nothing stupid<br/>
Old shit is classic, it's cougar<br/>
Black man, that anthem that cooler<br/>
Truly I'm Huey, no Aaron McGruder put air in your scuba<br/>
Might take you down to crustaceans<br/>
Might take you down to the depths<br/>
Or go to Dieppe<br/>
Ever rode through Paris on the chair of a scooter?<br/>
Feeling myself I'm the master<br/>
I'm a get money like pastors<br/>
I wanna live in a castle<br/>
Where me and my panda gon rastle<br/>
Dread so I look like a rasta<br/>
My competition imposters<br/>
Diddy way down in Australia<br/>
Ferrari pull up to your Vauxhall<br/>
Mate, my enemy Holden<br/>
Boy my century golden<br/>
I was in China rocking mastermind designer ate the food but this what I told em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
I mean it's aight<br/>
But we got, we got some shit back at the crib<br/>
That's the shit<br/>
You know what I'm saying niggas tryna flex<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Gunshots I make with my mouth, raaah<br/>
Dumb shit, don't say with my mouth, no<br/>
Know that I fuck with the South, yeah<br/>
But really in love with my house<br/>
Back there they treat me like Michael<br/>
Rappers they treat me like Daigo<br/>
Press really think that I'm psycho<br/>
Genius should just be my bible<br/>
Gotta annotate for these dumb niggas, watch out, watch out<br/>
I'm just fooling, boy, I'm just having fun with ya<br/>
Tetsuo was genius smart but when that Drogas drop on your computers<br/>
Fuck Genius boy, you gon need a genius bar, God damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
I mean for like 14, like 11 dollars you can really, you can eat good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
