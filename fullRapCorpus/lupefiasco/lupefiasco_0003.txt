<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
The champ is here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Flow can't be seen<br/>
Like it took one in the face<br/>
I'm heavy nigga, tow can't be seen<br/>
Like I'm repossessing a Chevy nigga<br/>
Don't hang with those niggas those can't be safe<br/>
Even in they panic rooms<br/>
I will soon be forest to the floor of this<br/>
Stethoscope to the door of it<br/>
Listenin for the break<br/>
And I don't care how long gettin the combination takes<br/>
I be concentrating on the crack, get it straight<br/>
I was so high up the food chain that which I mentioned before<br/>
I ain't know how to make<br/>
I master shake like Aqua Teen Hunger Force<br/>
Already number one in the hood, G<br/>
It's like my third deal off Could Be<br/>
Get it focused, one of the coldest you gonna run across<br/>
Like it was stolen from a under boss<br/>
Spent for stack and sold to another boy<br/>
He might never get it back<br/>
So whoever got it getting whacked if they ever get caught<br/>
Now that's what I call reaction to a chain snatching<br/>
Game got bout as much compassion as The Passion<br/>
So it gotta make a comeback, just like a champion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I run it back to that last piece of action<br/>
My necklace was took-en by detective<br/>
I don't stress it I just gather up my essence<br/>
As real as the view through my Cartier correctives, yeah<br/>
But now back to the punchin<br/>
Back to floor/flow like crunching<br/>
Got a 6 pack on the low now I'm sunk in<br/>
Look like I'm driving from the back seat<br/>
With a bird shotgun like I'm hunting<br/>
You see what happened<br/>
I made a call, and she got fly<br/>
I was pumping, hit her up<br/>
Then I sent my dog to go and pick her up<br/>
Camouflaged fitted cut to the left velours, how I did it up<br/>
And to the whole Westside, I tip it up<br/>
And over to the single baby mama with no job that gotta WIC it up<br/>
To all my niggas in the CCDOC waiting on they quick collect to come<br/>
So they can live it up<br/>
And to my niggas that liquor they livers up and distribute cut in the belly<br/>
Sit it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
In the abdomen is Madison from which I came<br/>
But this my gang<br/>
FNF crew, first and fifteen<br/>
Bear arms like Labatt Blue<br/>
Oh yes its bullets in the toasters as many as the clips that the gun hold<br/>
And they itchin to come up out the magazine like the posters that unfold<br/>
So my heat like Tigerbeat<br/>
I got the shotgun and the driver's seat<br/>
So if Lupe's a coupe, my man is a sedan<br/>
If there's more than 2 of us, then you up against a van<br/>
If I'm leavin, then you leavin<br/>
If your niggas wanna come, y'all can ride with me<br/>
It's just gonna be a lot of squeezin<br/>
Ya understand?<br/>
That I don't need Caroline calculator to divide defeat<br/>
Just lean a little closer<br/>
The flows are his as roses is<br/>
So override your pride and decide retreat<br/>
It's suicide to meet<br/>
Like a broke stock broker and a sidewalk<br/>
Y'all niggas ain't fly as me<br/>
That's why I defy physics and y'all niggas collidin, peace<br/>
I'm up here with the Leers<br/>
Y'all down down there with the airs<br/>
Emperors in the mirror, you're playing with a pair<br/>
Nigga I is we<br/>
Twice the MC like mc-squared<br/>
Trust, I make it relate<br/>
I got the poker-face and I'm hiding a flush<br/>
Still riding the beat<br/>
With a air that still smells like roses from Andre 3000<br/>
My housing surroundings is what made me me<br/>
And that's two times the G<br/>
You see how I doubled that the third time, nigga please<br/>
<br/>
