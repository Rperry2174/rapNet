FlyLo, Lupe, I go<br/>
<br/>
Metabolize on the scattered snare<br/>
With the banana pies that he don't like<br/>
Like mosquito bites on the shins or ankles<br/>
In the end it bends<br/>
Let's begin and pretend it's tranquil<br/>
Upset stomach on the boat to Lucerne to see the lion<br/>
Carved in the wall by the pond<br/>
To commemorate the soldier dying over old divines<br/>
Ergo sum empire, not the inch but the entire<br/>
More pills mean more spills by the whore house with the extra door<br/>
To let the divorced out with force<br/>
And other course routes, of course<br/>
Cleopatra speaking patois with a mouth full of that jerk chicken<br/>
With rum in hand for the curse lifting<br/>
Onion bread with the shine to it<br/>
It's up and fair to define stupid<br/>
But she ain't dumb, at least she know that he ain't fun<br/>
And neither's Europe, even to the Middle Eastern tourists<br/>
Where oil is spent by the drum load<br/>
How many millionaires can the slums hold?<br/>
Potentially all of us, this whole plane and all the bus<br/>
As juggernauts bust through a wall of trust<br/>
You strain to see through the fog of dust<br/>
Like spaghetti for the meatballs<br/>
Of dust Parmesan immaculates<br/>
Head over heels like a back is flipped<br/>
The Japanese don't perceive Atlantaness<br/>
Love labors, get her backstage like the judge chambers<br/>
Everyone under the sun loves hugs from a young stranger<br/>
Or do us, oh foo us<br/>
On boats in the Bay of Pigs<br/>
Runaways wait with the wayward kids<br/>
And the underpaid slaves from Jamaican gigs<br/>
Don't shoe us, cause we ain't Bush<br/>
We ain't hoofs don't boo us cause we ain't cooked<br/>
But who else could hook the fufu up<br/>
In this book I mean, dumplings with dark continents<br/>
Dumb things even bar common sense<br/>
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes a terpin intertwines with the turbans<br/>
Vines with turbans and removes the minds of serpents<br/>
Detergents, deterrents and permits, to build a hut<br/>
Twerk team, Operation Build-a-Butt<br/>
Great like Gildersleeve<br/>
As a king breathes through a silver sieve<br/>
Jack and Jill ain't up that hill enough<br/>
Filtering lean through a gold grill<br/>
Theorize things from swole hills<br/>
They came became what that po' kills<br/>
Throw ho drills on that hotel, that'll oil spill<br/>
Looking at space from a submarine<br/>
Putting that bass in the club machine<br/>
Pushing that cake till it mush in that face ain't no love between<br/>
Fancy ass man wearing glove and rings<br/>
Flying round town in a tub of wings<br/>
Found out how to make love to fiends<br/>
He mixing that fudge with the drug of dreams<br/>
She too teenage to have a drug of choice<br/>
But she fuck with that Royce like she love Detroit<br/>
She rollin'<br/>
(Pharaoh, pharaoh)
