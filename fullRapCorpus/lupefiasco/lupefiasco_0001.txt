<i>[Lupe talking:]</i><br/>
Grew up in Chicago, West side, gang lifestyle, the drug scene, the whole.. it's like one whole universe of insanity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Before I start, like to make sure I’m smart<br/>
Gather my composure, rather my swagger and my culture<br/>
Pivot my fitted, then begin to rivet, with a change of lyric<br/>
In other words, I reposition how I sit it<br/>
Then make you feel it like I mispronounced "filet"<br/>
On second thought, I can't make you fill it<br/>
Like you digging your own grave, unless you can Kill Bill it<br/>
A night of the living passed away<br/>
Can you dig it? Why Emcee? Hey<br/>
I do it for my village<br/>
The pennin' is John Lennon, the beat is the Beatles<br/>
Go together like Lenin and the people<br/>
In some fresh linens and some John Lennon’s fresh outta Seagle's<br/>
The pen and the needles...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Writing and mumbling upcoming verse]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm back at cha, and I Pac like cap backwards<br/>
Like a hat's backwards, you know, when the bats backwards<br/>
Yeah, like a bat catchers<br/>
The law gotta long arm like a back scratcher<br/>
But before I leave mine at home<br/>
Like a bad catcher, I think about my zone<br/>
Where pimps make scratch off the track like a DJ<br/>
Easy, that’s my zone rappers<br/>
It's my deck<br/>
And if I catch u set trippin’ wit my cassette sittin’ in a zone rappers:<br/>
It's not a threat<br/>
Cuz it'll span ya where I roam rappers, where I hone my skills<br/>
They wanna send me back home the devil, is on my heels<br/>
The writing is Sting, liken the sequences, the Police, I repeat<br/>
We go together like the Beauty and the Beast<br/>
Writing is in my veins;<br/>
The ink is the diesel, the pen and the needles…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Writing and mumbling upcoming verse]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
The word is mightier than the sword<br/>
And my serve is tightier than yours<br/>
Like year in St. Louis ya whole flow<br/>
I fear I sank through it...<br/>
It all became clear<br/>
Like a paramedic with an electric chest kit, YEAH<br/>
The gravity of the vocabulary is a caliber equal to Excalibur<br/>
Swung wit the grace of Agassi in his amateurs, THERE<br/>
There was a deeper depth, don't know how I got here<br/>
I also had a hole in my flow<br/>
It appears I sank to it...<br/>
My swing, it couldn’t be seen<br/>
I apply some paint to it, the invisible man<br/>
Wrapped in bandages, in critical, CLEAR<br/>
The scriptin' of Scorsese the score is Count Basie<br/>
We go together like, the original and the sequel<br/>
This is the end of the trilogy, ya feelin’ me?<br/>
The pen and the needles...
