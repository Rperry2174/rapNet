I see, diamond flooded demons, Lamborghini angels<br/>
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through<br/>
Windows up, system bumping, you the one they sang to<br/>
Same two, who said they the ones you should send your thanks through<br/>
Pockets full of blessings, they can sanctify and saint you<br/>
You can hear them revving/reverend up in heaven now, can't you?<br/>
Sandals made of chrome, his soul made of leather<br/>
An engine full of sinning and candy painted feathers<br/>
The sound of the motor only revving/reverend you confess to<br/>
I see this all in the eyes of the girl I'm next to<br/>
I asked her "Where we going?" and she just told me "Pleasure"<br/>
Hands on the wheel and her heels on the acceler-<br/>
-rator, told her wait up, she kept going like et cetera<br/>
But like a broken record, weâ€™ve come too far to just wheel it back selector<br/>
So we going ride forever, forever, forever, forever, forever<br/>
<br/>
Uh, said she was a fan of mine<br/>
Knew she was New Jersey, but said that she was Anaheim<br/>
Butterflies turn to suicides, now it's phantoms flying<br/>
Used to whisper in my ear, but now she trying to Vander mine<br/>
That holy feeling/Holyfield all gone, slowly feeling all wrong<br/>
None of this is satisfying, pull it over, let me out<br/>
I'll just hitchhike back to mine<br/>
Nothing's really as it seems, yeah I should of known that<br/>
Thought I called a angel, devils had my phones tapped
