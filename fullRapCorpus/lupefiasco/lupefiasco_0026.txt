Once upon a time<br/>
At the foot of a great mountain<br/>
There was a town where the people known as happy folk lived<br/>
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world<br/>
Obscured as it was by great clouds<br/>
Here they played out their peaceful lives<br/>
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence<br/>
That was growing in the world below<br/>
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called monkey was enough<br/>
Then one day, strange folk arrived in the town<br/>
They came in camouflage<br/>
Hidden behind dark glasses<br/>
And no one noticed them<br/>
They only saw shadows<br/>
You see<br/>
Without the truth of the eyes<br/>
The happy folk were blind
