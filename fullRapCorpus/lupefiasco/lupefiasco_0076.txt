<i>[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Things are getting outta control<br/>
Feels like I'm running out of soul<br/>
You are getting too heavy to hold<br/>
Think I'll be letting you go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured<br/>
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit<br/>
A shelf full of awards<br/>
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life<br/>
When I see my own self I wonder if we still see a light<br/>
We was tight seeing lights<br/>
Speaking right and breathing life<br/>
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night<br/>
I don't get high life keep me at a decent height<br/>
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights<br/>
Exhausted. Trying to fall asleep. Losses at my recent fights<br/>
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down<br/>
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
I'm begging me don't let me go<br/>
We vow like the letter "Oh"<br/>
To never go our separate ways<br/>
And spin-off into separate shows<br/>
Tired of all the wardrobe changin'<br/>
Playing all these extra roles<br/>
Filled with all these different spirits<br/>
Livin' off these separate souls<br/>
Point in life is getting hollow<br/>
Can't wait for the exit hole<br/>
Give me room. The entry room. Let me in and let me go<br/>
So I can roam around this wilderness<br/>
See it for what it really is<br/>
I'm prepared to filter list<br/>
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree<br/>
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy<br/>
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny<br/>
I can see the lasers shootin' out of you and me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel like the worldâ€”<br/>
Sometimes I feel like the world is against me<br/>
And everything that I've done before<br/>
I swear we used to be so pure<br/>
But we can't be in love no more<br/>
Cause I don't wanna fight this war<br/>
But when I put down my gun<br/>
I turn around and pick up one<br/>
This uzi weighs a ton, but I think I'm done!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Sarah Green]</i><br/>
Think I'll be letting you go<br/>
Things are getting outta control<br/>
Said, it feels like I'm running out of soul<br/>
You're getting heavy to hold<br/>
I think I'll be letting you go<br/>
...Letting you go
