<i>[MDMA:]</i><br/>
There's only 2 ways out of here<br/>
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here forever<br/>
There's only 2 ways out of here<br/>
One's through the door, the other's through me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Sometimes living in a world like this<br/>
It's pretty hard not to go insane<br/>
Not pretty if you don't comply<br/>
Pretty easy if you don't complain<br/>
Stand there like you don't feel pain<br/>
No tears in the face of defeat<br/>
Pretend til the end that you don't fear change<br/>
Don't admit that your faith is weak<br/>
Don't say that you feel like dying<br/>
Life's hard then it feels like diamonds<br/>
Your home's just far too gone<br/>
Much too late to even feel like trying<br/>
Can't understand what I'm saying<br/>
Can't figure out what I'm implying<br/>
If you feel you don't wanna be alive<br/>
You feel just how I am<br/>
I'm on the dark side<br/>
And you can't come find him<br/>
How when it's light all around you<br/>
Yeah, But it's dark all inside him<br/>
No winners when it's me against me<br/>
One of us just ain't gonna survive<br/>
My heart been broke for a while<br/>
Your's been the one keepin' me alive<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
This world is such a fucked up place<br/>
My mind's such a fucked up shape<br/>
Everything down here sucks<br/>
Maybe what's up there is great<br/>
We all gotta go one day<br/>
I just wanna cut to the chase<br/>
I wanna stop these nightmares<br/>
I just wanna touch your face<br/>
All you see is all my feats (feets)<br/>
All I see is all my flaws<br/>
All I hear is all my demons<br/>
Even through your applause<br/>
All you see is all my flights<br/>
Well all I see is all my falls<br/>
All you see is all my rights<br/>
All I see is all my wrongs<br/>
Door, keep telling me to fight<br/>
Gun on my table telling me to come on<br/>
Telling me to to put him inside my hand<br/>
Then put it up right next to my dome<br/>
Door keep telling me to find a reason<br/>
Anything to keep me from squeezing<br/>
Simplest things, yea you really like summer<br/>
You really like music, you really like reading<br/>
Love!<br/>
I can't win if it's me against me<br/>
One of us ain't gonna survive<br/>
And my heart been broke for a while<br/>
Yours been the one keepin' me alive<br/>
Yours been the one keepin' me alive<br/>
Yours been the one keepin' me alive<br/>
<br/>
