This one for the hood!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
What do you do when it's so unequal?<br/>
Wear Michael Jordan's with your tuxedos<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Yea, yea<br/>
It's "hood" now<br/>
Public school system only teaching parts<br/>
So the school of hard knocks is what make you street smart<br/>
You're hood now<br/>
Hood now<br/>
Yea, yea<br/>
Hood now<br/>
Open fire hydrant 'front the liquor store<br/>
Kool and perm ads all on the billboards<br/>
You in the hood now<br/>
You in the hood now<br/>
That's right<br/>
You in the hood now<br/>
Ramen noodle soups, you make the best<br/>
Water in the milk to make it stretch<br/>
That's the hood now<br/>
That's the hood now<br/>
That's the hood now<br/>
That's the hood now<br/>
Ivy League was running really well then<br/>
They slipped up and let Cornel in<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Yes it is<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
In Miami Beach, it's rich white folks<br/>
But Memorial Day, "you know who" do the most<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Yea, it's hood now<br/>
And house shoes is for the house fool<br/>
The homies wear 'em out, how cool<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
That's hood now<br/>
Oh yea, that's hood now<br/>
And that Mercedes Benz, on them giant rims<br/>
Open up the trunk and see 'bout twenty ten's<br/>
That's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
That's hood now<br/>
Oh yea, that's hood now<br/>
And diamond chains was for kings and queens<br/>
But since we got to 'em they'll never be the same<br/>
They hood now<br/>
They hood now<br/>
Bling, Bling<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
You pissed her off, you broke the rules<br/>
Her earrings out, she taking off her shoes<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's about to be...<br/>
Really hood now<br/>
Chop up Jazz, loop up the Rock<br/>
Sample the Blues, call it Hip-Hop<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Yea mayne<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
We took that hurt, made it into songs<br/>
God bless the child that's got his own<br/>
Sayin' it's hood now<br/>
Sayin' it's hood now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Pants saggin' right off my ass<br/>
I sit it down, right in first class<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Fancy restaurant, dress code<br/>
T-shirt, gym shorts<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Hallelujah<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Fashion shows, with fancy clothes<br/>
You see Mr. West right in the front row<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
That's what it means<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
At the Oscar's, P on the sticks<br/>
And the winner is… Three-6<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Uh oh…<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
We took that hurt, made it into songs<br/>
God bless the child that's got his own<br/>
Sayin' it's hood now<br/>
Sayin' it's hood now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
You had Elvis Presley and he was crackin'<br/>
But guess what? Here comes Michael Jackson<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
That's right<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Pro sports, them was yo' courts<br/>
But you let us in, so on and so forth<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Uh huh<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
They gave us scraps, some of it old<br/>
We cooked it up and called it "soul"<br/>
It's good now<br/>
It's good now<br/>
You like that?<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
And you know me, I don't vote<br/>
But the White House, you already know<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
It's hood now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

God bless the child that's got his own<br/>
Sayin' it's hood now<br/>
Sayin' it's hood now<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
You know I had to do it<br/>
Can't forget where you came from<br/>
One for the ghetto<br/>
Two for the hood<br/>
Three for the all<br/>
Four for the good<br/>
<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
And we out<br/>
This the great<br/>
I mean, God is Great<br/>
American Rap<br/>
Food and Liquor 2… through
