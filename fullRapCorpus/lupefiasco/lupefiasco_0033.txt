<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Uhh, Food &amp; Liquor<br/>
Yeah, my man said he wanted somethin real..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
Somethin he could recognize, somethin he could feel..<br/>
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
Baby girl said she was in the mood for somethin real..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
Somethin that could make her move<br/>
Somethin she could feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
<br/>
Lusssst... sometimes can override trusssst<br/>
She said that's why she gave it up<br/>
My man said blood spilled out of everything he tou-chhhhed<br/>
He crushed everything he crushed<br/>
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted to rushhhhh<br/>
Blamed it on the times bein rough<br/>
Doin dirt, with the devil, chasin after the dusssst<br/>
Make a fussss, if it's them, but we hushhh, if it's us<br/>
<br/>
That's why, my momma said she wanted somethin REAL..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
Somethin she could be proud of, somethin she could FEEL..<br/>
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
She said they so used to not havin nuttin real..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
That they don't know how to act<br/>
They don't know how to feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
<br/>
Lifffffe... ain't meant to come around twiiiice<br/>
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right<br/>
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it LIFE<br/>
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night<br/>
I mean, I had a dream that, God gave me FLIGHT<br/>
Too fly for my own good so, God gave me plight<br/>
If I wake up in the mornin now I gotta give 'em SIGHT<br/>
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, sho' you right<br/>
<br/>
The game is not to give 'em nuttin REAL..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
Nothin they could use, nuttin that they could FEEL..<br/>
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's REAL..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
So that's all that they a-know<br/>
That's all that they a-feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
<br/>
Struggle... yeah yeah, another sign that God love you<br/>
Cause on the low, bein po', make you humble<br/>
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep them out of trouble<br/>
Cause bein po', also teach you how to hustle<br/>
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble<br/>
Now that I got my own, I can hit them with a couple<br/>
Couple, my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you<br/>
That's my plan, if I can, on the man, up above you<br/>
<br/>
That's why, I gotta give 'em somethin REAL..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
Somethin they could recognize, somethin they could FEEL..<br/>
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em somethin real..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
Somethin that'll make 'em stop<br/>
Somethin they can feel.. feel.. feel.. feel<br/>
<br/>
Yo! For real, really real, yeah!<br/>
Know what it is, woo!<br/>
Baby girl said she was in the mood for somethin REAL..<br/>
real.. real.. real.. real<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sarah Green - to fade]</i><br/>
So real.. so real..
