<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
At my brother's Janazah<br/>
Tears stained sunglassses<br/>
A Salat with no bows<br/>
Pallbearer carry you to the car now<br/>
Chilly day, Mosque on 96 and 3rd<br/>
New York City way, me and Jay never left my side<br/>
Rest like that picture with your pride<br/>
Who look just like..<br/>
Now the city looks less bright<br/>
Brooklyn looking less special<br/>
Don't carry the same weight<br/>
As when you were on this level<br/>
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless<br/>
An inspiration and a king<br/>
They won't know what I mean but this one 'bout to spring<br/>
Protect it with every feather on the wings<br/>
So even when it hurts, you'll never feel a thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Said it's a cold cold war<br/>
Ain't nobody wins like the government<br/>
In the U.S.S.R<br/>
Cause this is all for shares<br/>
Nobody cares<br/>
Who you think you are<br/>
And you can fight it, but there's no defense<br/>
For what things are<br/>
Baby grab a jacket<br/>
It's a cold, cold...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Let me clarify the chorus<br/>
And what my cold war is<br/>
Cause the complexity is enormous<br/>
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets<br/>
To reinforce every single word that I talk with<br/>
Something about losing things, human beings<br/>
That reduces things to their most elementary<br/>
Find yourself where you never meant to be<br/>
With the energy of memories<br/>
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me<br/>
Finding pleasure in the pains<br/>
Like finding desert in the rain<br/>
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic<br/>
Question if I'm over it<br/>
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless<br/>
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit<br/>
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it<br/>
Still happy that I opened it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
In the studio writing these words, one after another<br/>
In memorial of my brother<br/>
As you listen to the album with<br/>
Nothing on the cover<br/>
I imagine that he hovers<br/>
In the back of his chair<br/>
Floating right there in the air<br/>
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it<br/>
Ask why do I put myself through this<br/>
Crack a smile, look up at the file<br/>
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean<br/>
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross<br/>
Happy with his dedicated song<br/>
But now he's all gone<br/>
But he was never there, cause<br/>
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here<br/>
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up<br/>
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up<br/>
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies<br/>
Wipes away our cool young histories<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Ride around, you know what I'm saying<br/>
All over the world right? I mean, everywhere<br/>
I mean we just disappear and just come back<br/>
I feel like we can just put him anywhere<br/>
He'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying<br/>
Another random thing's that consequence to me<br/>
But maybe to you, not much<br/>
But with that said, the reason behind me<br/>
Why I do what I does, love<br/>
Just riding around bumping that, uh<br/>
Either Jay or Nas, or me<br/>
I used to tell him like "yeah you alright"<br/>
But you ain't fucking with my man<br/>
It was always like that, so<br/>
Drop a little for you, let it bump<br/>
This that Esco music, it's that Esco music<br/>
Bumping with my Esco music, that raw<br/>
See you on the other side, As-Salamu Alaykum
