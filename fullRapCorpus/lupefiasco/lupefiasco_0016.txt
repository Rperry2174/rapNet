Unh! I bring you murder in the first<br/>
And even as we speak we gettin further in this verse<br/>
With no further adieu I do what I respect<br/>
Doom got me stripes like Hamburgler for my work<br/>
Ask Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa<br/>
Mercy, he's a mess! So immersed in his murk<br/>
He's two thirds submerged below the surface where they surf<br/>
This is where I lay it down like a bird givin birth<br/>
So call me Lu the giant's goose or just, Faberge paint<br/>
Til I'm called back to the shore by the watchers of the bay<br/>
I wait, til I come back like a tsunami<br/>
Never microwave like the watchers of the weight<br/>
I'm wrapped in aluminum foil, I do my dirt like Kwame<br/>
Until that same soil bein pushed into my grave<br/>
But I'm so ahead of my time, the next day<br/>
Might strike oil while I delay, homie I'm so crude<br/>
Texas T, haters is so screwed<br/>
But I can't fill it like a flathead in a Philips<br/>
Don't get it twisted, nigga I'm no tool<br/>
More cool than a pool in a blizzard<br/>
With ice cubes in it during Christmas<br/>
Meanin there's no school, in the misfit<br/>
Like I'm throwin a fit<br/>
Or I just can't fit it, tidbit too big<br/>
It's gotta hem it til it's fresh to death<br/>
Dressed to kill it, like unh!<br/>
<br/>
Unh! 187 on my second, I reckon<br/>
This is an assault with a deadly session<br/>
A soft peace and blessins to the sentence that be reppin<br/>
All across in every direction, locality, and section<br/>
That know Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa<br/>
Give it how I live it most niggaz won't believe<br/>
Or achieve how I did it most niggaz won't recieve<br/>
Til I leave and I bereave the secrets of my sickness<br/>
How I, flooded the streets like Venice<br/>
I've suffered, demanded, withstanded, pimp handed and hustlin<br/>
I'm Colonel Mustard with the speech<br/>
They ain't catchin me, no suspicions of stickin<br/>
No convictions on my rap sheet<br/>
I'm so committin lay my murder game, that's sweet<br/>
Speakeasy like Prohibition, no emission<br/>
If you ain't knockin like me to the underground bar, buryin a toast<br/>
Dodgin the raid like roach, nigga please<br/>
<br/>
Unh! I make it give up the ghost<br/>
On the trifecta, the third, I differ<br/>
Nigga, you ain't heard? My lecture like Lector<br/>
Letcha in on a secret, but you can't leak it<br/>
Lupe's the killa, killa, killa, killa<br/>
Since my entrance, my niggaz had packs<br/>
They moved 'em to a trap like Winston<br/>
Far from bustas, baby nah<br/>
All my homies henchmen<br/>
I was the rhymer, my talk went through the walls like Slimer<br/>
Or like, eatin vagina<br/>
Or, a stray bullet, whichever ways I put it<br/>
Crooks was hooked like crooks through neighborhoods I pushed it<br/>
Little Caesar niggaz pizzas was like book it<br/>
Delivery mean like Leroy Green<br/>
They couldn't take it to the places I took it<br/>
Beware, you don't look it<br/>
You ain't dressed for this affair<br/>
I'm hooded in the bushes like unh!
