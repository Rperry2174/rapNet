<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
When the night falls<br/>
She had to call of the street life<br/>
See the flicker of the street lights<br/>
Wanna know what it be like when it be right... there.<br/>
Black lipstick tattoos of the peace sign<br/>
Plus the mark of the beast sign oh night please be kind<br/>
Baby girl has no... fears.<br/>
Tight clothing<br/>
Blowing cigarette smoke in slow motion<br/>
All full of love potion but its frozen<br/>
Thinks the world´s so insincere<br/>
Now she dancing with strangers<br/>
She don´t know they name no<br/>
The city has claimed her but she doesn´t care<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
What you want want<br/>
What you want want<br/>
Come and get it get it<br/>
What you want want<br/>
What you want want want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
When the night falls<br/>
She had to call of the bright life<br/>
See the shine in the spotlights<br/>
Wanna know what that like when it be right... there.<br/>
White liar put her name in their headlines<br/>
Naked pictures on her website<br/>
Just a rabbit in the headlights<br/>
Baby girl don´t you be ... scared<br/>
Red carpet on the arms of an artist<br/>
Is starlit on the star-less paparazzi target<br/>
Thinks being normal´s just so unfair<br/>
She knows that its dangerous she wants to be famous<br/>
But she´s not ashamed ´cause it ain´t nothing there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
When the day comes<br/>
And they looking far away from where they came from<br/>
See the night has betrayed them told em it would stay young<br/>
Told them they would stay young<br/>
Now they see the sun<br/>
The night´s on the run right before the rise<br/>
Black mascara´s running from their eyes<br/>
But big girls don´t cry<br/>
It´ll be alright<br/>
It´ll be tonight (tonight)<br/>
They´ll cut back on the lies.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
