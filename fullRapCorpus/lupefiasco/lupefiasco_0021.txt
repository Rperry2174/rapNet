<i>[Intro: Unidentified man &amp; Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
<i>[Unidentified man:]</i> So Lu who’s next man? Who's up and coming in the game?<br/>
<i>[Lupe:]</i> Next kid, um, of course my man, um, Gemini, form the south side of Chicago, uh good kid, good MC<br/>
Know what I’m saying, got some fire. For real though, but you’ll see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gemini:]</i><br/>
Gemini<br/>
First and fifteenth niggas<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Uh huh<br/>
Feel me on this one<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I done grew to be a monster<br/>
8 nigga face of a killer<br/>
Addicted to the taste of liquor, so I pray for my liver<br/>
I gotta get up out my mamma’s basement<br/>
She need some more space and I feel her, fuck could I do but take the sweet with the bitter<br/>
On top of that just had a baby delivered<br/>
Child support chasing a nigga<br/>
But I ain’t got no paper to give ‘em<br/>
Water leaking from the cracks of the ceiling<br/>
Couple roaches here and there but they ain’t half as bad as in the beginning<br/>
It’s like they always showed their ass whenever company visit<br/>
And then that black flag splashed ‘em and they finally diminished<br/>
Losing ambition<br/>
Graduated school by inches<br/>
Eating Ramen noodle soup cuz ain’t no food in the kitchen<br/>
Taking baths with the same shit we use with the dishes<br/>
This is unconstitutional to you but I live it<br/>
Could move and distribute but I’m cool cuz I ain’t not trying to do prison<br/>
You couldn’t walk inside my shoes unless you truthfully lived it<br/>
This is far from just some more 'Cago nigga<br/>
With cars and bitches running through Chicago twisting<br/>
This is top flow Picasso picture<br/>
12 car garage door living<br/>
Just better pray them Glock floors don’t<br/>
Why’s my best friend hoping I fail<br/>
Molded him well<br/>
Love him but fuck him<br/>
He can get the bulk of the shells<br/>
I write my life in a notepad and hope that it sells<br/>
Cuz broke or in jail ain't cutting it like coke on the scale<br/>
Get toast by the belt<br/>
Too blind to fucking post it in braille<br/>
Loading my shells I’m focused on a soul who I kill<br/>
No coat shall I tail<br/>
Coasting on this boat that I sail<br/>
I float with the whales<br/>
A free Willy, cannot go to jail<br/>
Cause I swore that I'd be 6 feet in a pine box cold<br/>
Before I let the streets of South Chicago swallow my soul<br/>
I seen too many friends before me choose that horrible road<br/>
Couldn’t harbor the load, froze, and they swallowed ‘em whole<br/>
Until you niggas is probably plotting to rob me and scram<br/>
Just call it quits<br/>
You be dead before you count the first grand<br/>
You may get far as Queen Latifah and the rest of her friends<br/>
You won’t pull a Jada Pinkett, you can trust that fam<br/>
So I'm screaming help me dearly with tears in my pants<br/>
I’ll be found in the cemetery buried next to my grams<br/>
I get dirty like 2 Mexican hands dropping the trans<br/>
Chopping up grams cause me starving is not in the plans<br/>
Motherfucker
