Now Little Terry got a gun he got from the store<br/>
He bought it with the money he got it from his chores<br/>
He robbed the candy shop told her lay down on the floor<br/>
Put the cookies in bag take the pennies out the drawer<br/>
Little Chalil got a gun he got from the rebels to kill the infidels and American devils<br/>
A bomb on his waist a mask on his face prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal<br/>
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad<br/>
That he snuck into school in his black book bag<br/>
His black nail polish black books and black hat<br/>
He gonna' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass<br/>
Little Joker got a gun he bought on the street<br/>
To go and kill the that beat him up last week<br/>
Cause he don't let go of none of his past beefs<br/>
Bullets flying out the window shells landing on the seats<br/>
Little Sarah got a gun from her Uncle Sam<br/>
She got armour piercing rounds and her gun don't jam<br/>
She got lasers got rockets<br/>
She killing to go to college<br/>
She thought it was an insurgent it was some old man<br/>
Now You can get guns on the internet<br/>
AK's, Glocks, Nines, Inatechs,<br/>
So when you see shorty don't disrespect<br/>
Watch Better Tomorrow and play Grand Theft Auto<br/>
Get Back
