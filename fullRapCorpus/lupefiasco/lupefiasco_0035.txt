<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Uh, what up ya'll<br/>
Soundtrack what's poppin' baby<br/>
Ya'll ain't know<br/>
I go by the name of<br/>
Lupe Fiasco<br/>
Representin' that 1st &amp; 15<br/>
Yea<br/>
And this one right here<br/>
I dedicate this one right here<br/>
To all my homies out there grindin' (ya know what I'm saying)<br/>
Legally and Illegally<br/>
Ha<br/>
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout<br/>
So, check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
First got it when he was six<br/>
Didn't know any tricks<br/>
Matter fact<br/>
First time he got on it he slipped<br/>
Landed on his hip and bust his lip<br/>
For a week he had to talk with a lisp<br/>
Like this<br/>
Now we can end the story right here<br/>
But shorty didn't quit it was something in the air<br/>
Yea<br/>
He said it was somethin' so appealing<br/>
He couldn't fight the feelin'<br/>
Somethin' about it<br/>
He knew he couldn't doubt it<br/>
Couldn't understand it<br/>
Brand it, since his first kickflip he land it<br/>
Uh<br/>
Labeled a misfit, abandoned<br/>
Ca-kunk, ca-kunk, kunk<br/>
His neighbors couldn't stand it, so<br/>
He was banished to the park<br/>
Started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark<br/>
Yea<br/>
When he said it's getting late in here<br/>
So "I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast<br/>
And the way he roll just a rebel to the world with no place to go<br/>
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast<br/>
So come and skate with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be<br/>
So let's Kick, and Push, and Coast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uh, uh ,uh<br/>
My man got a lil older became a better roller (yea)<br/>
No helmet, hellbent on killin' himself, was what his momma said<br/>
But he was feelin' himself<br/>
Got a lil more swagger in his style<br/>
Met his girlfriend, she was clappin' in the crowd<br/>
Love is what was happening to him now, uh<br/>
He said I would marry you but I'm engaged to these aerials and varials<br/>
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry 2<br/>
She said bow I weigh 120 pounds, now<br/>
Lemme make one thing clear<br/>
I don't need to ride yours I got mine right here<br/>
So she took him to a spot<br/>
He didn't know about<br/>
Somewhere in the apartment parking lot, she said<br/>
I don't normally take dates in here<br/>
Security came and said "I'm sorry there's no skating here"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast<br/>
And the way they roll just lovers in the twine with no place to go<br/>
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast<br/>
So come and skate with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be<br/>
So let's Kick, (uh uh) and Push, (yea yea) and Coast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Yea uh, yea, yea<br/>
Before he knew he had a crew<br/>
That weren't no punk<br/>
In they Spitfire shirts and SB Dunks<br/>
They would Push, till they couldn't skate no more<br/>
Office building, lobbies weren't safe no more<br/>
And it wasn't like they weren't getting chased no more<br/>
Just the freedom is better than breathing they said (they said)<br/>
And they escape route, they used to escape out<br/>
When things got crazy they needed to break out (they'd head)<br/>
To any place with stairs, any good grinds the world was theirs, uh<br/>
And they four wheels would take them there<br/>
Till the cops came and said "There's no skating here"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast<br/>
And the way they roll just a rebels without a cause with no place to go<br/>
So they Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast<br/>
So come roll with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be<br/>
So let's Kick, (uh uh) and Push, (yea yea) and Coast
