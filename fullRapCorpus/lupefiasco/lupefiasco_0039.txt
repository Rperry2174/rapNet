Uh, Fresh to def she is<br/>
From her steps to the set she is<br/>
So "death" might not let me live<br/>
Ya dig<br/>
Fresh uh huh, yes she is<br/>
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this<br/>
The orchestra in my mind don't play like this (naw),<br/>
But I'm prepared for it<br/>
Got a lil rare for it<br/>
Brushed off my airs<br/>
Even cut my hair for it<br/>
'Cause normally I don't care for it<br/>
Don't even be looking for like, like that<br/>
Then there go it<br/>
Yea right over there so I prepare the poet<br/>
Lil scared my stair lowered<br/>
Momma said have no fear<br/>
Plus I'm already outta my chair<br/>
Gathered up my airs on my square from here forward<br/>
It's nothing right so here go it<br/>
Whisper in her ear "it's kinda crowded in here"<br/>
Would she care to blow it she said "yea"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
You're my sunshine (you're my sunshine),<br/>
You're my moonlight (you're my moonlight),<br/>
You're the starry skies above me won't you please come down and hug me,<br/>
Think I found love in this club tonight (Wowowowo)<br/>
<br/>
Never met her before<br/>
But I think I like her like a metaphor<br/>
It's hard to get in the car we sit<br/>
From the intro she rolled down her window just in case I was a skitzo<br/>
I compliment her on the common sense<br/>
I'm calm<br/>
A lil more confident (Uh Huh)<br/>
And then we lose consciousness<br/>
She says "that I've been waiting for you"<br/>
And I know you've been chasing me too since they kidnapped me from a castle<br/>
I been thinking of you<br/>
I told her "fire breathing dragon he bet not harm me" or he be sorry when he meets my one man army<br/>
And thou has come to rescue me<br/>
My knight in shining armor yes you be<br/>
Woken up by the horn of an SUV<br/>
I said "see, too beautiful to let you sleep"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Relationship is just 30 minutes long<br/>
It's kinda heavy maybe a lil strong<br/>
Gonna take much more than once<br/>
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month<br/>
Or two before I bid you a due<br/>
Do this one thing for me outta the trillions of numbers that's in the world<br/>
Just leave me a few that lead to you<br/>
Won't be longing I see you in the morning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i>
