Pharaoh, pharaoh?<br/>
Pharaoh<br/>
<br/>
Dollar mission, Mississippi masala getting<br/>
Guava Casaba melons, getting a spot at competition<br/>
Titties and teeth, so silly of me, no really, it’s free<br/>
Aye you can use the phone like a new computer wand<br/>
That’s an Ethernet pun, cause dial-up’s all done<br/>
When it took twenty minutes just to download one<br/>
Aye, you got a fine face, also a dime in your behind<br/>
Please can I find some time space to find base<br/>
Kinds of rhymes to describe how you’re designed great<br/>
And maybe remove the mind free<br/>
Like it’s overhead creams at the train yard<br/>
That Tom Cruise used in the War of the World's<br/>
Before the aliens came part<br/>
Remember that, I’m not a fan of the sci-fi<br/>
Like dial-up’s not a fan of the wi-fi<br/>
I’m in your eyes like little reflective little pools of tie-dye<br/>
And it’s 1972 and I’m some long-haired high guy<br/>
Driving a Volkswagen Beetle off into the California twilight<br/>
I usually got top cause I’m a guy right<br/>
But if you’re gay that’s straight too<br/>
Hey, I don’t hate, I got a couple of friends who went bi twice<br/>
Did that arrive right?<br/>
Do you like whole stories or just the highlights<br/>
Cause I like to write your life story on the sky<br/>
Made of Lite Brights, remember those?<br/>
10 years old, let me guess your age<br/>
You were a ten, ten years ago<br/>
Am I right, who you calling?<br/>
Maybe New Orleans<br/>
Where your Mother lives with your brother's kids<br/>
Because he locked up cause<br/>
Of what some other motherfucker did<br/>
Love to fib bout the Fibonacci sequence<br/>
Do you flicker like Liberace Sequins<br/>
Or maybe twinkle like little stars<br/>
And tingle like little scars<br/>
I run a wrinkle with you like a car hood<br/>
And crash test and b-box while we re-rocks<br/>
Saul William’s doing the slam set<br/>
Then wrap like saran over the pan<br/>
Keep the yams fresh, sweet<br/>
Five different songs, over five different beats<br/>
And this one’s called Valley<br/>
I wrote it on the plane in the chair by the galley<br/>
On the way to Cali, chicken in the salad<br/>
Sounds like a ballad<br/>
You loyal, so I’m Khaled<br/>
Buy your momma a palace, scratch that<br/>
Buy your momma what matters<br/>
Data says dollars hotter than two nevadas<br/>
Burning hole in the pockets<br/>
And in the wallets of all the rappers<br/>
Trappers attracting all the yellowbone Instagrammers<br/>
But what about us?<br/>
<br/>
Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh<br/>
<br/>
It burns inside like lactic acid<br/>
Exorcise demons, turn them into gods<br/>
Turning in the rods for the bags of the catfish<br/>
I don’t believe that god is a black man<br/>
Spoiled child getting robbed for his black vans<br/>
Mars and other stars in the CAT scans<br/>
Back when I listened to Killer Priest<br/>
Had my mind thicker and bigger than Philip Heaps<br/>
Walking around in kufis with sunnis with thicker beads<br/>
Remembering the movies my duty was killing beats<br/>
Social villain unwilling to live in peace<br/>
I told you children I’m willing to live in beast<br/>
Streets, this is where Helen and Ellen meet<br/>
So you can get lost like Gilligan on the beach<br/>
The players getting mad they not kicking it with the freaks<br/>
Cause they took away they pussy and given it to the geeks<br/>
Like us, paradigm shifter, South Carolina Nine shrine shine giver<br/>
But not enough dimes to be a crime line tipper<br/>
The difference between "nigga", and "nigger"<br/>
Uh, Bernie Sanders need a Nike deal<br/>
Then I might consider that, he might be real<br/>
If Phil Knight, knight him then I might like him<br/>
Until then children, enjoy the white icing on the cake<br/>
Cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
On the cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
On the cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
On the cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
Yeah, yeah, pharaoh, height, yeah<br/>
<br/>
What you need a little more? Okay, I’ll give you a little more, I’ll give you a little more a little more<br/>
Freestyle off the top, sitting on the stool on the block<br/>
Watching for the cops watching for the thots and watching for the shots<br/>
I’m watching for a lot, I gotta use my eyes cause they use me<br/>
Cause to them I’m like a price, so I say surprises<br/>
And they don’t deprive us, I just demises<br/>
And nothing ever lies yes, on my premisises<br/>
Watched for my demises<br/>
Maybe might like them, until then just enjoy the white icing on the cake<br/>
Cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
The cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
The cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
The cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
Ameri- the cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
The cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
Ameri- the cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
The cake, cake, cake, cake<br/>
Ameri- the cake, cake, cake, cake
