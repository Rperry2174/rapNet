Diamonds are forever<br/>
They won't leave in the night<br/>
I've no fear that they might<br/>
Desert me<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, F and F, up<br/>
Diamonds are forever<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, ya know what I'm saying<br/>
I figure, I feel like I'm should just, ya no<br/>
Show people the other side that wonder<br/>
Where, ya know wat I'm sayin'<br/>
That are presently unaware<br/>
<br/>
They don't know about it, ya no wat I'm sayin'<br/>
Ya know jus' show 'em there's another side<br/>
To this thing right here we call bling<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to break down the game<br/>
Behind the bracelets, earrings<br/>
Chains, watches and rings, the bling<br/>
The crystal encrusted, princess flooded<br/>
Canary studded, blue colored and blood stained<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the older brother of the drug game<br/>
That giver of fame, the take awayer of lame<br/>
The empowerer of the kings that came to claims and disease<br/>
Believe what the native people were saying<br/>
<br/>
Believe my engagement ring received and flossed<br/>
At the cost of a bondage child minus pain<br/>
Long ago kings use to wear 'em in their armor<br/>
When they fought other armies because it use to scare 'em<br/>
If you wasn't rich couldn't wear em<br/>
<br/>
Witches use to marry and they'd shoot you before they share 'em<br/>
The gift and the curse, the venom and the serum<br/>
Most hated ladies best friend get marked for a clip<br/>
<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', I ain't comin' down on nobody<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', I ain't tryin' to judge nobody<br/>
Or nutin' like that<br/>
You know wat I'm sayin', I've lost to<br/>
<br/>
I might go and get me a pinky ring tommorow<br/>
You know wat I'm sayin' but I just want you to see man<br/>
You know wat I'm sayin', jus' see, man<br/>
<br/>
Sissero so old and genocide<br/>
Until the countryside just to get his shine on<br/>
I fear what the beards and his peers use to do<br/>
Before the world really knew just to get they mind on<br/>
<br/>
Making paper from slave labor and hittin' little kids<br/>
With life time bids making 'em cut and shine stones<br/>
Inflating the price and making 'em look nice<br/>
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on<br/>
<br/>
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone<br/>
Or other conflict countries that people call home<br/>
I figured I would never go to Angola<br/>
So it never did affect me that made me<br/>
Though maybe indirectly<br/>
<br/>
That my necklace was funding a rebellion or a military coo<br/>
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules<br/>
I was brushing of the haters, trying to be cool<br/>
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers<br/>
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools<br/>
<br/>
Shooters of the innocent, torturers of the witnesses<br/>
Burners of the businesses<br/>
At my birth there was the few<br/>
Uhh, I ain't pushing an agenda, homie<br/>
I'm jus' pushing the facts, fuck Bush<br/>
<br/>
'Cause there's people doin' worse on this earth and there black<br/>
I took it for years now let me bring it back<br/>
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars<br/>
But asks yourself do they finance yours<br/>
<br/>
When I first got mine I took 'em out on tour<br/>
They only lost half the value when I took 'em out the store<br/>
Or it was full of moistened Nikes and cubics<br/>
But the jeweler knew I was stupid and that I couldn't prove it<br/>
<br/>
Feeling like I need it because I do music<br/>
To impress the groupies and the interviewers<br/>
So I didn't appraise it nor did I loop it<br/>
Even gave 'em to my girl thinkin' I was cupid<br/>
<br/>
Homies were all hating, hoping they could make me lose it<br/>
Creeping through my own hood, knew I had to remove it<br/>
I see the Russian Mafia, the Jewish Mobsters<br/>
The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers<br/>
Homie, it's a rap for the nonsense rhyming<br/>
Props to Kenya I call it conflict diamonds<br/>
<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', I ain't comin' down on nobody<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', I ain't tryin' to judge nobody<br/>
Or nutin' like that<br/>
You know wat I'm sayin', I've lost to<br/>
<br/>
I might go and get me a pinky ring tommorow<br/>
You know wat I'm sayin' but I just want you to see man<br/>
You know wat I'm sayin', jus' see, man
