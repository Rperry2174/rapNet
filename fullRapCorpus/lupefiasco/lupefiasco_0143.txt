<i>[Simon Sayz:]</i><br/>
See this shit go 'round and 'round<br/>
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright<br/>
All I ever wanted was the dove view<br/>
And all the people that I love to stay high, high, elevated<br/>
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top<br/>
More than high, high, elevated<br/>
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top<br/>
High, more than high, high...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
It drops without, then without doubt I'm without drought<br/>
How else could I spit out 'bout<br/>
Spotted backs without alps<br/>
Rain delay<br/>
What's that I came to say?<br/>
Get it wet like Training Day<br/>
With no drain away, you with it yet<br/>
They ain't related<br/>
Lupe got him an H and K and handle that<br/>
Heckler, Kramer way<br/>
Rain delay<br/>
Aight, nigga, put the game away<br/>
You mean like rain delay?<br/>
She said, "If I pop it then you gotta pay me"<br/>
So I make it rain for the ladies<br/>
Off that, skin' where my shooters can't walk at<br/>
Of course, we ball with hoes<br/>
In the club, I golf that<br/>
But ball back, games where it rains and they halt that<br/>
We gettin' cold, better salt that<br/>
In my brain, it is stormin'<br/>
When it rains, it is pourin'<br/>
Spit out 'bout, swat at bats<br/>
Commissioner Gordon, not a sportsman<br/>
Your reigns, not important<br/>
But I'm Jordan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Simon Sayz:]</i><br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
See this shit go 'round and 'round<br/>
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright<br/>
All I ever wanted was the dove view<br/>
And all the people that I love to stay high, high, elevated<br/>
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top<br/>
More than high, high, elevated<br/>
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top<br/>
High, more than high, high...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco &amp; Simon Sayz:]</i><br/>
Why I always gotta say it for you?<br/>
Why you be as quiet as a DP with an oral<br/>
Why on TV it's adorable?<br/>
In 3D it be horrible<br/>
Somethin' somethin' stored you<br/>
It's like sayin', look, Duval too tall<br/>
Or the cue ball is too small<br/>
I make two fall in the pool hall<br/>
And my new car I carpool<br/>
You all finna carnival<br/>
Through balls, think about to fall<br/>
Get a new doll to my boo, aw<br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
Sweet<br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
Sweet<br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
Sweet<br/>
High, more than high, high<br/>
Sweet<br/>
Enough room for you niggas to eat, deep<br/>
That's a keeper homie, whole lot of square foot to sweep<br/>
I clean, trampoline, flow lift you off of your feet<br/>
Tell your king pass the throne or I'll kick you off of your seat<br/>
Like a drummer, I'll kick you off from your seat<br/>
Like a drum kit, kick you off with my feat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Simon Sayz:]</i><br/>
High, more than high, high...
