<i>[Hook: Bilal]</i><br/>
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas<br/>
You feel radiant and outrageous<br/>
Your confidence and appeal, so sexual<br/>
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?<br/>
How dare you come do me like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I got my eyes on like the fire zone<br/>
Let's be bygones<br/>
Won't you come and be a line in one of my songs?<br/>
Maybe a whole verse, baby the whole Earth my home<br/>
So let me show you around the crib<br/>
Tell you what I do, I show you what I did<br/>
Flow is on the stove, I'm cooking for the kids<br/>
Wrist is in the freezer, heart is in the fridge<br/>
But we can warm it up, plug the Foreman up<br/>
Open the oven door, turn the saunas up<br/>
Stretch the Benz out, if it ain't long enough<br/>
Get lost in the feeling, they're no longer us<br/>
Hop up out the coupe, hop up on the bus<br/>
Give you 'get to the backs', code name for Rosa's sons<br/>
We're in a better place, give us condolences<br/>
It's like a player's wake, and like a coma love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Bilal]</i><br/>
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas<br/>
You feel, you feel radiant and outrageous<br/>
Your confidence and appeal, so sexual<br/>
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?<br/>
How dare you come do me like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And I hope it's all up to your standards<br/>
Cause babies really need to be pampered<br/>
I'm behind these tents like a camper<br/>
Cause you're out there shining like chandler<br/>
Like a chandelier standing there in your radiance<br/>
I think we all need some shadiness<br/>
Or some vision care, oh no, you didn't dare<br/>
While I was sitting here like Huey in his wicker chair<br/>
You know that isn't fair, how you just entered here<br/>
Getting their hopes up, that they can interfere<br/>
You're so insincere, you know I got you<br/>
Have you looked in the mirror? You know that's not cool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Bilal]</i><br/>
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas<br/>
You feel, you feel radiant and outrageous<br/>
Your confidence and appeal, so sexual<br/>
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?<br/>
How dare you come do me like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Let's have a cease fire, be some peace triers<br/>
Let's negotiate, because my cheeks tired<br/>
From smiling all day<br/>
Emotions need a Motrin, a Tylenol break<br/>
I know you see my strategy, if flattery's a battery<br/>
Then I'm a rabbit with a pack of 'D's in the back of me<br/>
Pause/paws on all levels, everybody settle<br/>
I know it sounded weird, I'm just trying to impress you<br/>
I step forward with my best two<br/>
If all that fails, open swag to the rescue<br/>
I said swag, and I'm sorry<br/>
Don't mean to offend your sensibilities I meant dress smartly<br/>
Just trying to get you out this party<br/>
Can you dig that? Ologist-Archae<br/>
Please be the Ferrari to my car key<br/>
And I'ma hold my baby down like a car seat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Bilal]</i><br/>
You know what you're doing to me<br/>
You got that fire fire, baby<br/>
I just can't get enough<br/>
No, I can't get enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Bilal]</i><br/>
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas<br/>
You feel radiant and outrageous<br/>
Your confidence and appeal, you're so sexual<br/>
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?<br/>
How dare you come do me like that
