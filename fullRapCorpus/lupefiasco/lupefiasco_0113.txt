<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
May the Lord have mercy on my soul<br/>
Forgive me for my fetishes, my purchases, my clothes<br/>
Allow me to catch my rhythm so the nervousness just goes<br/>
That's why I sound so certain in my verses and my flows<br/>
The verbiage just gets merciless, the wordsmithness just rolls<br/>
I've tuned into my pertinence, my purposes, my goals<br/>
The feeling when you realize you've been working for your foes<br/>
And the curtains have just opened and they worthlessness exposed<br/>
You remember where you've came from, where the purses was stole<br/>
There was nothing in the oven and just work up on the stove<br/>
And you blossomed from the bottom, yeah, you worked with it and rose<br/>
From nothing to a dozen and a garden now there grows<br/>
Tell 'em!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Pooh Bear]</i><br/>
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart (That's me)<br/>
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart<br/>
(Yessir) Brave heart<br/>
(Yeah I got that) Brave heart<br/>
(You know) Brave heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
May the Lord have mercy on my soul<br/>
Like shows keep cushion where I land<br/>
Keep the devil off my heels<br/>
But please keep me on my toes<br/>
Like a reposessor checking for everything I drove<br/>
Like I owe, but I don't<br/>
Paid my dues from the go<br/>
Doing donuts in the dome, keep my shoes on the floor<br/>
Revered by the rich, plus approved by the poor<br/>
I been sped up where they sniff it<br/>
And screwed up where they pour<br/>
See I flew so way up high<br/>
And I SCUBA'd way down low<br/>
Put the top down on my fears<br/>
Put the roof up on my woes<br/>
I dropped that food and liquor to put you up on my stove<br/>
They shoplifted and stole<br/>
That just let me know they know<br/>
That was Lupe #1, now this version #4<br/>
And I still feel like a virgin me versus the globe<br/>
From the surface to the cove<br/>
I took on the biggest wave<br/>
And I surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro<br/>
Took the wood from the slave ships and furnished my abode<br/>
Now that boat is now my bed, desk, dressers and my drawers<br/>
Now that's a house of pain!<br/>
Plus I use nooses when I hang up all my clothes<br/>
Couldn't change up if I chose<br/>
That's me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Pooh Bear]</i><br/>
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart<br/>
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart<br/>
(Yessir) Brave heart<br/>
(Yeah I got that) Brave heart<br/>
(You know) Brave heart<br/>
<br/>
Brave heart...<br/>
<br/>
(Yessir) Brave heart<br/>
(Yeah I got that) Brave heart<br/>
(You know) Brave heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
May the Lord have...<br/>
Mercy on my soul
