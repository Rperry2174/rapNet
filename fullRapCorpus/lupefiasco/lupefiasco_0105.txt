<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
First off say peace to Pine Ridge<br/>
Shame on all the damage the white man wine did<br/>
Ghost dance, Trail of Tears, 5 million beers a year<br/>
And all that other crime did<br/>
More peace to the teachers of blind kids<br/>
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big<br/>
Say everything’s hostile<br/>
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models<br/>
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to<br/>
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you<br/>
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag<br/>
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab<br/>
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags<br/>
A peace sign and a pants sag<br/>
A money toss cause a 9 stripper mad dash<br/>
A friend request following a hash tag<br/>
Now everybody want it like the last laugh<br/>
A Michael Jackson jacket or a daft mask<br/>
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class<br/>
Stable is when the Ba’ath had Baghdad<br/>
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad<br/>
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat<br/>
Cause that’s just more dinosaur for the Cadillac<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Live from the other side what you see<br/>
A bunch of nonsense on my TV<br/>
Heaven on Earth is what I need<br/>
But I feel I’m in hell every time I breathe<br/>
Reporting live from the other side what you hear<br/>
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear<br/>
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay<br/>
Cause freedom ain’t free, especially ’round my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And we marvel at the state of heart of man<br/>
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can<br/>
America’s a big motherfuckin’ garbageman<br/>
If you ain’t know, you’re part and parcel of the problem<br/>
You say no you ain’t, and I say yes you is<br/>
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is<br/>
You say no they didn’t, and I say yes they did<br/>
The definition of unnecessary-ness<br/>
Manifested<br/>
Say that we should protest just to get arrested<br/>
That goes against all my hustling ethics<br/>
A bunch of jail niggas say its highly ineffective<br/>
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip<br/>
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate<br/>
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit<br/>
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with<br/>
It’s all one song short of a set list<br/>
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast<br/>
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish<br/>
So absurd word to Chief Bone Necklace<br/>
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino<br/>
A whole culture boiled down to giving you paquino<br/>
I go as left as a heart in the chest<br/>
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
An all white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler<br/>
Hope and pray they take Columbus day up off the calendar<br/>
South Central an example of God’s gifts<br/>
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in spa 6<br/>
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns<br/>
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound<br/>
It’s parts of Manilla like the video for Thriller<br/>
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa<br/>
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla<br/>
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia<br/>
Cash rules everything around these niggas<br/>
As classrooms everywhere around me wither<br/>
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers<br/>
The tyrant or the slave but nowhere in the middle<br/>
Of the extremes of America’s dream<br/>
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, naaa…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
