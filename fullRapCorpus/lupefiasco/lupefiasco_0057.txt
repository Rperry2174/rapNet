<i>[Chorus: Matthew]</i><br/>
Death is on the tip of her tongue and dangers at the tip of her fingers<br/>
Streets<br/>
Are<br/>
On<br/>
Fire<br/>
To-<br/>
Night<br/>
<br/>
Death is on the tip of her tongue and dangers at the tip of her fingers<br/>
Streets<br/>
Are<br/>
On<br/>
Fire<br/>
To-<br/>
Night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe]</i><br/>
Disease the virus is spreading in all directions<br/>
No safe zone no cure and no protection<br/>
No symptoms to find the signs of an infection<br/>
No vaccines remedies and no corrections<br/>
Quarantines the dreams and cut off our connections<br/>
Don't let em in not a friend not a reflection<br/>
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and<br/>
Don't accept em if you wanna stay as an exception<br/>
No pill<br/>
Can heal<br/>
The ill of this<br/>
Sickness some are still in doubt of it's existence<br/>
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance<br/>
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance<br/>
The poor say the rich have the cure<br/>
The rich say the poor are the source<br/>
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war<br/>
Invented by the press<br/>
Just to have something to report<br/>
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward<br/>
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floor<br/>
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores<br/>
And everybody is sure<br/>
<br/>
The scientists said it only infects the mind<br/>
The little boy said it only infects the girls<br/>
The Preacher man said it's gonna kill off the soul<br/>
A bum said it's gonna kill the whole wide world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Matthew]</i><br/>
Death is on the tip of her tongue and dangers at the tip of her fingers<br/>
Streets<br/>
Are<br/>
On<br/>
Fire<br/>
To-<br/>
Night<br/>
<br/>
Death is on the tip of her tongue and dangers at the tip of her fingers<br/>
Streets<br/>
Are<br/>
On<br/>
Fire<br/>
To-<br/>
Night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe]</i><br/>
Believe some say the neon signs<br/>
Might allow speakers repeating<br/>
And everything is fine<br/>
A subtle silence<br/>
To demolish the troubled conscious<br/>
Of a compass with no knowledge<br/>
And every freedom denied<br/>
Every dream is designed and broadcasted<br/>
From the masters to the masses<br/>
From the antennas on top of the shrines<br/>
As far as the receiving planet during a panic is shorted<br/>
It reports back everything in your mind<br/>
Everything is lying<br/>
Everything is dying<br/>
Everything is a rule<br/>
And everything is a crime<br/>
Everything was healed<br/>
And everything rewinds<br/>
And new weather burn a feathers off everything's line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Matthew]</i><br/>
And she likes it<br/>
And she loves it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe]</i><br/>
The sadness<br/>
The madness<br/>
The bad shit<br/>
The lavish<br/>
The fastness<br/>
To clashes the ashes<br/>
To ashes everything intertwined<br/>
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel<br/>
Once caught her changing her batteries in her halo<br/>
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for<br/>
And the address to the factory where they made those<br/>
<br/>
The scientist says she all inside mind<br/>
The little boy said "What happened to all the girls?"<br/>
The preacher man says she gonna kill off the souls<br/>
The dope boy said it's the whole wide world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Matthew]</i><br/>
Death is on the tip of her tongue and dangers at the tip of her fingers<br/>
Streets<br/>
Are<br/>
On<br/>
Fire<br/>
To-<br/>
Night<br/>
<br/>
Death is on the tip of her tongue and dangers at the tip of her fingers<br/>
Streets<br/>
Are<br/>
On<br/>
Fire<br/>
To-<br/>
Night
