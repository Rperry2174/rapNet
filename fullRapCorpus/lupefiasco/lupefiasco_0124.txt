Now bring it out<br/>
Like a finger in the back of your mouth<br/>
Cherubs and cerebellum, Tara at Sarah's wedding<br/>
Sam marrying Sam<br/>
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand<br/>
If that sickens you, you a bigot<br/>
If it doesn't well you're wicked<br/>
Such is life<br/>
Odd as Egg McMuffins at night<br/>
No answers, so let us watch these dancers<br/>
Structure reformed gracefully being born<br/>
On the pallet of dark greys, concaves and spirals<br/>
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel<br/>
It ripples then it tidals<br/>
Vacillates then it virals<br/>
Babylons then it Bibles and others<br/>
And tell me of the spinning mothers<br/>
And today's mathematics for beloved<br/>
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nikki Jean:]</i><br/>
How was your day, can I make what you say<br/>
What I wanna hear, cause I want you here<br/>
The hell that we raised to the heavens do anything for<br/>
La petite mort, la petite mort<br/>
<br/>
They keep the bottles just to make glass houses<br/>
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it<br/>
Then expect not a volley in reply<br/>
Some place vulnerable like prolly in the eye<br/>
What of the chicken? what is it missin', is it dry?<br/>
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed<br/>
And attention from its demise pulled all of the flavour from the fat<br/>
And made it flat and rather lifeless<br/>
Well there's a place that has a stunning <i>[?]</i><br/>
And more mercifully murdered Pisces<br/>
But barbaric are still the prices<br/>
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices<br/>
My son will call risotto rices<br/>
If and when he's left to his own devices, well<br/>
How is your memory?<br/>
Is it returning like a lemon tree<br/>
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me<br/>
Or was it slippin' like permission am I trippin' like Phil<br/>
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transition<br/>
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief<br/>
Will cheese never touch your teeth<br/>
Maybe like kosher beef<br/>
Is it real, is it real, is it real<br/>
Ha, hah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nikki Jean:]</i><br/>
How at the date can I make you my break<br/>
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear<br/>
The hell that we raised to the heavens make <i>[?]</i> for<br/>
Our petite mort, our petite mort<br/>
<br/>
So glad you're back, but not glad at that you're <i>[?]</i><br/>
Where is the glamour in collapse?<br/>
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds<br/>
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon<br/>
The attended years slowly fills with baboons<br/>
That other monkey business<br/>
Where killers go free cause a junkie's a funky witness<br/>
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death<br/>
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks<br/>
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums<br/>
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum<br/>
Where recognition went unnoticed<br/>
And then solidified till it was stoic<br/>
We should've been poets<br/>
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nikki Jean:]</i><br/>
How are your chains, do they make you behave<br/>
Keep you over here, by your overseer<br/>
Fallen from grace down from heaven to memories <i>[?]</i><br/>
La petite mort, la petite mort
