<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You must be, a radio station<br/>
And who are we, we must be<br/>
A number one song, spinning all day long<br/>
And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again<br/>
And we know when,<br/>
When we call in,<br/>
And nothing's free,<br/>
Sounds to me like,<br/>
State run radio <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
We interrupt this broadcast,<br/>
To bring you a special message about the forecast,<br/>
The future's cloudy and it's raining on the poor class,<br/>
The roads to peace are closed, and the traffic's on the war paths,<br/>
Love is balling on a budget, the military's stressing<br/>
We need more cash, to keep fighting for your gas<br/>
Keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore pass,<br/>
Stay inside of your half, believe the lies you learn in your class,<br/>
That there's no treasure in your trash, &amp; the ceiling has the same feeling,<br/>
That the floor has, and that's where you should stay,<br/>
This is what they play<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again<br/>
And we know when,<br/>
When we call in,<br/>
And nothing's free,<br/>
Sounds to me like,<br/>
State run radio <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You're now tuned into the weakest,<br/>
Frequency of fear, keep you locked right here,<br/>
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader,<br/>
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures,<br/>
Never ever believe that, you will never need this,<br/>
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this,<br/>
Hi, you're on the air, now what you want to hear?<br/>
Well we ain't got the truth, but how about a remix?<br/>
Different is never good, good is only what we pick,<br/>
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did,<br/>
Not too smart you will be a superstar,<br/>
And if you dumb or something maybe you could be number one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You must be, a radio station,<br/>
And who are we, we must be,<br/>
A number one song, spinning all day long,<br/>
And you put me, in daily rotation,<br/>
You're on the air,<br/>
We know you're scared,<br/>
But we don't care,<br/>
We'll play this here,<br/>
And over again, and over again, and over again, and over again, and over again<br/>
And you know when,<br/>
When we call in,<br/>
And nothing's free,<br/>
Sounds to me like,<br/>
State run radio <i>[x16]</i>
