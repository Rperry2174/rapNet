A simplified love sick,<br/>
Taking no prisoners,<br/>
Sunny day, cold heart,<br/>
Listen up listeners,<br/>
Darkside love affair,<br/>
Out of time, and in a rush,<br/>
You can't help me 'til the sunrise lifts up.<br/>
<br/>
Let's levitate up the horizon,<br/>
I can see it in your eyes,<br/>
Everythin' you're hidin'<br/>
I can see the truth in you,<br/>
Even when you're lyin'<br/>
Even through the darkness,<br/>
I can see you shinin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Well it's midnight, and it's colder,<br/>
Pull you closer, I can see you through.<br/>
When it's sunshine, and it's solar,<br/>
And it's over, guess it's me and you.<br/>
Blood. (Blood) By. (By) Sun. (Sun) Light. (Light)<br/>
<br/>
A played out love song,<br/>
Playin' in the background<br/>
Seems to describe every part of where we're at now.<br/>
Every feeling we ever had for each other,<br/>
Ever karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered.<br/>
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble,<br/>
Now it's couple trouble makers,<br/>
Making mayhem on the double,<br/>
Tryna figure out the meanin' and break apart the puzzles,<br/>
Why they love you, when I hate you,<br/>
When they hate the way I love you.<br/>
(Solar.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Well it's midnight, and it's colder,<br/>
Pull you closer, I can see you through.<br/>
When it's sunshine, and it's solar,<br/>
And it's over, guess it's me and you.<br/>
<br/>
Well it's midnight, and it's colder,<br/>
Pull you closer, I can see you through.<br/>
When it's sunshine, and it's solar,<br/>
And it's over, guess it's me and you.<br/>
Blood. (Blood) By. (By) Sun. (Sun) Light. (Light)<br/>
<br/>
A complicated heartbreak,<br/>
Losing it's direction,<br/>
Cold day, warm heart,<br/>
Object of affection,<br/>
My darkside, love affair,<br/>
Come to my protection,<br/>
Midnight's on the way,<br/>
I'm losing my connection.<br/>
<br/>
Let's levitate over the horizon,<br/>
I can see it in your eyes,<br/>
Everythin' you're hidin'<br/>
I can see the truth in you,<br/>
Even when you're lyin'<br/>
Even through the darkness,<br/>
I wanna see you shinin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Well it's midnight, and it's colder,<br/>
Pull you closer, I can see you through.<br/>
When it's sunshine, and it's solar,<br/>
And it's over, guess it's me and you.<br/>
<br/>
Well it's midnight, and it's colder,<br/>
Pull you closer, I can see you through.<br/>
When it's sunshine, and it's solar,<br/>
And it's over, guess it's me and you.<br/>
<br/>
Well it's midnight, and it's colder,<br/>
Pull you closer, I can see you through.<br/>
When it's sunshine, and it's solar,<br/>
And it's over, guess it's me and you.<br/>
<br/>
Well it's midnight, and it's colder,<br/>
Pull you closer, I can see you through.<br/>
When it's sunshine, and it's solar,<br/>
And it's over, guess it's me and you.
