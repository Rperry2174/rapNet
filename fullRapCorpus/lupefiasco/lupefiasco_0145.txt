Saturday night for niggas<br/>
Astronauts and alcohol<br/>

Runnin' 'round and 'round she go<br/>
We got dollar bills to kill<br/>

Get your money out niggas<br/>
Money to burn in the atmosphere<br/>
I'ma turn it up, you burn it up<br/>
Turn it up, you burn it up<br/>

You gettin' more than that just off me, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>

If I keep on drinkin', I'ma lose it all<br/>

<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
My nigga, if these poles could talk<br/>
If the stage grew another pole, got up and walked<br/>
Gotta kill these dollars, it can't be an assault<br/>
Need your real love, mama, you can't be in my thoughts<br/>
Oh, no<br/>
I knew a ten down in Houston<br/>
So I wonder if you can do it slow-mo<br/>
Then speed it up, heat it up, drop it down, beat it up<br/>
Take it off, make it talk, shake it all, make it fall<br/>
ATM, ATM, mama love to take it all<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Victoria Monet:]</i><br/>
Just another Saturday night<br/>
Showtime, I deserve these lights<br/>
'Cause I work hard for what I get<br/>
Just so I can give my ten percent<br/>
You better pay up, pay up or get out<br/>
I'm not into how you get down<br/>
Hope you love me in the moment<br/>
But I know where I'm goin'<br/>
And I'm just tryna get through this...<br/>

<i>[Victoria Monet, Ty Dolla $ign &amp; Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Man girl I made a killin' off these drunk ass niggas tonight<br/>
Ayy bruh that shit was goin' up, man<br/>
But damn they had my pole clean today, I'm sick of this shit<br/>
This bitch spilled her mothafuckin' drink on my goddamn shoes<br/>
You dirtier than a mothafucka, dawg<br/>
Next time they better have my shit clean<br/>
'Cause I can't go up in this strip club<br/>
Ayy it's cool though<br/>
You already know<br/>
I'll get some new ones tomorrow, fuck it<br/>
You know the other spot poppin'?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
No more doin' that shit and tryna go to church in the morning<br/>
Let's go to the other spot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco &amp; Victoria Monet:]</i><br/>
Now it's Sunday mornin' for sinners<br/>
Preacher's daughter, holy water<br/>
Be reborn, beginner<br/>
'Round and 'round we know<br/>
It's like dollar bills to save<br/>
Make it rain on that collection plate<br/>
Need a dollar bill to save<br/>
Make it rain on that collection plate<br/>
And your dollar bills can save<br/>
Make it rain on that collection plate<br/>
You made it clap, now take it back<br/>
Pray<br/>
You made it clap, now take it back<br/>
Pray<br/>
You made it clap, now take it back<br/>
Pray<br/>
You made it clap, now take it back<br/>
Watch it all wash away<br/>
Watch it all wash away<br/>
Watch it all wash away
