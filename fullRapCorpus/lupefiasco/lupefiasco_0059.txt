<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I swear when I see this nigga, I'ma kill em, I'm going to kill him, so make niggas suffer.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy streets be all<br/>
Like feed me feed me when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy (x2)<br/>
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey he had a whole lot of cheese plus he was a mac had a whole lot of steez<br/>
Made a lot of niggas fat gave a whole lot of G's, grams man he had a whole lot of these<br/>
And he would let you hold a whole lot of keys, even if u lose some he would give you new ones<br/>
Twice the bread like he had two buns, and he had a whole lot of steez even his kids had meals<br/>
For reals some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was little, ketchup nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My man said life ain't easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy streets be all<br/>
Like feed me feed me when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy<br/>
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
He was a heart breaker and a large shaker, if it was bout caking, he was a part taker<br/>
International he would take trips bon voyage just as hard he was fishing for the chips so greedy<br/>
Never gave to the needy thats what some say he shoned on the bums hanging in the subways he<br/>
Called them fruits and laughed at em delivery man on the pick up drive through and throw the bag<br/>
At em it was hard to understand him sometimes making a killing the way he had em standing in line<br/>
Like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy streets be all<br/>
Like feed me feed me when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy<br/>
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Lovers call him king haters call him clown he would say bite me thats the way its goin down he<br/>
Was having thoughts that maybe he should retire went to church on sunday and saw a deep fryer said<br/>
He had beef and people want him dead he love the hungry ones only scared of the feds he lived<br/>
The fast life couldn't get his path right fried just told him bout the hooters that he had last<br/>
Night turn yourself in to the patty wagon said no bacon wouldn't take em had the pigs on the pay<br/>
Roll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
To be continued, on another menu, ya dig.<br/>
Will he give up his life of crime or will he stay?<br/>
This and other adventured on lupe fiasco's next album, L - U - P - END<br/>
<br/>
Yessir!<br/>
<br/>
My man said life ain't easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy, hey!
