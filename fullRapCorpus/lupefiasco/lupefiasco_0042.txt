Now I ain't tryna be the greatest<br/>
I used to hate hip-hop... yup, because the women degraded<br/>
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it<br/>
A hypocrite I stated, though I only recited half<br/>
Omittin the word "bitch," cursin I wouldn't say it<br/>
Me and dog couldn't relate, til a bitch I dated<br/>
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike<br/>
But I learnt it from a song I heard and sorta liked<br/>
Yeah, for the icin, glamorized drug dealin was appealin<br/>
But the block club kept it from in front of our buildin<br/>
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the buildin blocks<br/>
For children with leakin ceilings catchin drippins with pots<br/>
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's "It Was Written"<br/>
In the mix with my realities and feelings<br/>
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision <br/>
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop<br/>
<br/>
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me<br/>
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me<br/>
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me<br/>
And I got noooo place to gooo<br/>
They bomb my village, they call us killers<br/>
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care<br/>
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me<br/>
And it huuurts meee soooul<br/>
<br/>
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott<br/>
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti<br/>
I'm thinkin godly, God guard me from the ungodly<br/>
But by my 30th watchin of "Streets is Watchin"<br/>
I was back to givin props again and that was botherin <br/>
By this uncomfortable as a untouchable touchin you<br/>
The theme songs that niggas hustle to seem wrong but these songs was comin true<br/>
And it was all becoming cool <br/>
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into and thought<br/>
What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit then they drop it<br/>
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it<br/>
It seems I was seein the same scene adopted<br/>
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it<br/>
They said don't knock it, mind ya business<br/>
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimpin got it<br/>
<br/>
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water<br/>
I can't get hired, they cross on fire<br/>
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced<br/>
So I got noooo place to gooo<br/>
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time<br/>
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader<br/>
My father ain't seen me, turn off my TV<br/>
'Cause it huuurts meee soooul<br/>
<br/>
So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening<br/>
Macintosh marketing<br/>
Oil field augering<br/>
Brazilian adolescent disarmament<br/>
Israeli occupation<br/>
Islamic martyrdom, precise<br/>
Yeah, laser guided targeting<br/>
Oil for food, water, and terrorist organization harborin<br/>
Sand camouflage army men<br/>
CCF sponsorin, world conquerin, telephone monitorin<br/>
Louis Vuitton modelin, pornographic actress honorin <br/>
String theory ponderin, bullimic vomitin<br/>
Catholic priest fondlin, pre-emptive bombin and Osama and no bombin them<br/>
They breakin in my car again, deforestation and overloggin and <br/>
Hennessy and Hypnotic swallowin, hydroponic coughin and<br/>
All the world's ills, sittin on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that<br/>
<br/>
They say I'm infected, this is why I injected<br/>
I had it aborted, we got deported<br/>
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here<br/>
But I got noooo place to gooo<br/>
I can't stop eatin, my best friend's leavin<br/>
My pastor touched me, I love this country<br/>
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me<br/>
'Cause it huuurts meee soooul
