<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Quiet as a kitten<br/>
Reply as silent as a Raphael-given instrument for stickin'<br/>
Or maybe riot as a lion<br/>
Would he tie in tiger for attention?<br/>
Tiggers and Poohs, niggas and jews<br/>
Mr. Opulent Christopher Robinson too<br/>
Reversal like<br/>
When that predetermined term expires on a turtle's life<br/>
What of Korea, are you scared?<br/>
Or is something not there, like a Welsh rabbit full of hairs<br/>
Animal farms and imaginary bears<br/>
The body is a house like a kangaroo pouch<br/>
Or an oyster-hoisted cow over crescent moons as it looms low in the night sky<br/>
Platoons of coons stand ready for the drive-by<br/>
Steady as the medley booms from the Akai<br/>
Affirm as in "Aye aye"<br/>
Like it the second<br/>
Like a junior, like a third, like a eye<br/>
Like a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high<br/>
Sitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy<br/>
Who let these G's out the PI_STY?<br/>
Seems they taking cues from The Wire<br/>
Okay decorum, and keeping you from wanting to buy it<br/>
But you still buy it like you never left it's sight<br/>
And like a slow gunfighter gun: unfired<br/>
Cow dung walls, hermit crabs in the mall, sting ray from the stars and barnyard laws<br/>
These are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: Atoms for Peace sample]</i><br/>
Hey hey, just cause I got thumbs, that don't mean everybody is dumb, huh huh?<br/>
Just cause I got one, that don't mean that they got none, what what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Quiet as a mouse in the House of God<br/>
In the jaws, like tyrants in the mouths of mobs<br/>
Ripping it to pieces like a picture and a preacher<br/>
If a cricket was a speaker, it's it's own chicken bones on the garbage can top<br/>
Ugly mother freakers is predator opposite on top of it to make it fox<br/>
So if similar appeal, administer the seal to make it real<br/>
Elephantine but never mind<br/>
Half-ton gorillas in admittance, they'll never find<br/>
Hungry as a hippopotamus, gobble it 'til your bottom and your body is as wobbly as Skrillex<br/>
Eeyores and Piglets, blind bats nailing tails to a riblet<br/>
Time only limited (ed) if you make it<br/>
Blind rat's nails hold tales of Unseeing Eye selves<br/>
Out is out, so they only seeing thy shells<br/>
Ghost Dog<br/>
Oh lawd<br/>
These are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Atoms for Peace sample]</i><br/>
Hey they not dumb<br/>
I ain't smart just cause I got thumbs, what, say what?<br/>
Hey hey, just cause I got one<br/>
That don't mean I'm better cause they got none, say what, say what say what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
The butcher says to the bovines<br/>
You're all just pastrami when it's showtime<br/>
Cowboy co-signs, attack the cat samples<br/>
Own worst enemies<br/>
Chop down the trees, we need the axe handles<br/>
Like a heel in a sandal saying "hell no"<br/>
Or you trapped like the yells of a nail in the shell-toe<br/>
Clever as a fishbowl on a sailboat<br/>
Landlocked as a ham hock on a railroad<br/>
Sandbox by the swimming pool<br/>
Two times as clever as a fishing school<br/>
Pills for the pressure<br/>
Broken seals on the pills for the pleasure<br/>
If you feeling ill, whatever<br/>
Animal farm, you're all dumb<br/>
Tickle 'em with your articulated thumb,<br/>
A tapeworm will never play the drums, but um<br/>
These are<br/>
These are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3: Atoms for Peace sample]</i><br/>
Hey hey, just cause I got one<br/>
That don't mean I'm smart cause they got none<br/>
W-what, w-what<br/>
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs?<br/>
That don't make me smart cause they got none, say what?<br/>
W-what, w-what<br/>
Here we come<br/>
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs, say what?<br/>
Say what, say what?
