Look look! Gander gander!<br/>
Its the young boy from the land of Lambda!<br/>
The Land of Lincoln , the Grand Theft Auto Chicago warn all the mics that he hardcore.<br/>
And he's thinking Rose buried to the area, spotlights,<br/>
Dancers dancers!<br/>
Pros who come in, answer answer,<br/>
His flow is like the Klu Klux versus the Panthers<br/>
Hahaaaaaaaa!<br/>
Hit the track like a heart attack<br/>
Cancer cancer, boogie man on the mic, and the band of Santas, and the easter bunny is the back up dancer.<br/>
They faintin in the stands gotta fan the fans uh.<br/>
Panties on the stage and the pampers are grandmas, cuz they love the way that I pamper the grammar.<br/>
Moonmen struttin down the ramp of the land-a.<br/>
Hes nuts with a cane Planters Planters!<br/>
Adjust my frames, tamper tamper!<br/>
I'm real, like Seinfeld, they ain't talking about nothin, George Canstanza. Louder louder, grander grander.<br/>
Cuff a friend, read it to em like Miranda.<br/>
The games endangered, Pandas Pandas, send orders to the reporters tell em pan the cameras.<br/>
You might get killed if you don't listen enough, well I guess I'm dead cuz I ain't listen to Puff, hahaaaaaaaaa!<br/>
Best believe our system it sucks, but a person like me don't believe in the system and such, naw I be rippin it up.<br/>
But for every pond there is different ducks.<br/>
I believe if you participate at a lower level you could a lot more done,<br/>
like working wit the alderman, but I ain't alterin this song to be a political statement lets take it back to the basement.<br/>
To the encore, the sold out tours, the more mores, and the standing ovations.<br/>
They be standing with more patience than the county on a Friday I did it my way
