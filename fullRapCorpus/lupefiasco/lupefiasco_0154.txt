Hello Gorgeous<br/>
The phone call’s probably being recorded<br/>
Just know that I did it for the four of us<br/>
And those mutherfuckers kept ignorin’ us<br/>
After this I’m going underground<br/>
If they come asking give them the run-around<br/>
How does Costa Rica in the summer sound?<br/>
Couple days then we moving to another town<br/>
Yea I know them dreams, seems<br/>
Just know that time’ll never come between<br/>
Space either, fake features<br/>
Things that we reject but connects all us believers<br/>
The insurrection’s gone viral<br/>
They’ll never stop it now<br/>
I hope it all spirals<br/>
Outta control, like a dam with a hole<br/>
From here on out it’s all about survival<br/>
The way we left things they probably think we rivals<br/>
But don’t be naive, they hate you more than I do<br/>
Remember always speak in opposites, I hate you so much, it’s such a compliment<br/>
I know that defies the common sense, but we ain’t never been right: honestness<br/>
We never fit in school, and never did rules, but who’d a thought we’d turn out bombing shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I’m giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel<br/>
I want to drive you through the night down the hills<br/>
I’m gonna tell you something don’t want to hear<br/>
I’m gonna show you where it’s dark but have no fear<br/>
<br/>
He said he was just so tired, of them fighting our water with fire<br/>
He said that we need something drier, to really impress the empire<br/>
Funny cause he really hated war, but why we went to war is what he really hated more<br/>
Said it’s silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor<br/>
When he came back from the Corps, is when he really got serious<br/>
Read a lot of books, started acting all mysterious<br/>
The VA is what really made him furious, told him his condition didn’t exist, period<br/>
That’s why he started that petition, went all the way to Washington, said they didn’t listen to a white male Christian<br/>
He just laughed when they took our father’s pension<br/>
He said that you gotta act in opposites, helps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant<br/>
But I knew he felt bad, told me later was the saddest day he ever had<br/>
To see our dad so hopeless, that was the turning point that’s what really gave him focus<br/>
I didn’t agree with everything, some of it made sense<br/>
But never thought that he would do something like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I know you don’t watch but your brother was on TV<br/>
Couple guys in black suits came around to see me<br/>
They went through all your book’s and took all of your CDs<br/>
My granny said you’d be all right, she saw it in the tea leaves<br/>
All the operations going well, had a lotta contact from all the other cells<br/>
Everybody, everywhere is calling you a hero<br/>
They going through the rubble, but the body count is zero<br/>
It’s all violent and bloodless, I know the government really loves this<br/>
This account is hacked, you know how to keep in touch<br/>
I’ll never see you again, I hate you so much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
There’s something inside you<br/>
It’s hard to explain<br/>
They’re talking about you boy<br/>
But you’re still the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
