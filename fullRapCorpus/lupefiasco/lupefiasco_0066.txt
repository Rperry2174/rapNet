I'm feelin' like<br/>
I ain't feelin' right<br/>
I'm feelin' like<br/>
I'm feelin' fly<br/>
Right in the sky<br/>
Unidentified<br/>
Flying object<br/>
That a sinners hide<br/>
You can get a ride<br/>
Just get in line<br/>
Hand by your heart<br/>
Like memorize<br/>
Ask God please<br/>
Could you energize?<br/>
Beam on up<br/>
To the Enterprise<br/>
From the inner-city<br/>
Or the winter-city<br/>
Where's Mini-mini?<br/>
Not Mini-me's<br/>
Only Mini-me's<br/>
Not a lot of hymns<br/>
Only one eye<br/>
Whole lot of them<br/>
Saw a cyclops<br/>
That's a eye clock<br/>
Like a Rolex<br/>
With a eye patch<br/>
See what I got<br/>
Matches on the wall<br/>
Plus a crazy flow<br/>
Suicide watch<br/>
I'm just killin' time<br/>
Plus I'm insane<br/>
In a straight jacket<br/>
But it's Romanelli<br/>
I'm just gettin' back<br/>
For now it's kinda poor<br/>
Want to have things<br/>
Couldn't afford a Pelle<br/>
So don't mind me<br/>
'cause I ain't got a mind<br/>
I don't front hard<br/>
I ain't got a mind<br/>
I'm just gettin' mine<br/>
But don't step here<br/>
Because it's unbear<br/>
That I didn't find<br/>
Nympho mo' top<br/>
Like a Mohawk<br/>
I remember when<br/>
I was so not<br/>
It was no locks<br/>
Man I couldn't ball<br/>
I was so bald<br/>
Robocop<br/>
I was Mr. Clean<br/>
Now I'm Mr. T<br/>
But a different team<br/>
F &amp; F rules<br/>
Call me F.I.<br/>
From the west side<br/>
And I'm underground<br/>
Pepperin' you fool (yeah homey)<br/>
<br/>
Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that<br/>
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back<br/>
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that<br/>
Well you can't see me, that's 'cause everything is black<br/>
(Black <i>[x7]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
And I'm feelin' good<br/>
Like a villain would<br/>
If he was doin' bad<br/>
Kill Superman<br/>
Tied to a log<br/>
Push into a saw<br/>
Take a little dog<br/>
Right through the fan<br/>
Enemy man<br/>
Like a dictionary<br/>
Like a definition<br/>
Like you never listen<br/>
Not the issue is it<br/>
But the deaf part<br/>
Break it in half<br/>
Like an intermission<br/>
You'll see then<br/>
What I mean then<br/>
Or what I meant there<br/>
Doesn't impair<br/>
Now you're learnin' it<br/>
Keep versin' it<br/>
'til it's permanent<br/>
Like pen-pal<br/>
Got an empire<br/>
I'm the emperor<br/>
Like the cat were<br/>
I'll be faster<br/>
Are you tryin' to ask her<br/>
Just slow me down<br/>
But I'm goin' down<br/>
Like a network<br/>
That's wolf-man<br/>
You got a full house<br/>
I got a full moon<br/>
Then I pull out<br/>
The ace-summer sleeve<br/>
Like my hand hurt<br/>
Lend me your chips<br/>
What they took now<br/>
What they put now<br/>
Gotta look down<br/>
And check your shoulder<br/>
'cause I'll be over<br/>
Like a boater<br/>
You got boaters<br/>
In your loafers<br/>
Put your foot down<br/>
While I ottoman<br/>
Or a Laz-E-Boy<br/>
Or a handstand<br/>
See I elevate<br/>
L.A., Otis<br/>
My toes is<br/>
And my flow sick<br/>
Let it marinate<br/>
Try to break it down<br/>
Might take a while<br/>
All good though<br/>
I'll wait around<br/>
While you chase it down<br/>
That white rabbit<br/>
Down that long hole<br/>
Like paper towels (yeah homey)<br/>
<br/>
Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that<br/>
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back<br/>
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that<br/>
Well you can't see me, that's 'cause everything is black<br/>
(Black <i>[x13]</i>, everything is black)<br/>
(Black <i>[x12]</i>, you can't see me)<br/>
<br/>
So this light's out<br/>
Like a lighthouse<br/>
In the daytime<br/>
Make it lay down<br/>
Make it go to bed<br/>
Make it go to sleep<br/>
Like D-bo<br/>
Who needs jumpin' cred<br/>
That's a headlock<br/>
It's what I said I got<br/>
The whole game is<br/>
Like shooter box<br/>
Then the Shokazuki<br/>
If you don't know the movies<br/>
I ninja vanish<br/>
Michael Dudikoff<br/>
I get super low<br/>
I get super lost<br/>
I be super cool<br/>
Like a super boss<br/>
Say they super bad<br/>
But they super soft<br/>
Like super chicken<br/>
Without the super sauce<br/>
Let's step out<br/>
It's a rap now<br/>
Blow your candles<br/>
And your lamps out<br/>
When I pull up<br/>
You can pull the plug<br/>
'cause it's game over<br/>
It's a black out<br/>
<br/>
Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that<br/>
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back<br/>
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that<br/>
Well you can't see me, that's 'cause everything is black<br/>
(Black <i>[x13]</i>, everything is black)<br/>
(Black <i>[x12]</i>, you can't see me)
