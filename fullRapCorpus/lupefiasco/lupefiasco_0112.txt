The wound heals but it never does<br/>
That's 'cause you're at war with love<br/>
You're at war with love, yeah<br/>
<br/>
These battle scars don't look like they're fading<br/>
Don't look like they're ever going away<br/>
They ain't never gonna change<br/>
These battle<br/>
<br/>
Never let a wound ruin me<br/>
But I feel like ruins wooing me<br/>
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree<br/>
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me<br/>
But when you're trying to beat the odds up<br/>
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know<br/>
And let her go but the fear of the unknown<br/>
Holding another lover strong sends you back into the zone<br/>
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home<br/>
A lover not a fighter on the front line with a poem<br/>
Trying to write yourself a rifle<br/>
Maybe sharpen up a song<br/>
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone<br/>
<br/>
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched<br/>
I wish that I could stop loving you so much<br/>
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together<br/>
When all of the signs say that I should forget her<br/>
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had<br/>
I wish that the good outweighed the bad<br/>
'Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
These battle scars don't look like they're fading<br/>
Don't look like they're ever going away<br/>
They ain't never gonna change<br/>
<br/>
These battle<br/>
<br/>
(And just leave then)<br/>
You shouldn't have but you said it<br/>
(And I hope you never come back)<br/>
It shouldn't have happened but you let it<br/>
Now you're down on the ground screaming, "Medic!"<br/>
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses<br/>
Shields, body armors and vests<br/>
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt<br/>
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends<br/>
The best medicine is to probably just let her win<br/>
<br/>
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love<br/>
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much<br/>
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together<br/>
When all of the signs say that I should forget her<br/>
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had<br/>
I wish that the good outweighed the bad<br/>
'Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
These battle scars don't look like they're fading<br/>
Don't look like they're ever going away<br/>
They ain't never gonna change<br/>
<br/>
These battle<br/>
<br/>
'Cause you've set me on fire<br/>
I've never felt so alive, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Hoping wounds heal, but it never does<br/>
That's because you're at war with love<br/>
<br/>
And I'm at the point of breaking<br/>
And it's impossible to shake it<br/>
<br/>
See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does<br/>
That's 'cause you're at war with love<br/>
Hope it heals, but it never does<br/>
That's 'cause you're at war with love!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3x]</i><br/>
These battle scars don't look like they're fading<br/>
Don't look like they're ever going away<br/>
They ain't never gonna change<br/>
<br/>
These battle
