<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
When first she had on baby clothes<br/>
Then she had on young lady clothes<br/>
Mom tried to keep her out the sexy clothes<br/>
Prom night she wore dressy clothes<br/>
Prom night, took all night to get ready for<br/>
Retro now she want 80′s clothes<br/>
No colleges no scholarships so she put on some Navy clothes<br/>
Pregnant now its bigger clothes<br/>
Living in ?<br/>
Different girl when the liquor flow<br/>
Stripper name, stripper clothes<br/>
Stripper pose on stripper poles<br/>
Then take off her stripper clothes<br/>
Right in front them gigalo’s<br/>
Cocaine what she sniffin on<br/>
Burnt out, turnt out ? now she walk around in n-ggas clothes<br/>
Out the sag, out the bag<br/>
Goodwill got to give her clothes<br/>
Oh the humanity, like the ?<br/>
Richard Pryor lit on fire, she can’t tell what fit no more<br/>
and…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Who are you now,<br/>
It’s like everyday you change<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
Your style, your clothes, your name<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
So who are you now<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
<br/>
So you spend all your time to fit in line<br/>
To fit in the crowd and even in your mirror’s eyes<br/>
Yourself you can’t identify<br/>
And just like the Energiser rabbit<br/>
You just be spinning round<br/>
And as it intensifies, your life it de-materialises<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.o.B]</i><br/>
Today’s stylings, injecting like a virus<br/>
From TV screens to your iris<br/>
You buy what you are provided with<br/>
Whatever your size is<br/>
You lay it flat then iron it<br/>
And if you fight it, its like David verse Goliath<br/>
Cause that skin you supposed to hide it<br/>
Dress it up and deny it<br/>
Cant even go natural no more cause if do you probably wont get hired<br/>
So tell me who’s lying<br/>
If I am, I’m lying<br/>
On the ground but I’m flying<br/>
And they still tryna find me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Who are you now,<br/>
It’s like everyday you change<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
Your style your clothes your name<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
So who are you now<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
Who are you now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
