<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Peace<br/>
No material possessions shall cloud my judgement<br/>
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance<br/>
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this<br/>
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace<br/>
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast<br/>
Shed a new light on a new path<br/>
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath<br/>
Attain wisdom and refuse graph<br/>
And build upon what I built on<br/>
And wisely regulate time I do have<br/>
'Cause what is defeat?<br/>
But just the evidence of my haste<br/>
Lack of preparedness, in my waste<br/>
So I wait...<br/>
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'<br/>
Use natural codes of conduct to remove the schism when the rules missing<br/>
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity<br/>
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy<br/>
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships<br/>
Just invest in my business<br/>
And appreciative of the rarity of my existence<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I got chillin' by the million<br/>
Tranquillo by the kilo, nigga, nigga<br/>
And I got kilos by the speedboat<br/>
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout that love<br/>
For myself and all my niggas<br/>
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?<br/>
'Cause I got chillin' by the million<br/>
Tranquillo by the kilo, nigga, nigga<br/>
And I got kilos by the speedboat<br/>
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth<br/>
Of myself and all my niggas<br/>
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I got bitches on bitches<br/>
All my dreams and my visions<br/>
I remember me fishin' out of canals in the trenches<br/>
Now a nigga be flossy<br/>
Rolls Royce lookin' glossy<br/>
Quick to put down a demo to get these haters up off me<br/>
I like to smoke to myself<br/>
I just try to improve<br/>
Let my son hold my strap while I swim laps in the pool<br/>
Told my daughter the rules which we all must abide<br/>
Your daddy was far from perfect, things we did to survive<br/>
I just wanted to fly, they always lookin' down on us<br/>
School district full of killers, I mean these niggas ferocious<br/>
Only violence and drugs, there was nothin' for us<br/>
All I had was this music, I couldn't afford to do much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
'Cause I got chillin' by the million<br/>
Tranquillo by the kilo, nigga, nigga<br/>
And I got kilos by the speedboat<br/>
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout that love<br/>
For myself and all my niggas<br/>
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?<br/>
'Cause I got chillin' by the million<br/>
Tranquillo by the kilo, nigga, nigga<br/>
And I got kilos by the speedboat<br/>
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth<br/>
Of myself and all my niggas<br/>
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big K.R.I.T.:]</i><br/>
Young nigga say ball<br/>
'Cause he ain't really livin' life 'less he's down to roll the dice<br/>
Put it all on the line for a couple dollars<br/>
And a bad bitch that only think about him if he call<br/>
Is it really worth the time and the effort?<br/>
Chasin' wood grain and the leather<br/>
Puttin' pressure on the pedal, I don't want the devil<br/>
Hopin' he fall<br/>
Feed him to his nonsense, mothafuck a contract<br/>
You don't need a handout, they gon' bring the bands out<br/>
Choppas make 'em stand down, good lord<br/>
But you don't wanna be another nigga<br/>
Chase the figures that never really add up<br/>
White folk pass your face<br/>
Dyin' in the grass 'cause they wouldn't call the law<br/>
'Cause you're hooded, Black and they think you're sellin' crack<br/>
Maybe so, you don't give a fuck in a rut, nigga<br/>
'Til those in the street got you stuck, nigga, what, nigga?<br/>
Buck, buck, nigga<br/>
Buried your partner just the other day knowin' he was too young<br/>
Had a tool, tryna roll on the folk<br/>
Let it go on the folk<br/>
But he wasn't down to shoot one<br/>
Though the time dead and gone<br/>
Is YOLO what we on?<br/>
I heard different, it's never too late to listen<br/>
And be reborn<br/>
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga<br/>
Go be reborn<br/>
Peace and understanding is what you should be on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
'Cause I got chillin' by the million<br/>
Tranquillo by the kilo, nigga, nigga<br/>
And I got kilos by the speedboat<br/>
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout that love<br/>
For myself and all my niggas<br/>
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?<br/>
'Cause I got chillin' by the million<br/>
Tranquillo by the kilo, nigga, nigga<br/>
And I got kilos by the speedboat<br/>
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth<br/>
Of myself and all my niggas<br/>
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga
