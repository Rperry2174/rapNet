See I live it, Charlie<br/>
And then I write it, pimping<br/>
Then I record it, dirty<br/>
Then it's a song!<br/>
But then they hate on me<br/>
Cuz they can't take, homie<br/>
That I might break, homie<br/>
From my home<br/>
<br/>
Which is the west side<br/>
F I wicked as the witches from the<br/>
West side in the wizard<br/>
You see I live it, scribble it<br/>
Deliver it, then I distribute it<br/>
To my niggas, But yet I<br/>
For the life of me<br/>
Can't understand the rivalry<br/>
Said about my number one fan, my man<br/>
He used to ride with me<br/>
But now he spitefully uses fighting words to frighten me<br/>
Slightly perturbed I war at his words rightfully<br/>
I should be lightning like in his ass<br/>
But I pass and lightly brush off the ash<br/>
From the square of that square<br/>
You see I really don't care<br/>
But it's a whole lot of insulted niggas over here<br/>
Bear in mind some of them mind, all of them won't<br/>
Some of them rhyme, all of them don't<br/>
Most of them grind, all of them inclined<br/>
To see you signed and combined<br/>
To be on your ass so serious<br/>
<br/>
You see I live it, Charlie<br/>
And then I write it, pimping<br/>
Then I record it, dirty<br/>
Then it's a song!<br/>
But then they hate on me<br/>
Cuz they can't take, homie<br/>
That I might break, homie<br/>
From my home
