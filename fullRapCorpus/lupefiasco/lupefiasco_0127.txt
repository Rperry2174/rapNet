(Pow)<br/>
Thirty somethin' shots from the ghetto gun<br/>
All in the ears of the ghetto young<br/>
Some ghetto girls, some ghetto sons<br/>
Throwing rocks at the bus and other ghetto fun<br/>
I always wondered where the ghetto from<br/>
Cause I'm from the ghetto, the never ghetto come<br/>
But you win if the bell of my ghetto rung<br/>
But if the ghetto lose, that mean a ghetto won<br/>
That's how they do the ghetto, that's how the ghetto done<br/>
They keep it, they never bring the ghetto none<br/>
We make the ghetto tick, we make the ghetto run<br/>
We make the ghetto sick, we make the ghetto dumb<br/>
These niggas off that ghetto beer and that ghetto rum<br/>
And that ghetto bass with my ghetto drums<br/>
And my ghetto words and these ghetto problems<br/>
Get ghetto sums<br/>
That's why...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
The pizza man don't come here no more<br/>
Too much dope<br/>
Too many niggas on the porch<br/>
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)<br/>
Pizza man don't come here no more<br/>
Too many niggas on the block<br/>
Too many niggas gettin shot<br/>
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)<br/>
The pizza man don't come here no more<br/>
Too many niggas gettin robbed<br/>
Niggas don't wanna starve but<br/>
"Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"<br/>
The pizza man don't come here no more<br/>
Deliver, deliver, deliver<br/>
<br/>
Is it cause they're selling nicks out there all day<br/>
Cause a prostitute sucking dick in the hallway<br/>
Little Caesar's never sendin' pizza out ya'll way<br/>
Papa Johns never get delivered where y'all stayed<br/>
The Ghetto was a physical manifestation of hate<br/>
And a place where ethnicity determines your placement<br/>
A place that defines your station<br/>
Remind you niggas your place is the basement<br/>
White people in the attic<br/>
Niggas selling dope, White people is the addicts<br/>
White folks act like they ain't show us how to traffic<br/>
All that dope to China, you don't call that trappin'?<br/>
Breaking Bad, learned that from a TV<br/>
So don't say its politics when you see me<br/>
When you gon' apologize for your CD<br/>
Nigga that don't match red and black to a GD<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Can I get delivered from the sin and get a little slice of Heaven I can enter in again<br/>
Or maybe just imagine that I'm livin in a mansion or a palace and my pizza gets delivered in a Benz<br/>
Make a savior out of savage like they made it out of magic<br/>
So it take a nigga havoc and it make it into friends<br/>
You don't even need a salad, it don't make a nigga fatter<br/>
Actually take a nigga backwards and make a nigga thin<br/>
That's a deep dish<br/>
Chicago style get the peace stick<br/>
Homerunner hitter, I be drillin' on the weak pitch<br/>
Pay into the plate then I put it in your face<br/>
I'm a man, never bitin' on the hands that I eat with<br/>
No Giordano or Di Giorno<br/>
Homemade bull, they bring it to him like a toro<br/>
Throwing dough up in the air-bottom to the top and shredder full of cheese smarter than a purple ninja turtle<br/>
<br/>
