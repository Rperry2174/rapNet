<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Put one in the air like the king's son<br/>
For the heir to the kingdom<br/>
That means I'm a be the king once the king done<br/>
If he don't wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him<br/>
I sing some but I rap a lot like the king's son<br/>
Microphone checker all across the board you should king him<br/>
Diamond mine my mind make princesses like King Come<br/>
Every second worth of thinkin'<br/>
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringling's<br/>
That's how I kept it on the air; it's like a re-run<br/>
And kept the kings comin in obscene sums<br/>
See for me it's life or death like a king thumb<br/>
Mean something<br/>
That's why I don't play when I relay like a team run<br/>
And treat every single day like a scene one<br/>
Outlook on life like I ain't never seen none<br/>
Nigga, what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I keep my back to the past tell it bye bye<br/>
Face to the future tell it hi hi<br/>
Everything is super so is fly fly<br/>
Come and stick the fans up<br/>
Gon' and get your hands up high<br/>
High<br/>
High<br/>
High<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Post coast to coast, gotta dose of every lingo<br/>
The latest famous 80's baby like the dingo<br/>
Who evaded pushing daisies, dodge bullets like Remo<br/>
Remember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo<br/>
Used to be in awe at what the pushers and the pimps owned<br/>
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones<br/>
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones<br/>
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on<br/>
Even if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the end zone<br/>
From game one to the super like Karrine dome<br/>
That mean I went to Disney World and you just went home<br/>
It's Lupe and I ain't from there<br/>
But they root for the away<br/>
Yeah, they stunned there how eautifully I play<br/>
Gatorade the coach and tubas need to play now<br/>
Usually I stay; put'em on the roof for more truth for me to say<br/>
Nigga, what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
The laboratory happy for me cause I'm back with my belongings<br/>
Ferrari 'bout as ready as when Carrie was the prom queen<br/>
Think outside the box like Larry Merchant, Don King<br/>
The glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs<br/>
Yeah, keep'em in the air like a swan wing<br/>
And I'm a keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing<br/>
In my lil' shop with my terracotta pot<br/>
You be talkin' 'bout your kush, you should come and here my 'larm sing<br/>
So put'em up like a robbery<br/>
A Derrick Rose lob to me<br/>
And watch and see I alley-oop it properly<br/>
Football or volley-b, hock-e-ly or sock-e-ly<br/>
You just get the rock to me<br/>
Try and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie<br/>
I'll lock you in a locker, b<br/>
Like Bruce Leeroy, like Johnny in a locker see<br/>
Shocka Z, only think that Tupac is toppin' me<br/>
Hot as rocket bottoms or Kilauea lava<br/>
What<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
