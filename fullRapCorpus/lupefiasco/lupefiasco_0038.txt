I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't<br/>
Let you leave<br/>
I don't know what you want<br/>
You want more from me?<br/>
<br/>
She said to him<br/>
"I want you to be a father<br/>
He's your little boy and you don't even bother<br/>
Like "brother" without the R<br/>
And he's starting to harbor<br/>
Cool and food for thought<br/>
But for you he's a starver<br/>
Starting to use red markers on his work<br/>
His teacher say they know he's much smarter<br/>
But he's hurt<br/>
Used to hand his homework in first<br/>
Like he was the classroom starter<br/>
Burst to tears<br/>
Let them know she see us<br/>
Now he's fighting in class<br/>
Got a note last week that say he might not pass<br/>
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us<br/>
Cause you ain't never pick him up<br/>
You see what his problem is?<br/>
He don't know where his poppa is<br/>
No positive male role model<br/>
To play football and build railroad models<br/>
It's making a hole you've been digging it<br/>
Cause you ain't been kicking it<br/>
Since he was old enough to hold bottles<br/>
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that<br/>
He don't deserve to get used to that<br/>
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me<br/>
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard<br/>
Just breaks my heart<br/>
When I try to provide and he say 'Mommy that ain't your job'<br/>
To be a man, I try to make him understand<br/>
That I'm his number one fan<br/>
But its like he born from the stands<br/>
You know the world is out to get him, so why don't you give him a chance?"<br/>
<br/>
So he said to him<br/>
"I want you to be a father<br/>
I'm your little boy and you don't even bother<br/>
Like "brother" without the R<br/>
And I'm starting to harbor<br/>
Cool and food for thought<br/>
But for you I'm a starver<br/>
Starting to use red markers on my work<br/>
My teacher say they know I'm much smarter<br/>
But I'm hurt<br/>
I used to hand my homework in first<br/>
Like I was the classroom starter<br/>
Burst to tears<br/>
Let them know he see us<br/>
Now I'm fighting in class<br/>
Got a note last week that say I might not pass<br/>
Kids ask me if my daddy is sick of us<br/>
Cause you ain't never pick me up<br/>
You see what my problem is?<br/>
That I don't know where my poppa is<br/>
No positive male role model<br/>
To play football and build railroad models<br/>
It's making a hole you've been digging it<br/>
Cause you ain't been kicking it<br/>
Since I was old enough to hold bottles<br/>

I don't deserve to get used to that<br/>
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me<br/>
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard<br/>
Just breaks my heart<br/>
When my momma try to provide and I tell her 'That ain't your job'<br/>
To be a man, she try to make me understand<br/>
That she my number one fan<br/>
But its like you born from the stands<br/>
You know the world is out to get me, why don't you give me a chance?"
