Come, and bring the pieces to the master<br/>
He who organize by size then completes them with the plaster<br/>
Now, what should we call it?<br/>
After the 12 cocktails prevails the inner alcoholic<br/>
Who knelt you by the toilets?<br/>
Remember, remember? Just like the Knights of Malta<br/>
Niggas like their liquor malted, manifested like a land without the Indian<br/>
Just all kith and foul kin<br/>
Whether Maltese or Millennium<br/>
Saucer, Chaucer of the airwaves<br/>
Too assist once a nigga leaves, but her hair beige<br/>
The other's hair shaved<br/>
Both standin' at the bottom of the staircase poised<br/>
But boys too coy to look in their face<br/>
Oy bring the dabber, you can have 'em<br/>
On annual sabbatical, lookin' lousy in the cabin<br/>
Groomin's only prudent to continue working with humans<br/>
But ain't no livin' signals inside my circle of students<br/>
Huh, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Sirah:]</i><br/>
Lilies in the valley of my heart<br/>
Lay you on your back and fall apart<br/>
Lately I been looking at the sparks<br/>
It got my mind going back to Cali after dark<br/>
I got a problem with commitment I'd say<br/>
Laying here waiting on waves<br/>
To wash away the palisades<br/>
Buried as a barricade<br/>
Put the lily in the valley of my heart<br/>
<br/>
Leave, and take these pictures to the pawn shop<br/>
Tell 'em you want the same amount of money that the one got<br/>
Pull up on the side of his Ghost and let the Dijion drop<br/>
If they muster up the courage to murk us at the Quran swaps<br/>
For the ones that tell you how to orchestrate the bomb plots<br/>
Taught you well on how to tell the impostors<br/>
Made an inner city Mosque in Mississippi, Madrassas<br/>
Much like differences in instances, itty-bitty is topless<br/>
That was food for the fingers<br/>
Dim the lights to set the mood for the singers<br/>
Who can turn the stage into a school for the redeemers<br/>
Like an agent teaching Afghans to use the tool with the stingers<br/>
Useful as a back tire to a flat tire<br/>
A bazooka's your best friend until it backfires<br/>
Your strata needs a bunk bed ladder to climb up<br/>
And high hopes will put this whole matter behind us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Still, debunking the myth of a sleepover<br/>
As the enola sneaks over<br/>
The seat thinking ricolas fixes Ebola<br/>
Hol' up, heathens and thieves, in case police show up<br/>
Out the belly of the beast, making the streets blow up<br/>
Blowing in her hands, making the heat hold her us in streaks<br/>
All my skills on the hilltop, you can hear a quill drop<br/>
Spoon full of sugar help the pill pop<br/>
Let us Tetris, little blocks until the bill clots<br/>
And then fill spots and make the field drop<br/>
Levels, wearing the barren's medals<br/>
Otherwise bare expect for a pair of petals<br/>
Somethin' like a bear except he's wearing a pareo<br/>
Fair safe haven to take your share of De Niro<br/>
In his care, might square to a pair of you share hold<br/>
Heavily invested to bury every <i>[?]</i> now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
