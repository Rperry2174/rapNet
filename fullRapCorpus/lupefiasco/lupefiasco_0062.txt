I present, the death, of tha cool<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Lupe]</i><br/>
Well I heard like group of cows   <br/>
That all your enimies wanna shoot you down<br/>
They got ak 47's and a bunch of mac 11's <br/>
Semi automatic weapons that produce ka pows<br/>
Word on the street is, they all got heatas<br/>
They gon hit you up and you ain't even gon see it<br/>
You gotta lot of money, I ain't tryna be funny <br/>
But they say where you goin, you ain't even gon need it<br/>
They see you ridin round, shinin with your fine round diamonds<br/>
Pretty green eyed lady<br/>
Been on tha sideline poutin, while you primetime poppin<br/>
Hungry niggas want a peice of your pastry<br/>
I suggest you protect your bakery<br/>
Cause they comin for your head,<br/>
And its a bounty on that chain thats hangin from your neck<br/>
They said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don't know<br/>
What you been told in your ear, but I hear its goin down<br/>
Sombody gotta<br/>
DIE!!!<br/>
Don't know what you been told in your ear, but business goin round<br/>
Sombody gotta<br/>
DIE!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<i>[Gemstones]</i><br/>
Hitta nigga wit tha mini mac strap, clap<br/>
Any nigga think he gettin keys down here<br/>
Any meeta, any nigga gettin money, or my honey, man heard micheal young is the reclown? here<br/>
Run up on a nigga from tha back wit a mac<br/>
Or be strapped cause a nigga finna squeeze off 10<br/>
Run up on his nigga lac ratta tat tat, <br/>
Click clack where this nigga at<br/>
I need sin<br/>
Shit is goin down if i see him<br/>
Bump a nigga out like oxy ten<br/>
And keep a couple of dollas up in tha wallet<br/>
To pay they cops so they can never box me in<br/>
DIE!!!<br/>
Thats what im thinkin<br/>
While ridin around polishin this big pistol<br/>
Imma catch him in tha wind<br/>
Pray tha gun don't jam<br/>
So until we meet again<br/>
Nigga its cool!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don't know<br/>
What you been told in your ear, but I hear its goin down<br/>
Sombody gotta<br/>
DIE!!!<br/>
Don't know what you been told in your ear, but business goin round<br/>
Sombody gotta<br/>
DIE!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe chatter]</i><br/>
Man, man you can't  beleive none of that. Man you need just need to, you just need to relax<br/>
Man. Trust me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
<i>[Lupe]</i><br/>
Don't pay them niggas no mind<br/>
They hatin on you ain't nobody witta shotty<br/>
Planin on doin a robbery<br/>
Itchin to catch a body<br/>
Creepin in a stolen jalopy<br/>
Out there waitin on you<br/>
<i>[Gemstones]</i><br/>
sittin in a stolen car, finna rob this nigga<br/>
Should i let the mini mac or tha shotgun hit him?<br/>
I been waitin all day tryna spot this nigga<br/>
I can't let him get away, im gon pop this nigga! UHHHH<br/>
<i>[Lupe]</i><br/>
Plus they don't know about the choppa in tha trunk<br/>
Tha glocks in a box and tha nine on tuck<br/>
The bullet proof glass the 40's in tha stash<br/>
You pull tha steerin wheel and it pop on up<br/>
<i>[Gemstones]</i><br/>
40 caliber stashed up in tha stash box<br/>
Bullet proof windows, you couldn't break em wit a padlock<br/>
Ak in tha trunk, where tha sounds bump<br/>
Two twin glock 40's and a nine and this damn clock?<br/>
<i>[Lupe]</i><br/>
Maaaaaaan<br/>
We tryna go up in this club<br/>
Show a little love<br/>
Get a few drinks<br/>
Holla at some girls <br/>
Snatch up a pair<br/>
Leave outta there<br/>
Put some dro in tha air<br/>
And then go and get some grub<br/>
<i>[Gemstones]</i><br/>
We finna go up in tha club<br/>
Show a little love<br/>
Get a few drinks<br/>
Holla at some girls <br/>
Snatch up a pair<br/>
Leave outta there<br/>
Put some dro in tha air<br/>
And then catch a few slugs<br/>
<i>[Lupe]</i> ay pull over right here, i gotta take a pee<br/>
And don't go nowhere nigga wait for me<br/>
And if some niggas do kill you in the next few minutes<br/>
Just remember my nigga its a heaven for a G.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[music stops]</i><br/>
<i>[The cool plays on the radio inside of a car]</i><br/>

Fa sho. Ay man, ay don't leave i'll be right back.<br/>
