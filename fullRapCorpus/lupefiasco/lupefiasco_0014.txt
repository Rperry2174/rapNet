"Neeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrdd!"<br/>
<br/>
Westside, Baby<br/>
What's good?<br/>
I'm only gonna do this once, man<br/>
Once<br/>
Till the album come<br/>
So, check it out<br/>
<br/>
From the M-A...D-I to the S to the O-N<br/>
Po'in, to getcha open<br/>
Move like a nigga's supposed to get the dough<br/>
It'll go with the flow that I'm holdin'<br/>
Joe'n'em, they ownin' up - up on enough<br/>
Stay in the zone, that I go in<br/>
That I go in, when I go in and go in<br/>
Of the po'ins, and the rope man<br/>
Crucial conflict was smokin'<br/>
But a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'<br/>
So I proceed at low speed, low key<br/>
Like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'<br/>
Rollin', like a OZ in a B-league<br/>
Both pins, like a bowlin' ball when I ball<br/>
But I never fall for the oki-dokin'<br/>
White walls, with the slow-speed motion<br/>
Stash-box for the police pokin'<br/>
Rolie showin, shorty showin, Hokey Pokin'<br/>
Turnin it around with me to bust em down cuz they know he golden<br/>
Exactly<br/>
I'm in it from the minute I was in it till the minute<br/>
That I spit it and it's finished<br/>
And it's sad for me<br/>
Until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance<br/>
Revisit and make 'em give it<br/>
Back to me<br/>
<br/>
All right, that's all you get<br/>
I'm done<br/>
You know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
And the streets where they traffic me<br/>
Nigga what
