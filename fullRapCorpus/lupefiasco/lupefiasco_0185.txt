<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Lupe <i>[audience raving]</i><br/>
Ha ha<br/>
Young<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Ah<br/>
Ah, ah, oh my God<br/>
All this for me, I must be on my job<br/>
First album was a classic, never got an award<br/>
Took my first ten grand and bought a Honda Accord<br/>
And then I pack them things inside the Honda Accord<br/>
And put them on a highway and watch the Honda Accord<br/>
Excuse me Mr. Engineer, hope you pressin' record<br/>
And on behalf of the streets, I just can't be ignored (YEAH!)<br/>
Stagin' all black (black)<br/>
Just like a new glock<br/>
All the broads screamin' like they just seen 2Pac<br/>
Say his earrings 'bout as big as his ego<br/>
Keep a fresh bald head like he just left Kemo (AY!)<br/>
Yes, it ain't mine, this is Lupe's single<br/>
And every time I watch The Wire, it's like I just left Bmore (HA HA!)<br/>
Call me Marlo, come be my Snoopy<br/>
Superstar, baby, why wouldn't you do me (YO!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1: Mathew Santos]</i><br/>
If you are what you say you are<br/>
A superstar<br/>
Then have no fear<br/>
The camera's here<br/>
And the microphones<br/>
And they wanna' know<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
You on your fifteenth minute of fame and on the sixteenth<br/>
Beginith the lame, and on seventeen, you lose everything<br/>
The twenty-first is the worse, wishin' you was eleven<br/>
Poppin' like you was seven with the feelin' when you was seconds<br/>
Reminiscin' when you was just in<br/>
Now you just ten, no longer the trend they dressin'<br/>
Now you wonderin' where all the press went<br/>
You no longer impress them<br/>
Get arrested, paparazzi will press then <i>[camera flash]</i><br/>
I fell on purpose to stay a freshmen<br/>
I lose<br/>
But Lu, attend the school for X-Men<br/>
So when I get my cap and gown and put the rappin' down<br/>
I'll only know half my powers, but I spend half an hour<br/>
Like a senior citizen, havin' a baby shower<br/>
Haters wanna budget, but my fans still love it<br/>
So you can ask them exactly who I are<br/>
Nine weeks in number one, I'm a superstar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: Mathew Santos]</i><br/>
If you are what you say you are<br/>
A superstar<br/>
Then have no fear<br/>
The crowd is here<br/>
And the lights are on<br/>
And they want a show<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
OK now<br/>
Anyone who know me, they know me, to ride<br/>
But when the shit was sellin' slow, it's just my homies and I<br/>
Had to get rid of all the phonies and the homies' disguise<br/>
So you speak and I don't reply, homie, don't be surprised<br/>
You ain't gotta ride for me, I ain't asked you to<br/>
Take the journey on my own, I would gladly do<br/>
You gone and turn around, now, I'll call a cab for you<br/>
I stand up on my own two, me kiss the ass of who<br/>
No way, Jose, we pop Rose, blow dro, there's more, no case<br/>
But see, don't say my fault, ain't clip, more yay than Cirque Du Soleil<br/>
Keyser Soze, oh they kill people, kill people and get off like O.J.<br/>
You catch your case, just shut your face, don't get caught singin' do-re<br/>
Mi-fa-se<br/>
La-ti-do, ghetto, he wrote G Code, I obey <i>[audience raving]</i><br/>
He's so gaye<br/>
They handle them, he's hangin' 'round me, no way<br/>
It's OK<br/>
Life, listen, learn, I just let you go yo way<br/>
I be straight<br/>
No conversation, man, that's all I'm gone say<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus 1 &amp; 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Matthew Santos]</i><br/>
If you are<br/>
What you say you are<br/>
Then have no fear
