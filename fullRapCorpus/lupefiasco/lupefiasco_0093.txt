<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ohio<br/>
Tennessee<br/>
California<br/>
Endlessly<br/>
Right on, right on<br/>
Right on, right on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Laid back, villain on the smooth tip<br/>
All things gravy, greatest fear to let the groove slip<br/>
Always tell the masters that it's never gon' stop<br/>
Cause you never gon' do shit<br/>
Magnify justice over long lost blues riffs<br/>
Mop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip<br/>
They proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick<br/>
Remember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick<br/>
Or when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched<br/>
Sent the tape to Bill Duke, would've went to jail<br/>
If he wouldn't have got killed in that drive-by by the dude he kicked<br/>
Cause he was like, "It ain't mine"<br/>
And she was like, "You the only guy that I do it with"<br/>
Remember when 'Pac and Q start fightin' over Steel's house<br/>
They broke a vase, Steel scream, Raheem told 'em to chill out<br/>
The jheri curl Blood that bumped Ricky eating chips<br/>
The same guy they was looking for when Ice Cube stopped to let Cuba out the whip<br/>
And wan' it sad how Loco had to have it?<br/>
And wan' it funny when they caught T-Bone, dancing with that rabbit<br/>
Didn't rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnson's son in the back with<br/>
Or do I got it backwards<br/>
And Bobby Johnson was the one that put his fist up to the glass<br/>
And Caine put his fist up and dapped it<br/>
And Chicago and Regina had sex inside the mail truck<br/>
They left his ass, he reached down to get his hairbrush<br/>
And Tr√© lied to Furious, sitting down get his hair cut<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yeah, do you remember these<br/>
Double burger with cheese<br/>
Double burger with cheese<br/>
Double burger with cheese, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Caine told him as he jacked him at the drive-thru<br/>
A hundred bucks will tell who rider mask put the knife to<br/>
Another hundred for the cop who chased New Jersey Drive crew<br/>
The group who took Ricky ball, Crip or Piru<br/>
Kicked Doughboy and told him he could buy a hundred balls<br/>
Little Bobby used his bed to iron out his overalls<br/>
Who knew in a few he would have a gun aimed<br/>
Caine had a nigga's Daytons skatin' on his Mustang<br/>
Remember when the whole crowd stopped and got tense<br/>
Then they cheered when Steel put his hand up on the fence<br/>
Then when Gee Money first got mad to the cocaine<br/>
And Chris Tucker OD'ed there watching Soul Train<br/>
Cam'ron shot him in the car and took his gold chain<br/>
Nino was free till he met up with that old man<br/>
And Ice-T was there and he oversaw the whole thing<br/>
Mello lost his legs just to get up out the dope game<br/>
Why he throw his gun into the river, though?<br/>
Just to hit the roof to get the juice and let Bishop go<br/>
Show Hodges love, but the Pac Man day came<br/>
'Specially after sprayed little ese with the spray paint<br/>
Remember when Bobby took off his tear<br/>
And when Doughboy disappeared<br/>
After his brother died and he said nobody cared<br/>
I still do, after all these years<br/>
Because he should've played ball<br/>
Ricky ain't deserve none of that at all<br/>
These are just a illustration<br/>
Of a few scenes that helped raise a generation<br/>
<br/>
