<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
You would never know<br/>
If you could ever be<br/>
If you never try<br/>
You would never see<br/>
Stayed in Africa<br/>
We ain’t never leave<br/>
So there were no slaves in our history<br/>
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn’t he<br/>
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Uh, and we ain’t get exploited<br/>
White man ain’t feared so he did not destroy it<br/>
We ain’t work for free, see they had to employ it<br/>
Built it up together so we equally appointed<br/>
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it<br/>
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois<br/>
Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided<br/>
Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer<br/>
Extra extra on the news stands<br/>
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan<br/>
Malcolm Little dies as a old man<br/>
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him<br/>
Followed by Bill O’Reilly who read from the Quran<br/>
President Bush sends condolences from Iran<br/>
Where FOX News reports live<br/>
That Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
You would never know<br/>
If you could ever be<br/>
If you never try<br/>
You would never see<br/>
Stayed in Africa<br/>
We ain’t never leave<br/>
So there were no slaves in our history<br/>
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn’t he<br/>
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uh, and it ain’t no projects<br/>
Keepin it real is not an understood concept<br/>
Yea, complexion’s not a contest<br/>
Cause racism has no context<br/>
Hip hop ain’t got a section called conscious<br/>
Everybody rappin’ like crack never happened<br/>
Crips never occurred no Bloods to attack them<br/>
Matter of fact no hood to attack in<br/>
Somalia is a great place to relax in<br/>
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin<br/>
The Rat Pack was cool group of black men<br/>
That inspired five white guys called The Jacksons<br/>
Eminem fitted in but then again he inspired a black rapper tryin to mimic him<br/>
And that’s what really rose up out of Michigan, the sign of white rapper by the name of 50 Cent, ha!<br/>
<br/>

Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn’t he<br/>
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Uh, and I know it’s just a fantasy<br/>
I cordially invite you to ask why can’t it be?<br/>
Now we can do nothing bout the past<br/>
But we can do something about the future that we have<br/>
We can make fast or we can make it last<br/>
Every woman Queenin’ and every man a Kingin’<br/>
When those color lines come we can’t see between<br/>
We just close our eyes ’til it’s all black every-THING!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

If you could ever be<br/>

We ain’t never leave<br/>
So there were no slaves in our history<br/>
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn’t he<br/>
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything
