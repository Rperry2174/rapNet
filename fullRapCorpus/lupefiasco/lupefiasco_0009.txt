<i>[LUPE]</i><br/>
Yeeeah <br/>
Pooh bear, lupe, eva <br/>
Happy birthday <br/>
You know, ha <br/>

Ya'sayin, slow down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[EVA]</i><br/>
<i>[verse 1]</i><br/>
Gotta be careful <br/>
Cos nobody's gona care for you <br/>
Like you do (like you) <br/>
And nobody's gona have your back <br/>
Like you do (you do) <br/>
Just be sure before you go and make (and make) <br/>
A move (a move) <br/>
You've got the world to lose <br/>
<br/>
<i>[bridge]</i><br/>
You need to stop and listen <br/>
Cos every word i say is true <br/>
Try to pay attention <br/>
Cos I'm just tryna watch out for you <br/>
I know you're on a mission <br/>
I see how you're livin <br/>
Chu don't wana end'up missin <br/>
I think you oughta listen to me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
I'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) <br/>
Before you hurt yourself <br/>
I'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) <br/>
It's just not worth it <br/>
I'm savin tens (I'm savin tens) <br/>
For a rainy day (for a rainy day) <br/>
Just slow down (slow it all the way down) <br/>
I'd slow down (just slow it all the way down) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 2]</i><br/>
You're so innocent <br/>
They're gona try to run a game (a game) <br/>
On you (on you) <br/>
Just be aware of all the lies <br/>
That they use (they use) <br/>
I can't help it <br/>
Cos I've been <br/>
In your shoes (your shoes) <br/>
I'm givin you the rules (the rules) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[bridge]</i><br/>
You need to stop and listen <br/>
Cos every word i say is true <br/>
Try to pay attention <br/>
I'm just tryna watch out for you <br/>
<br/>
I know you're on a mission <br/>
I see how you're living <br/>
But chu don't wanna end'up missin <br/>
I think you oughta listen to me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
I'd slow down <br/>
Slow down (all the way down, down, down) <br/>
Before you hurt yourself <br/>
I'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) <br/>
It's just not worth it <br/>
I'm savin tens (I'm savin tens) <br/>
For a rainy day (for a rainy day) <br/>
Just slow down (slow it all the way down) <br/>
I'd slow down (just slow it all the way down) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[LUPE]</i><br/>
You movin too fast <br/>
You movin too quick <br/>
You heavy on the gas <br/>
You movin too swift <br/>
Can't keep up the pace <br/>
Might not finish the race <br/>
But do it now for it's too late to switch <br/>
And how you make a impala lift <br/>
But the set card is ya heart <br/>
And is hard to be fixed <br/>
You gon break it if you don't downshift <br/>
And I know you get a rush when you hang around risk <br/>
But you gon get enough when you breakin down sick <br/>
All ill cant move your wheels and feelin like shhh <br/>
Just a mile back you was feelin quite brisk <br/>
Now you sittin on bricks, wit ya car on strict <br/>
Radio gone <br/>
Insurance won't cover <br/>
Paint job wreck <br/>
And you draggin your muffler <br/>
Wouldn't listen then, but i bet you hear now <br/>
Cos you gotta speed ticket <br/>
Cos you wouldn't slow down, yeeeah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[EVA]</i><br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
I'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) <br/>
Before you hurt yourself <br/>
I'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) <br/>
It's just not worth it <br/>
I'm savin tens (I'm savin tens) <br/>
For a rainy day (for a rainy day) <br/>
Just slow down (slow it all the way down) <br/>
I'd slow down (just slow it all the way down)
