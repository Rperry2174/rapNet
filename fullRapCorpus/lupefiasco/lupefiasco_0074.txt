The game was looking weak, the whole scene starved<br/>
So I came through with some Muscle Milk and protein bars<br/>
Barbells and jump ropes, Bowflexes to body it<br/>
And a couple Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Karate kicks<br/>
If you ain't Million Dollar Dreaming then we opposites<br/>
In high school I was voted the most Ted DiBiase-est<br/>
Also the most slept on, cause my Ted DiBiase-ness<br/>
An (Inglorious Bastard) and you looking like a Nazi bitch<br/>
They say it's hard out here for old boy, then tell me where Taraji is<br/>
I am going so raw watch me Soy Sauce, Wasabi this<br/>
Nobu/noble on them Pro-Tools, hot as H-E- double hockey sticks<br/>
Make sure you give the chef your compliments<br/>
And thank him for his constantly great tasting accomplishments<br/>
A smiley face, emoticons if you want to remain anonymous<br/>
My retirement's on hold, I got the whole world on conference<br/>
Matchstick Man, I really have the confidence<br/>
That I'm a give them G.O.O.D Music like Common Sense and Consequence<br/>
Content that's relative across the continent<br/>
New York, Houston, Chi-Town, Los Angeles<br/>
Enemy
