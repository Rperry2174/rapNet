<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This world, my heart, my soul.<br/>
Things that I don't know.<br/>
The icicles they grow.<br/>
They never let me go.<br/>
Scars are left as proof.<br/>
But tears they soak on through.<br/>
Things I've done.<br/>
My young.<br/>
My unforgivable youth.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
We land on the horizon. The passion in their eyes then.<br/>
What they think of islands and much more in their size.<br/>
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them.<br/>
Supplies slim. Morale when so heavily inside them.<br/>
Now steadily declining. <br/>
Return is not an option as necessity denies them. <br/>
With this they choose to dive in.<br/>
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving.<br/>
Other children of this land prepare to share in their surviving.<br/>
A pigeontry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure.<br/>
Now the material things that kings that could never last forever.<br/>
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together.<br/>
Unbenounced to him his head would be the first that they would sever.<br/>
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach. <br/>
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs.<br/>
And so began it here. And for 500 years. <br/>
Torture, Terror, Fear til they nearly disappear.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This world, my heart, my soul.<br/>
Things that I don't know.<br/>
The icicles they grow.<br/>
They never let me go.<br/>
Scars are left as proof.<br/>
But tears they soak on through.<br/>
Things I've done.<br/>
My young.<br/>
My unforgivable youth.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ways and means from mistreated human beings. <br/>
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine. <br/>
And helps the new regime establish and expand. <br/>
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land. <br/>
From native caretakers who can barely understand. <br/>
"How can land be owned by another man. Warns one can not steal what was given as a gift. Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish." <br/>
But the lesson when the heated, for the sake of what's not needed. <br/>
You kill but do not eat it. <br/>
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it. <br/>
The forests's were cleared, the factories were built. <br/>
And your mistakes will be repeated by your future generation doomed to pay for your mistreatments. <br/>
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement. <br/>
And you rushed to have the most, from the day you left your boats. <br/>
You'll starve but never die. In a world of hungry ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This world, my heart, my soul.<br/>
Things that I don't know.<br/>
The icicles they grow.<br/>
They never let me go.<br/>
Scars are left as proof.<br/>
But tears they soak on through.<br/>
Things I've done.<br/>
My young.<br/>
My unforgivable youth.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east.<br/>
Appeared 100 meters wide and 100 meters deep.<br/>
They discover ancient cars on even older streets.<br/>
And a city well preserved and most likely at it's peak.<br/>
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth.<br/>
They can tell that they was civil, not barbaric in the least.<br/>
A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all.<br/>
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall.<br/>
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all.<br/>
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved.<br/>
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade.<br/>
Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved.<br/>
Assumed they had clean energy, but took to no enemies.<br/>
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies.<br/>
Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out.<br/>
And this must be the temple.<br/>
This White. House<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This world, my heart, my soul.<br/>
Things that I don't know.<br/>
The icicles they grow.<br/>
They never let me go.<br/>
Scars are left as proof.<br/>
But tears they soak on through.<br/>
Things I've done.<br/>
My young.<br/>
My unforgivable youth.
