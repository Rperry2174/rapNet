<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uuhhh<br/>
He's meannnnnn<br/>
And vicious<br/>
I can't believe he's that rude<br/>
To those stories those rhymes that jew<br/>
Then he put 'em on the floor like cat food (meow)<br/>
And put 'em on the track like glue<br/>
Then put 'em on your head like hat<br/>
Hey back to you Lu black power<br/>
I'm just running with a barrel full of black powder<br/>
With a hole in it hole in it wheezin deep, breathing<br/>
Running from the fire on the trail I keep leaving<br/>
I can't shake it I swear it's heat seeking<br/>
I keep seeking somewhere to hide from it I can die from it<br/>
But it keep keeping up just when I think that I've done it<br/>
It keep sneakin up<br/>
Ohh leaking barrel of black powder how that flame keep reaching us<br/>
Just one of the long rended extended metaphors a lose<br/>
This time I use an example of a fuse<br/>
To demonstrate how I can't lose<br/>
I would put it down but I can't due to the glue<br/>
That I use the fuse everything together<br/>
Well I spill some on my hands<br/>
And God Damn I might have to carry this forever<br/>
Well I'm crazy to the game till they bury me insane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side of chicago<br/>
Liked his hat to the left side<br/>
Wasn't in a gang but he was prone to bang<br/>
Doing his thanngg doin his thang<br/>
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side of chicago<br/>
Liked his hat to the left side<br/>
Wasn't in a gang but he was known to bang (uuhh) like<br/>
Doing his thanngg (yeah) doin his thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Truthfully I have trouble with second verses<br/>
Cause the first one be so intimidating<br/>
It'd be bullying and picking on it instigating<br/>
Pointing out all the second ones limitations<br/>
Like you ain't nothing but an imitation<br/>
Like betcha baking then it gets the chorus<br/>
And the beat to together then they gang up on him and get to hating<br/>
But then around the 8th bar he tired<br/>
So they conspire and comiserating then he find his inspiration<br/>
To spar he takes a few seconds of judo lessons<br/>
Gets back on beat then punches the guitar<br/>
They stand in awe like when did you write that<br/>
They even right black<br/>
First verse already happened<br/>
So he don't have a chance to fight back<br/>
I like that<br/>
Abagnale Junior check me<br/>
You gonna respect me<br/>
A 8 track listen to em feelin himself<br/>
Swagger up and a few ad libs to back it up<br/>
Let's back it up<br/>
I think you've had enough<br/>
Give me my mic back<br/>
You ain't even write that<br/>
Oh it's like that<br/>
Track stop pumping till this nigga stop fronting<br/>
Yeah yeah now right back
