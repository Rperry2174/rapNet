<i>[Intro: x2]</i><br/>
Let's peruse the essential of cool<br/>
A brief study of the things so instrumental to you<br/>
That make me feel flyer than lobbys at bellevues<br/>
An exclaimer just aramore no credentials from a school<br/>
Now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
In my Fall of Rome jeans, my headporter wallet<br/>
My Neighborhood shirt and my Eddie Chen clock shit<br/>
My not go to college but my street smart polished<br/>
Like the black finger nails of that punk rock logic<br/>
Do the knowledge, man you can't be punk from projects<br/>
Firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise<br/>
Was trading off my comics I was taking them to school<br/>
One of Jay-z's boys now I'm skating in your pools<br/>
Not to be rude I'm just hating on your rules<br/>
Like a young fifty I'm on my world tour<br/>
Good morning Singapore I'm bringing the sun with me<br/>
From the Robert Taylor homes to African slum cities<br/>
I am American mentally with Japanese tendencies<br/>
Parisian sensibilities so stay out the vicinity of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Yea, yea she loves it over here<br/>
It's just, yea, yea now look at what I wear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Got my gold watch<br/>
And my gold chain<br/>
With my fancy car<br/>
And my diamond ring<br/>
With my fancy broad<br/>
And she full grain<br/>
So it's no words<br/>
And it's no slang<br/>
And I'm no trick<br/>
And I'm no lame<br/>
It's just so sick<br/>
That she's so game<br/>
It's just yea, yea she loves it over here <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
I like zip-t, candles and Maharishi sandals<br/>
And Dita sunglasses and Purple Murder Service samples<br/>
I like false t-shirts though the street is off the handle<br/>
Such a good designer Junya Wantanabe got genu<br/>
I like Yohji Yamamoto and I might roll solo<br/>
Leather Gucci belts and Guilty Brotherhood polos<br/>
I like Mont Blanc pens and Moleskine paper<br/>
I like go-yard bags and green Now-n-Laters<br/>
Monical magazines and Japanese manga<br/>
Futura Nosferatu's and HTM trainers<br/>
I like street fighter 2 I just really hate Zangief<br/>
If only Ken and Ryu I find it hard to beat Blanca<br/>
I keep a Wii Nun-chuk hanging and a uncle album banging<br/>
If you negative in energy stay of the vicinity of...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Got my gold watch<br/>
And my gold chain<br/>
With my fancy car<br/>
And my diamond ring<br/>
With my ghetto broad<br/>
And she's so plain<br/>
Gotta couple SCARS<br/>
And one of those long names<br/>
And she fight a nigga<br/>
And cusses wit no shame<br/>
And her ex-man had her baggin up cocaine<br/>
But she..<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
It's just yea, yea she loves it over here<br/>
<br/>
And my most coveted thing is my high self-esteem<br/>
And the low tolerance for them telling me how to lean<br/>
See the most important parts are the ones that are unseen<br/>
See the wings don't make you fly and the crown don't make you king<br/>
Now God don't like ugly, ain't too happy bout pretty<br/>
I am ignorance's enemy so stay out of the vicinity of...<br/>
<br/>
Yea, Yea the niggas over there<br/>
Yea, Yea now look at what I wear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat chorus]</i>
