I'm just a wolf inside a lion's suit<br/>
A shark shirt, a panther's pants, piranha hat and tiger shoes<br/>
I got a lion's den inside the booth<br/>
That right there is point blank<br/>
This here is from where the sniper shoot<br/>
Might take a long time to get it, by the time I hit it<br/>
I done ran Bubble Tape around them Chiclets, poof<br/>
I ain't the bomb, I'm the company that got the contract<br/>
to rebuild during the aftermath - have a blast<br/>
Going green only using half the gas<br/>
the calming comes through after disasters have<br/>
But this calm has the same fury that disasters have<br/>
I should have a class, I'm the son/sun of the South Pole plus Alaska's dad<br/>
Got niggas like "DAG!!", flow is like crazy gone mad<br/>
And villains gone bad, Punk ass niggas, don't be so Daft<br/>
Baby, why you hanging with them Busters like Babs?<br/>
They are such a drag, you should move them to the trash<br/>
Feel like I'm walking round upon Cassius calves<br/>
Quite a beautiful script, and such a gift of gab<br/>
A big bass, shout out to Mistah F.A.B<br/>
Young Frankenstein reporting live from the lab<br/>
I bought the bars out, put it on my tab<br/>
If you came here to box, you'll leave in a bag<br/>
I run the game, Bilderberg Group, in the lead with the flash<br/>
Usain Bolt ain't even leaving this fast<br/>
Why you take offense with your defensive ass?<br/>
Never Hussein-ing the hole/whole, not even in the half<br/>
Cause nigga I ain't hiding, I'm the whole world, nigga you're an island<br/>
And the sea's rising, if I keep shining<br/>
You going have to take submarines to the drive-in now
