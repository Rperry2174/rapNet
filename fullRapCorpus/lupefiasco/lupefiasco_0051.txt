<i>[Crowd cheering]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Matthew Santos]</i><br/>
If you are what you say you are, a superstar<br/>
Then have no fear, the camera is here<br/>
And the microphones<br/>
And they wanna know oh oh oh oh (the return)<br/>
If you are what you say you are, a superstar<br/>
Then have no fear, the crowd is here<br/>
And the lights are on<br/>
And they wanna show oh oh oh oh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
A fresh cool young Lu'<br/>
Tryna catch his microphone check 2, 1, 2<br/>
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue<br/>
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?<br/>
Did you improve on the design? Did you do somethin' new?<br/>
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?<br/>
You! The more famous person you come through<br/>
And the sexy lady next to you, you cum too<br/>
And then it hit me<br/>
Standin' outside of heaven waitin' for God to come and get me<br/>
I'm too uncool<br/>
Unschooled to the rules and too gum shoe<br/>
Too much of a new comer and too un-cool<br/>
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well<br/>
Tho I need holiday like lady who sung "Blue"<br/>
Go back, whatever you did you undo<br/>
Heavy as heaven<br/>
The devil on me, two ton's too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Matthew Santos]</i><br/>
If you are what you say you are, a superstar<br/>
Then have no fear, the camera is here<br/>
And the microphones<br/>
And they wanna' know oh oh oh oh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
And you better wear your shades<br/>
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage<br/>
Down to the basement pass the Indian graves<br/>
Where the dinosaurs laid<br/>
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners<br/>
Magnified times five, 'less it's pointed at the rhymer<br/>
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze<br/>
Now that's important to say<br/>
'Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade<br/>
We want it to braid, meaning we want it to grow<br/>
Meaning we want it to stay<br/>
Like the Governor called and he told him to Wait<br/>
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his Cage<br/>
The audience ain't fazed<br/>
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise<br/>
They want everything back that they've paid<br/>
'Cause they've been waitin' since ten to see the lights get dim<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Matthew Santos]</i><br/>
If you are what you say you are, a superstar<br/>
Then have no fear, the crowd is here<br/>
And the lights are on<br/>
And they wanna show oh oh oh oh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away<br/>
'Cause I've been standin' in this line for like five whole days<br/>
Me and security ain't getting' along<br/>
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone<br/>
So just take me home where the mood is mellow<br/>
And the roses are grown, M&amp;M's are yellow<br/>
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker<br/>
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture<br/>
One for you and one for your sister<br/>
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener<br/>
Every songs her favorite song and mics don't feedback<br/>
All the reviewers say "You need to go and see that"<br/>
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased<br/>
And then they all take the stage and start performin' for me<br/>
Like, ha ha ha ha ha<br/>
Ha ha ha ha ha, ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Matthew Santos]</i><br/>
If you are what you say you are, a superstar<br/>
Then have no fear, the camera's is here<br/>
And the microphone's<br/>
And they wanna know oh oh oh oh<br/>
If you are what you say you are, a superstar<br/>
Then have no fear, the crowd is here<br/>
And the lights are on<br/>
And they wanna show oh oh oh oh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
If you are, what you say you are<br/>
Then have no fear
