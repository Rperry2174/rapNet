<i>[Hook: Pooh Bear]</i><br/>
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor<br/>
Everything I got, I give it all to you<br/>
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you<br/>
Cause I'm a heart donor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm just a conduit<br/>
To keep you calm through it<br/>
So you respond lucid<br/>
That mean you're not foolish<br/>
When it's gone, stupid<br/>
You think you gonna lose it<br/>
But you don't bounce, you just bond to it<br/>
Like you Sean Con or Gorilla Glue-ish<br/>
With a blonde in your palm, King Kong in your coolness<br/>
But they still tryna knock you off the roof kid<br/>
Singing you the blues, you crayon up the music<br/>
Change it in the rainbows and rubics<br/>
Keep telling yourself you the wave of the future Howard Hughes is<br/>
It's huge if you refuse to blow your fuses<br/>
You blow up, exactly how Lu did<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Pooh Bear]</i><br/>
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor<br/>
Everything I got, I give it all to you<br/>
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you<br/>
Cause I'm a heart donor<br/>
Cause I'm a heart donor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I hope my stories can keep you off Maury<br/>
Away from a lawyer, far from a mandatory<br/>
Which means, through the mail the only way you see yo shorties<br/>
Keep your sons out the slums and your daughters out of orgies<br/>
Look in the mirror, see yourself and adore thee<br/>
Whisper in your ear, I fear nothing that's before me<br/>
And always remember that you're royalty<br/>
From the line drawn to this Porky<br/>
And everything that's in between<br/>
Make sure you cherish every scene<br/>
And put on the biggest show your adversaries ever seen<br/>
Now even if you've never limousined<br/>
Important, yeah you're very there<br/>
There's red carpet everywhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Pooh Bear]</i><br/>
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor<br/>
Cause everything I got, I give it all to you<br/>
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you<br/>
Cause I'm a heart donor<br/>
Cause I'm a heart donor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Just know I got your back, yeah I got it, and I'ma go to bat<br/>
Like Gotham's under attack I will spot em,<br/>
Keep you from ever touching the mat<br/>
Be your Robin, bring that onomatopoeia<br/>
Down upon all your problems like "zap! boom! bang!"<br/>
Cause all y'all my pals<br/>
I tribune on your tribulations, channel through your trials<br/>
Please God, help keep the value in my vows<br/>
A man of my words that Vanna turns around<br/>
And if your fortune turns, I never turn you down<br/>
No matter who your healthcare provider, I'm a rider<br/>
Even if I gotta bring the fibulators out<br/>
A John Q on cue just for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Pooh Bear]</i><br/>
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor<br/>
Cause everything I got, I give it all to you<br/>
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you<br/>
Cause I'm a heart donor<br/>
Cause I'm a heart donor
