<i>[Intro/Chorus]</i><br/>
Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks<br/>
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks<br/>
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands<br/>
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons<br/>
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners<br/>
<br/>
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty<br/>
Be it Inglewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad<br/>
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago<br/>
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block<br/>
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot<br/>
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin<br/>
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton<br/>
Or whatever they sellin in your food desert<br/>
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed<br/>
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues<br/>
The new Jim Crow caged bird sings<br/>
Cause he's tired of occupying his misery and of our marching<br/>
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness<br/>
But his school on academic probation<br/>
They gave him medicine, diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation<br/>
So he refuses to cease the firin, nobody's hirin<br/>
In Illinois, 67 is the new age when you retirin<br/>
Class lines have blurred, those who used to have, have not<br/>
Pensions bein snatched<br/>
Those who never have keep their hands stretched<br/>
Social services being cut<br/>
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb<br/>
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs<br/>
Thinkin protests are temporary and trendy<br/>
Well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster<br/>
And two weeks later it's back to normal<br/>
But they say times are changin'<br/>
The revolution is becoming second nature, causes are combining<br/>
People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands<br/>
Attaching explosive devices cause they keep stealing their lands<br/>
In the name of freedom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
