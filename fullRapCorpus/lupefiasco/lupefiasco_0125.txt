It’s for the love<br/>
Cause we love you so much<br/>
Keep it real<br/>
I don’t feel, feel love<br/>
You don’t feel what I feel so<br/>
It all started out<br/>
<br/>
See first they had patience<br/>
And the nigga had energy<br/>
But not weak, he finna leave<br/>
Petal to the metal, you finna speed<br/>
You remind me of, <i>[?]</i><br/>
But off in the future, and what it’s finna be<br/>
All your memories can become enemies<br/>
So let’s intercede I know you in the seat<br/>
But let’s get outta that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1 - Nikki Jean &amp; Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
But then that patience turned to waiting<br/>
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting my time, my time, my time<br/>
And then that wasting turned to hating<br/>
And then that hating got to racing<br/>
All around my mind, my mind, my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 - Nikki Jean &amp; Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes<br/>
Just walk away no scratches<br/>
<br/>
(See first they had patience)<br/>
<br/>
But niggas start sick, niggas start gettin’ ill<br/>
Niggas got cold feet, niggas start gettin’ chills<br/>
Niggas start stayin’ home cause niggas start gettin’ bills<br/>
Buildin’ up an immunity<br/>
Niggas stopped getting’ hurt<br/>
Niggas relied on faith<br/>
Hopin’ niggas get healed is hopeless nigga, get real<br/>
But ah, get back on the pill<br/>
We in it for the feel<br/>
But even winners can <i>[?]</i> patience<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
(First we had patience)<br/>
<br/>
Mini-Bar raided, in the indy car faded<br/>
500 miles, it’s pretty far ain’t it?<br/>
But it’s a pretty car, ain’t it?<br/>
Pretty hard painted<br/>
But pretty darn dangerous<br/>
But we ain’t get the memo, hangin’ out the window<br/>
They don’t care no more<br/>
Tryna take his mini to a limo<br/>
Without a helmet then you can Thelma-it<br/>
Louis, Louise but we on the same thing<br/>
So I be James Dean<br/>
So your wreck and my wreck look like the same scene<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i>
