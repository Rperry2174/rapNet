<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
War gives value to life by showing it can be taken away<br/>
And in a perverted way, those who wage war delude themselves into thinking they create life<br/>
Or at least make it meaningful<br/>
Thus, using that as a basis for grandiose notions of supremacy<br/>
Falsely giving themselves the title of masters of the universe<br/>
And gatekeepers of morality<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Peace trials and living power pleasure over pain<br/>
Geiger counters check amounts of radiation in the rain<br/>
Biochemical nuke, gas masks and rubber boots<br/>
Inhale your last gasp without a Hazmat suit<br/>
Terrible, unbearable miracle of the modern scientific<br/>
Arms race, chase for the horrific<br/>
Manhattan project, man cancelling concept<br/>
Catastrophic bomb, a fabric-shattering context<br/>
A little boy falling from a metal bird<br/>
Followed by a fat man who left behind a leveled earth<br/>
Imbalanced challenge to survival of the whole piece<br/>
Have seeked to staff the whole planet with their own peeps<br/>
A zone beeps of contaminated contents<br/>
Atomically activated, saturated beyond its<br/>
Limits, to live within its boundaries with conscience<br/>
To cancer cells, I'm not totally unresponsive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cause in future's shock, there where everything's storied<br/>
I don't feel like there's anything for me<br/>
I hope they put this out<br/>
Cause in future's shock, there where everything's storied<br/>
I don't feel like there's anything for me<br/>
I hope they figure out<br/>
This atomic misphilosophy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uninhabitable avenues, third wars in southern latitudes<br/>
Mutually assured that it all happens to<br/>
International violence leaves us black and blue<br/>
Blast us back into the past if attack ensues<br/>
A pack-approved tactic fully practiced<br/>
On the evil of the axis back in World War Two<br/>
The melted lunchbox of a disintegrated girl<br/>
Dogs on fighters, mosquitoes, flies and squirrels<br/>
Men, women and children have their bones cooked to ash<br/>
And their shadows burning to the ground from the flash<br/>
And if they didn't pass what's the future, Hibakusha?<br/>
You say you need a job, but they won't give it to ya<br/>
In the era where they said the greatest evil was that white man<br/>
From the reich land, but this was coming from the same people<br/>
Who thought that Jim Crow was all 'ight then'<br/>
Same thing that kept Colonel Tibbets on his flight plan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Nuclear stockpile's America's second largest<br/>
The world's most destructive and the world's most heartless<br/>
Under the auspices that war will be rendered harmless<br/>
And everlasting peace will be in reach if we just bomb shit<br/>
Technologically fanatic racial socio-<br/>
Economic faux-intellectual fucking nonsense<br/>
Dripping with political interludes, typical of a system<br/>
Stark raving mad and operating unconscious<br/>
Now how do we proceed?<br/>
Knowing through the man's fatalism<br/>
And probably you'll never leave<br/>
A disease trying to cure its own symptoms with disease<br/>
Creating an epidemic just to see if it can be<br/>
Genuine mistrust of everything but us<br/>
Based on artificial evidence, but mostly racists at the crux<br/>
Let's pray they throw 'em all out<br/>
And I hope I don't see you<br/>
Through the foggy field of vision in the fall out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
