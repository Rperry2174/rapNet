<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Uh, before we get started in this<br/>
You know this thing right here<br/>
I gotta say<br/>
Welcome home<br/>
To my main man Chilly Mac<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Before we get started in here<br/>
I'd like to tell the world that my partner is here<br/>
Been on 23 and 1 for like 14 months (damn!)<br/>
That's the boss of first and fifteen is home chumps<br/>
Thanks to god for removing the obstacle<br/>
Thanks to Craig for making it possible<br/>
Million-dollar bond is what held us down<br/>
Now who in the hell is gonna help them now<br/>
You see CK cuz that check you cut<br/>
You got a couple fools on your set, what up<br/>
See his mind is sharp and mine is art<br/>
Refined and smart and it's time to start<br/>
While you was behind them bars I was behind these bars<br/>
Rewind to when the police took our cars<br/>
But they don't know there's more where that came from<br/>
Me and Chilly Mac back to backin' some<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
See the game ain't the same since you left out<br/>
See the snakes and the lames yeah they crept out<br/>
Ooh you know we need ya<br/>
Ooh I'm glad they freed ya<br/>
Here is where we need ya<br/>
Hey it's nice to see ya<br/>
Welcome back welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac<br/>
Welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac<br/>
Welcome back welcome back welcome back Chilly<br/>
Welcome back welcome back welcome back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You ain't even gonna dwell in the past tense<br/>
I gotta say one love<br/>
To that boy Sean Carter for holdin the young nigga down<br/>
While you was absent<br/>
Make sure my foot was good and my hand was pimp<br/>
And when them niggas jumped ship<br/>
A hand was limp<br/>
To try and turn the tide help withstand the stint<br/>
The time when it was hectic strictly on the strength<br/>
That's why we got moves to make<br/>
New records to record, new rules to break<br/>
We back standing on two the crew is straight<br/>
New and improved FNF crew you snakes<br/>
How they gon' stop us police still watch us but it's cool cuz you're home dog<br/>
No more visits on Friday, no more commissary, no more collect phone calls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
See the game ain't the same since you left out<br/>
See the snakes and the lames yeah they crept out<br/>
Ooh you know we need ya<br/>
Ooh I'm glad they freed ya<br/>
Here is where we need ya<br/>
Hey it's nice to see ya<br/>
Welcome back welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac<br/>
Welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac<br/>
Welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac<br/>
Welcome back welcome back welcome back<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to welcome everybody out<br/>
To Fahrenheit 1/15<br/>
First off<br/>
RIP to my nigga Kato<br/>
What up Val<br/>
Magic what up<br/>
My man K'naan<br/>
You know<br/>
The whole henchman crew holding us down<br/>
My man Jigga<br/>
The whole Chi-Town Mike Love what up<br/>
And now<br/>
Y'all about to see something<br/>
That y'all ain't never seen before<br/>
Well<br/>
I don't wanna say never seen<br/>
But not like this you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
FNF up!
