Today, nobody cares <br/>
But tomorrow they will, they will <br/>
Today, nobody cares <br/>
But, oh, tomorrow they will, they will <br/>
<br/>
They said my future was dark <br/>
You see me now? <br/>
Just look around <br/>
I'm beamin' <br/>
<br/>
(We are) They used to talk <br/>
When I wasn't around (Lasers) <br/>
You see me now (We're not) <br/>
(Losers) I'm beamin' <br/>
<br/>
I get my energy from my inner G <br/>
I be in outer space, but I got inner peace <br/>
So tell my enemies that they can't injure me <br/>
I know that irritates, you have my sympathies <br/>
Well, you should protest, yeah, you should picket me <br/>
I'm on a losing strike, I'm on a winning streak <br/>
I'm out in left field, I'm speaking mentally <br/>
But that's a better places than where the benches be <br/>
I'm feelin' really good, me and different beat <br/>
Me and my different drummer, he play the timpanis <br/>
See, that's what got me here, you hearin' me <br/>
Me on my black man in the future shit, call me Billy Dee <br/>
See, I'm just forward-looking, that's how I really see <br/>
See, while you Valentimes, I'm thinking Christmas trees <br/>
And that's how this would be, even at Mickey D's <br/>
Semicolon, close parentheses <br/>
<br/>
They said my future was dark <br/>
You see me now? <br/>
Just look around <br/>
I'm beamin' <br/>
<br/>
They used to talk <br/>
When I wasn't around <br/>
You see me now <br/>
I'm beamin' <br/>
<br/>
Do you remember me, the guy from verse one? <br/>
Failure's my last name, Never's my first one <br/>
You see I hood a lot, and yeah I nerd some <br/>
Hood's where the heart is, nerd's where the words from <br/>
Don't represent either, because I merged them <br/>
'S kids who wanna leave, and I encourage them <br/>
Go out and see the world, never return from <br/>
Yeah, you don't come back, unless you learn some <br/>
And baby girl, what does it matter where your purse from? <br/>
Your hurr done, your nails did, your ass fat, but you're dumb <br/>
Mix Melyssa Ford with Maya Angelou <br/>
Become a top model and Sojourner too <br/>
I try to follow this, what Muhammad do <br/>
It's such a old soul inside the sonic youth <br/>
Swear I'm Ferrari'd up, and I'm conscious, too <br/>
I don't prophesize... I promise you <br/>
<br/>
They said my future was dark <br/>
You see me now? <br/>
Just look around <br/>
I'm beamin' <br/>
<br/>
They used to talk <br/>
When I wasn't around (Lasers) <br/>
You see me now (Ha) <br/>
I'm beamin' <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's me again, the guy from verse two <br/>
Well, this the last one, it's almost curfew <br/>
It's almost night out, so turn your lights on <br/>
Where all my 760s, witcha brights on? <br/>
Yeah, they are the ones to keep your eyes on <br/>
Like how we used to do, to keep the house warm <br/>
Now those the type of eyes, I not cry from <br/>
You see the tears of fire run out my cryin' songs <br/>
Now the world's shoulders is what we cryin' on <br/>
The world's fast lane is what I'm drivin' on <br/>
What am I driving at? I'm tryna drive it home <br/>
I'm in the driver's seat, but you can ride along <br/>
'Cause never cyclops, it's never I alone <br/>
I'm tellin' your story wherever I perform <br/>
Now if they lookin' for me, tell 'em I've gone <br/>
Out in the bright lights, right where I belong <br/>
<br/>
They said my future was dark <br/>
You see me now? <br/>
Just look around <br/>
I'm beamin' <br/>
<br/>
They used to talk <br/>
When I wasn't around <br/>
You see me now <br/>
I'm beamin'
