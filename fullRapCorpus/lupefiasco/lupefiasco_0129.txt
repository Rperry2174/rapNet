You're so smart<br/>
You're like, a contemporary museum of art<br/>
That farts, that's harsh<br/>
Narcissism, on narcotics<br/>
On sharp objects in large pockets<br/>
At dark, you ain't gotta hide it<br/>
Keep it, metal gear solid<br/>
Lead the leaders, that's how you file it<br/>
Then clobber it<br/>
Low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it<br/>
Yeah, it's food in them drums and boxes<br/>
If you beat 'em up then they'll drop it<br/>
And they'll rapidly flicker till they disappear<br/>
Blinking gradually quickens till they isn't here<br/>
And that's da da da da da da da...<br/>
Just to be back in<br/>
Reincarnated, exact twin<br/>
Exact ten, exact twelve<br/>
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...<br/>
Exact self<br/>
Do I really gotta say it?<br/>
Didn't we all play it?<br/>
Dojo, Abobo<br/>
Overshore the throat, polo<br/>
Billy, Jimmy<br/>
Even on the low low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Why you ready to die? You just a baby<br/>
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby<br/>
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby<br/>
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby<br/>
(These Maji adore you) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby<br/>
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby<br/>
<br/>
Now let's vogue, Martin pose<br/>
Downward facing dog, warrior pose<br/>
Tree pose, bridge pose<br/>
Triangle pose, seated twist (pose, pose)<br/>
Upward facing dog (pose, pose)<br/>
Pigeon pose<br/>
In this bitch, that's vulgar, that's yoga<br/>
Let's try it again with clothes<br/>
And closer, enclosure, exposures<br/>
Quiet is kept like Rosicrucian meet koza nostras on Oprah's sofa<br/>
With both controllers<br/>
Watchin' Gazans and ashkenazis ride roller coasters<br/>
Say yeah<br/>
Yeah, lots of options, now up is down, two player<br/>
Now A is jump and B is punch<br/>
You seein' somethin' that weren't there<br/>
To find friendliness in a nemesis, it's a old test<br/>
3 buttons, see somethin'<br/>
That's emphasis on genesis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Can't be eyes closed when you side scroll<br/>
You not the first person<br/>
The first person from your first cursin'<br/>
To your first cursive<br/>
And your curse words is in the curve version<br/>
It occurs virgin is the word version<br/>
That refers perfect to the first person<br/>
In the third verse, who's really me<br/>
In the third person but prefers the first one, that's me<br/>
Again<br/>
Master cleanse and a syringe<br/>
From a gerber until your first burger<br/>
Pamper to her depends<br/>
Everything between is just drawers<br/>
Even in between is no loss<br/>
Even where the king is no boss<br/>
Meet it with a swing it's so south<br/>
Unless you Bamm Bamm<br/>
Knocking them pitches into the grand stands<br/>
In the club, watching the women just do them hand stands<br/>
Like you a man's man<br/>
That's washing down a ham with the Zam Zam<br/>
Who got a baby in here with these strippers?<br/>
She's two weeks pregnant<br/>
Didn't even know, he's dancing with her, damn...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
