<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This world ends, this world ends<br/>
This world ends, this world ends<br/>
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, she love her people so much<br/>
Came to my show just to throw her flag up and<br/>
Pray to God that I saw her<br/>
Wonder if she saw my scarf for Palestine all on it<br/>
Never struggle, Valentine all on it<br/>
Put my heart to it<br/>
Like Noah's Ark I'm too into it<br/>
Like justice I'm just too influenced not to do this to it<br/>
This one dedicated to the soldiers<br/>
Throw up peace signs in the face of bulldozers<br/>
Never bow down or wrap their body in explosives<br/>
As long as your alive, fight your whole lifetime<br/>
The Horn of Africa needs you<br/>
Callin' out to all you friends of the people<br/>
Be the change that you wanna see<br/>
Tell 'em no change just ain't what it gonna be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, the people, united, will never be defeated<br/>
And all my people's smite just forever be repeated<br/>
These streets our streets, it'll never be deleted<br/>
No matter how many cops that you send to try and beat it<br/>
This is revolution in the making<br/>
A ragtag movement set to takeover the nation<br/>
Now isn't that fun?<br/>
You just wanna make the world better, isn't that young?<br/>
Well, blessings to the youth then<br/>
And don't stop, until they let the truth in<br/>
Once there, never let it leave<br/>
And protect it, they'll catch it and never set it free<br/>
And every set is free<br/>
Blood sweat and tears, no place I'd rather be<br/>
So, let's occupy Wall Street, all day, all week<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So again, I fight evil<br/>
This what I gotta do to live my life peaceful?<br/>
So be it, outspoken and low key it<br/>
My heart big, limousine no Fiat<br/>
And you can hear it loud every time God beat it<br/>
Love always shines every time I see it<br/>
Exactly what they hated is exactly what I needed<br/>
And exactly where I started is exactly where I leave it<br/>
Cause I ain't never ever ever change<br/>
I say that because I ain't never felt better mane<br/>
Beautiful LASERS as fans, do me a favor, this time I'll repay ya<br/>
Friend of the peeps, free Chill, ask her what's peace<br/>
Holla at me if you see me in the streets<br/>
A picture costs a dollar, First and Fifteenth<br/>
<br/>
