<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Gold medals, them my role models<br/>
Rollin' old models, lowered old schools<br/>
Flowin' cold and goin' gold follows<br/>
Flower bearin', call it petals to the floor<br/>
Power sharin', call it devils to the door<br/>
Power, power, 'til ain't no devils anymore<br/>
Flower, flowers, they be droppin' at the feet of my sun<br/>
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum<br/>
And who do I meet, to the beat of my drum<br/>
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer<br/>
All bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas<br/>
Had a long money, minor do that action for them figures<br/>
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah<br/>
Walked up to my ride, asked me could she get inside<br/>
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied<br/>
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition<br/>
And with me up on them beats, then we shared the same description<br/>
With a blunt between her lips, she said, "Now here's my proposition:<br/>
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em<br/>
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em<br/>
Then we take 'em to the record store and sell a couple million"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gizzle:]</i><br/>
I already got the money, already got the bitches<br/>
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it<br/>
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper<br/>
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Tell me call up Soundtrakk, have him send a couple beats<br/>
Not that "Superstar" shit, she wanted somethin' for the streets<br/>
Said it might take like a month, she said it better take a week<br/>
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat<br/>
Said, "I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice<br/>
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write<br/>
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like"<br/>
She said, "My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life"<br/>
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow, yeah them niggas started bussin'<br/>
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it<br/>
She said, "Nigga hit the gas," went from zero to a hunnid<br/>
Now we runnin' from some killers, I was so sick to my stomach<br/>
She was hangin' out the window with that thumper she was dumpin'<br/>
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'<br/>
We was swervin', jumped the curb<br/>
And ditched the whip and started runnin'<br/>
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall<br/>
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked<br/>
I was shook and breathin' hard<br/>
And she was sittin' there smokin' kush<br/>
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like "What is this?"<br/>
And then we looked up and a light came down<br/>
And pulled us to a ship, like, "What the fuck?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gizzle:]</i><br/>
I already got the money, already got the bitches<br/>
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it<br/>
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper<br/>
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen<br/>
<br/>
Well now this the shit I'm talkin' 'bout, the shit that I've been on<br/>
Yeah lightyears outer space, but still a bitch feel right at home<br/>
Now where the bitches?<br/>
Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'<br/>
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper<br/>
Now I could never go back to trappin'<br/>
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lapdance<br/>
With a lit match in your left hand, and your right hand is a gas can<br/>
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up<br/>
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up<br/>
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work<br/>
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush<br/>
Nah, nigga, nah nigga<br/>
I ain't in no rush<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Ayy I thought you couldn't rap, when'd you learn how to do that?<br/>
Then what you need me for if you already know how to flow?<br/>
Ayy fuck that, we gotta go, wouldn't even be in this ho<br/>
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO<br/>
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it<br/>
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin' saucer pilot<br/>
But first thing's gon' be first, when we get back to that earth<br/>
I'ma go back to them raps and you can go back to that work, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gizzle &amp; Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
I already got the money, already got the bitches<br/>
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it<br/>
Nigga we're goin' home, home!<br/>
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper<br/>
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen<br/>
You can kill me, I don't care, no!<br/>
<br/>
Ayy look, the basic thing is, you can do whatever you wanna do.<br/>
Like I ain't 'bout to pass up on all this shit, you see this? Like we time jumpin' and shit.<br/>
You wanna go back and do what, just rap? You can rap up here!<br/>
Yeah nigga, just rap. No you can't, nigga, this is space. You can't, fuck that, we goin' home. DROGAS!
