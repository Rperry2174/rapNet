Too many best rappers, not enough best rhymes tho<br/>
Guess I'm delusional, used to doing it all the time so<br/>
Maybe I'm just jaded, out of touch and unrelated<br/>
Unable to connect greatness based on the person who makes it<br/>
Or maybe I just hate it<br/>
And that would make me hater<br/>
Maybe it is great but that don't mean it's greater<br/>
Having your profile raised doesn't make you a raiser<br/>
Being ambiguous with assertions, isn't making you safer<br/>
What you mean tho?<br/>
Line us up, paddling us on the back<br/>
Like we steamboat you, president of the frat<br/>
You goin' sling toast, like you Ringo<br/>
And you think Doc Holliday's<br/>
Just goin' tolerate and too sick to let that thing go<br/>
It's just a matter of returns<br/>
Ashes to ashes, scattered them from the urns<br/>
To start a fire shaky to gather them from the burned<br/>
And reassemble these ashes, the blackness is something firm<br/>
Then moving blackness backwards in the bread of some other shit<br/>
Any deep we spreadin' wheat seeds from a bucket shit<br/>
McDonald had a farm and he lovin' it<br/>
Rolls Royce of the scented voice against the arms of the government<br/>
Artist gettin' robbed for their publishing<br/>
By dirty Jewish execs that think his alms from the covenant<br/>
I'll retire when I'm tired, that's a Firestone death<br/>
Easy to say when nobody's there, like a microphone check<br/>
They wanna hear what I'm gon' say before the microphone check<br/>
Make me sign an NDA before the microphone test<br/>
Let you face that type of faith, institutional opposition<br/>
Then with all due respect, you are not my competition<br/>
Nah
