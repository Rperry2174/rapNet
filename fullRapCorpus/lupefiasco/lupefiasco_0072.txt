Uh, we just going to keep it going and going<br/>
until I feel completed and happy about it. You know?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Opus of a ghetto boy who grew into a project man<br/>
Brewster Place (booster plates), he used to stick his scissors in his sockets damn<br/>
clear that Project Runway, 'cause this is where my rocket lands<br/>
ain't got no problems, Houston, I A.K.A. then rocket land<br/>
Events recent that lit a fire under him like pots and pans<br/>
rockets and I (eye) up in the sky like helicopter cams<br/>
And you down there in the traffic jam<br/>
from here I've seen a bunch of fake shit like avid wrestling fans<br/>
Came up from the bottom of the eye exam, zoom<br/>
Now I'm like the biggest G off in the room<br/>
still hard to see me like the truth on TV<br/>
or the roof from the sidewalk, I don't flow (floor), I ceiling<br/>
My mama said they need me<br/>
'cause, I'm made from the best stuff on earth like Snapple Tea Leaves<br/>
they glass is half full so I spit into them like Celie<br/>
no longer G, now you can see me<br/>
but your letters' (lettuce) still under my sea (C) like seaweed<br/>
C and G but nothing bout me CG<br/>
It's all real, none of this is green screen<br/>
(Shut Up and Let Me Go) just like The Ting Tings<br/>
I'm feeling like a Mac, standing around a bunch of PCs<br/>
I've rocked it from the shouters to the soccer moms<br/>
try to stop what's going on<br/>
you'll see the back of my hand like the tops of palms<br/>
I'm balling like the tops of pawns<br/>
circle of influence getting bigger like the ripples on the tops of ponds<br/>
Short-footed and War Headed like the tops of bombs<br/>
Dominoing niggas, delivery is Papa John's, Little Ceaser's, uh<br/>
burning down your Pizza Huts<br/>
Plaque collection building 'cause, I don't brush my teeth enough<br/>
yeah, Crack is wack and reefer sucks, you might think this deep as fuck<br/>
but this like my weaker stuff<br/>
they ask "Is this his day-to-day 'cause this is like a week to us?"<br/>
Mic is shy and speakers blush, I is shy (Chi) and he is up<br/>
I correct, me is up - no we is up - cause its like two of me<br/>
and each of us, rapping acid, eat this up<br/>
A-Town down, peace is up, New York to East Coast is tough<br/>
West Side riding, lot of niggas salty 'cause<br/>
'cause I be overseas and (over seasoned) tough.<br/>
Everything seamless, WorldStar never seen this<br/>
NahRight gotta stream this, motherfucking genius<br/>
Brave and fly, you backboneless and wingless<br/>
bunch of chickens on the strip, I'm coming for they fingers<br/>
till what they throwing up is meaningless<br/>
Chilly Chill you seeing this? This didn't make MTV's list<br/>
Finish fingers, eating wrist, feeding frenzy and shit<br/>
Succotash suffering, Chicken Fricassee-en this<br/>
a beat eating media blitz<br/>
pace is getting feverish, pain is growing severe-ish<br/>
these the peppers Peter picked<br/>
things are at their easiest, Real Compton city G'in it<br/>
but I'm from Chicago, house lights, bravos<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm just playing....Internet, check!
