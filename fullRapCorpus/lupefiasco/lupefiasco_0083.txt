<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
This one goes out to the baby girls<br/>
In a rush growing up in this crazy world<br/>
Yeah your brother on the road and he never home<br/>
I know you feeling kinda sad now that daddy gone<br/>
You can't let it get you down, gotta carry on<br/>
We only lose things because it make us strong<br/>
You always had my love, and now you got a song<br/>
From the biggest biggest fan that you've ever known<br/>
I know you won't be little girls, not for very long<br/>
And you ain't gotta have a man if you don't ever want<br/>
Cause I'm gonna make sure you got two of everything<br/>
That you ever want, every time, like your very own<br/>
Not to make you hard to respect<br/>
Just really really really really hard to impress<br/>
It's a whole wide world for you to go and get your hands on<br/>
Until then, just come and get your dance on now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I see you coming up<br/>
I'mma give you the lowdown<br/>
You will never gotta worry about nothin<br/>
Just as long as I'm around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This for everybody feeling good<br/>
You know who you are, or you misunderstood<br/>
Never had money, or you living good<br/>
If you from the burbs, if you in the hood<br/>
Recognize where we come from<br/>
In my day, mane, I did a little somethin some-<br/>
They like "how come you don't rap that?"<br/>
Cause that's a backtrack and I ain't tryna back back<br/>
I'm only moving forward homie that's that<br/>
Direction, a lot of shoulders lack that<br/>
I'm just trying give it to 'em like sat-nav<br/>
Now I know I'm gonna make out like a fat rat<br/>
That's cool as long as they don't trap crack<br/>
Graduate from school, and still let his pants sag<br/>
Never catch a case, know how to let his cash stack<br/>
Welcome to the (map go anyway tap that back?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I see you coming up<br/>
I'mma give you the lowdown, down, down (alright, alright)<br/>
You ain't never gotta worry about nothing (you ain't gotta worry)<br/>
Just as long as I'm around, (as long as I'm here) round, round, round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
And if the floor falls out<br/>
I'mma be there to carry you<br/>
And if you want that star<br/>
I'll go get it out the sky for you<br/>
If you gotta shed a tear<br/>
I'mma dry your eyes<br/>
Just to let you know it'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I know it's like a whole lot going on<br/>
Things going right, things going wrong<br/>
Maybe baby, I've been waiting for you so long<br/>
Know that in this world you're never really on your own<br/>
God got a number get him on the phone<br/>
He'll never put you places where you don't belong<br/>
Put you through the pain, to put you on the throne<br/>
And I know that from the bottom of my corazon<br/>
And if they looking at you sideways<br/>
You just wave right back, tell 'em hi hater<br/>
Mad you ain't hanging with 'em in the driveway<br/>
Nah we going to keep it moving to the highway<br/>
(Strong's putting on?) week's all over like Friday, chilling<br/>
Shout out to King David for bringing in philly<br/>
And I'mma put the independent women in the building, let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I see you coming up (I see you coming up)<br/>
I'mma give you the lowdown (down), down (down), down (all the way down)<br/>
You ain't never gotta worry about nothing<br/>
Just as long as I'm around (I'm around), round, (yeah) round (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I see you coming up (I see you coming up, I see you coming up)<br/>
I'mma give you the lowdown (down), down (down), down (all the way down)<br/>
You ain't never gotta worry about nothing (don't worry about a thing)<br/>
Just as long as I'm around (I'm around), round, (yeah) round (yeah) round
