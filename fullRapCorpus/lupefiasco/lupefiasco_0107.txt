<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I say bitch bad, woman good, lady better<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Now imagine there's a shawty, maybe five maybe four<br/>
Ridin' 'round with his mama listening to the radio<br/>
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born<br/>
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong<br/>
Now I ain't trying to make it too complex<br/>
But let's just say shawty has an undeveloped context<br/>
About the perception of women these days<br/>
His mama sings along and this what she says<br/>
"Niggas I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad bitch<br/>
Far above average"<br/>
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage<br/>
And baby carriage and other things that match it<br/>
Couple of things that are happenin' here<br/>
First he's relatin' the word "bitch" with his mama, comma<br/>
And because she's relatin' to herself, his most important source of help,<br/>
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bitch bad, woman good<br/>
Lady better, they misunderstood<br/>
(I'm killin' these bitches)<br/>
Uh, tell 'em<br/>
Bitch bad, woman good<br/>
Lady better, they misunderstood<br/>
They misunderstood<br/>
(I'm killin' these bitches)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve<br/>
On the internet watchin' videos listenin' to songs by themselves<br/>
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance<br/>
They understand the internet better than their parents<br/>
Now being the interent, the content's probably uncensored<br/>
They're young, so they're maleable and probably unmentored<br/>
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance<br/>
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference<br/>
"Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches<br/>
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches"<br/>
Now let's say that they less concerned with him<br/>
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims<br/>
Ah, the plot thickens<br/>
High heels, long hair, fat booty, slim<br/>
Reality check, I'm not trippin'<br/>
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Disclaimer: This rhymer, Lupe's not usin' bitch as a lesson<br/>
But as a psychological weapon<br/>
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions<br/>
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection<br/>
Cause, while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast<br/>
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp<br/>
Sure enough, in this little world<br/>
The little boy meets one of those little girls<br/>
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch<br/>
He thinks this respectfully, she thinks of that sexually<br/>
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her<br/>
He thinks she's bad at being a bitch like his mother<br/>
Momma never dress like that, come out the house, hot mess like that<br/>
Ass, titties, dress like that<br/>
All out to impress like that<br/>
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion<br/>
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion<br/>
Bad mean good to her, she really nice and smart<br/>
But bad mean bad to him, bitch don't play your part<br/>
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way<br/>
But she think she a bitch, what a double entendre<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Bitch bad, woman good<br/>
Lady better, they misunderstood<br/>
You're misunderstood<br/>
Bitch bad, woman good<br/>
Lady better, greatest motherhood<br/>
(I'm killin' these bitches)
