She said that there was no love in her heart<br/>
Cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke<br/>
That all apart<br/>
She said there was no way to fix it<br/>
Or to cover her scars<br/>
Then one day a guy came along that<br/>
Probably could help her start<br/>
He was sincere made her believe it was safe<br/>
For her to trust again<br/>
Before long she was cool to giving hugs to him<br/>
Knew that it was right cause somethin was wrong<br/>
The alarms in her mind didn't tell her he didn't belong<br/>
<br/>
There was no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Intruder <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Alert <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
He said nobody else ever loved em (him)<br/>
Thats why he get high enough to go touch the heavens above em<br/>
Vividly remembers every pipe<br/>
Every needle that stuck em<br/>
Every alley he ever slept in<br/>
Every purse that he snuck in<br/>
Every level of hell he's been to<br/>
And the one that he's stuck in<br/>
The one he cant escape<br/>
Even tho it's of his own construction<br/>
Maybe you can relate<br/>
Maybe you one of those that just doesn't<br/>
Maybe he doesn't care<br/>
Loves to allow these demons to come in<br/>
With no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Intruder <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Alert <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Famine stricken his home<br/>
Land and no social standing<br/>
In the economic pecking order<br/>
Emergency relief<br/>
Distribution systems is in disorder<br/>
He's checking water making sure<br/>
It's safe enough for his<br/>
Daughter to float across in<br/>
The boat he built<br/>
Hopefully strong enough to support<br/>
Praying border patrols<br/>
Don't catch her<br/>
And process and deport her<br/>
Before she reach the shore<br/>
Of the land of the free<br/>
Where they feed u<br/>
Treat u like equals<br/>
Deceive you<br/>
Stamp u<br/>
And call you illegal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Intruder <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Alert <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Singin'<br/>
<br/>
There's someone here<br/>
And it's not me<br/>
How could this be<br/>
I locked my doors<br/>
Kept my armies on my shore<br/>
Point my rockets at my skies<br/>
<br/>
I'm so fortified<br/>
I built my wall so high<br/>
SO WHY OH'<br/>
YYYYYYYYYYYYYY<br/>
<br/>
Intruder <i>[repeat]</i>
