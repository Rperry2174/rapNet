<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[yaawn]</i> - Thanks,<br/>
Feels good wakin' up,<br/>
Get back... on my J.O.<br/>
ooohh,<br/>
And you will be going, cause I gotta go to work<br/>
It's coo...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I wipe the cold from my eye<br/>
Stationed in Antarctica, coldest nigga alive<br/>
Flow is Armageddon might smite crows from the Sky<br/>
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides<br/>
But I'm warming up, oceans is on the rise<br/>
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side<br/>
Colder than Chris Martin guitarin' - would you look at all these Spies?<br/>
But they can't see me, I took out their eyes<br/>
Replaced them with some me's, so all they see is he's<br/>
But I will never run, not even if they cry<br/>
See I can never fall, not even down their cheek<br/>
But I will always ball, let's see who the first to blink<br/>
And I don't need no passwords cause I don't need to cheat<br/>
But you can say your last words then you can rest in peace<br/>
I'm the hook after your last verse, I'm also like the beat<br/>
But I will turn it down so you can go to sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You can go to sleep<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep<br/>
Said you can go to sleep <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Good night, good night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
(Real niggas up again)<br/>
(Phony niggas tuckin' in)<br/>
Now you can go to sleep<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep<br/>
Now you can go to sleep <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Good night, good night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball<br/>
Real niggas poppin off, phony niggas not at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Insomniac since way back, see that's what I been like<br/>
Bacon, eggs and pancakes, eating that at midnight<br/>
Getting up and going hard, I don't need no Enzyte<br/>
Come across as very calm, mental state is Zen like<br/>
Always had a lot of heart, never been the tin type<br/>
Never will I drop a dime, never been the ten type<br/>
My girlfriend is very fine, yeah she is a ten, right?<br/>
Mink is dragon on the floor, fire in my windpipe<br/>
You should come and clean up after riots that I incite<br/>
Things got off the handle, left behind a landfill<br/>
Traffic at a standstill, stadium is fan-filled<br/>
Fill this bitch up with fans, you still won't blow my candle...out<br/>
My can do spirit's in the house, and it's possessing your possessions,<br/>
did you hear it by the couch?<br/>
Boogeyman under here but not in your closet, cause I'm not a...<br/>
Won't drill no door hole, I won't make a peep, so...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You can go to sleep<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep<br/>
Now you can go to sleep<br/>
Said you can go to sleep<br/>
Good night, good night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
(Real niggas up again)<br/>
(Phony niggas tuckin' in)<br/>
Now you can go to sleep<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep<br/>
Now you can go to sleep <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Good night, good night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball<br/>
Real niggas poppin off, phony niggas not at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I wipe the cold from my eye, then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise<br/>
And that my clothes dry, but I am so high, I'm sitting on the storm that I got soaked by<br/>
Now you can come close so, you can get warm<br/>
But you get no pie, but you can sell 'em for him so, here's your bow tie<br/>
Now get ready to fall, 'cause humans don't fly, the boy in the balloon<br/>
See I didn't go high, and then I'm coming back to flow again<br/>
Closed out all that opium, but I had to O-P-EN<br/>
They said they need a hero-in it, so I'm back to dope again<br/>
Pull up in that old school Flintstone drop on rolling pins<br/>
Time is all behind me, this make me feel old again<br/>
Grandma's all around me, I can feel her soul within'<br/>
Hold my daddy over him<br/>
I woke the rooster's, woke the hen's<br/>
Everything's cashmere, count the sheep that make 'em..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(You can) go to sleep<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep<br/>
Now you can go to sleep<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep<br/>
(Go to sleep, it's okay!)<br/>
Good night, good night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
(Real niggas up again)<br/>
(Phony niggas tuckin' in)<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Now you can go to sleep<br/>
Yes you can go to sleep<br/>
Good night, good night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball<br/>
Real niggas poppin off, phony niggas not at all<br/>
<i>[Fades]</i>
