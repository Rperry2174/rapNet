<i>[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Lord have Murcielagos waiting on the nigga<br/>
At the end when the time come<br/>
Get the drop on the weed spot<br/>
Like there's too much water in the tea pot, huh<br/>
Lord have Murcielagos on the poor, nigga, pour, nigga<br/>
They adore the event of war<br/>
Down force on the doors of adored niggas<br/>
Does the Lord like to thank award winners?<br/>
And the war winners'll rewards inner<br/>
Or the all-enders ain't the pure chemists<br/>
So the form in this can be raw in this like the porn business<br/>
Keen to king 'til the, 'til the pawn hit us<br/>
If he goes, half a million sold, sold the soul, going gold<br/>
In the end will it go to the pawn business?<br/>
You ain't doing nothing with it<br/>
Let a nigga get it for the low-low-low-low<br/>
Lames tried to form it, brains couldn't storm it like a Ororo-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro<br/>
In the Philippines eating chicken wings, smothered with adobo-dobo-dobo-do<br/>
Vatos, fiascos, vocos locos like a cho-lo-lo-lo<br/>
Gadget go, go, go, go, go<br/>
Ratchet ho, ho, ho, ho, ho<br/>
Santa ho, ho, ho, ho, ho<br/>
K-Ci, Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo<br/>
Brown skin brother in a fed box at the hell lil' nigga live there for months<br/>
Except these young, black males wouldn't drive if you give them trucks<br/>
Nigga, nigga, nigga what<br/>
I don't give a, give a, give a, fuck<br/>
With a, with a, with a mind full of money, pockets full of nothing<br/>
Niggas gonna feel what a nigga feel<br/>
Always been a winner ever since beginner<br/>
All the way to the end and never ever been a pussy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x4 - Billy Blue:]</i><br/>
Pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga, pussy pussy nigga get fucked<br/>
Real nigga, Twitter, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Lord, please keep these diablo niggas off a nigga mind<br/>
Lord, please keep these diablo niggas off a nigga spine<br/>
Lord, please keep me Fiasco outta rest of these nigga lie<br/>
These nigga lie, these nigga lie, these nigga lie, these nigga lie<br/>
Lord, please forgive me for the sinning<br/>
Sinning please forgive me for the snitching to the Lord<br/>
Openin' for businesses to the ribbon niggas wanting to get in, open up the doors<br/>
Son wanna feel 'em, open up the ceiling<br/>
Niggas start tripping, open up the floor<br/>
Trap like Indiana Jones looking for a map<br/>
That I sketched on the back on one of my raps under my hat<br/>
Coffin is the cousin to the bed that's under my back<br/>
Dream so real niggas die taking one of my naps<br/>
Mattress full of money, monster under that sheets full of raps<br/>
Comfort for the weak, sleep for the whack<br/>
Party while you slumber, tell 'em money coming, jump in my sack<br/>
Niggas wanna exercise, exercise I-X-I ain't no jumpin' my jack<br/>
If I lift an arm I'mma lift a car, nigga, that's a gun in my lap<br/>
Hurdle to the tire, chariots of fire<br/>
I'm a flyer, take you under my flap<br/>
Is he going nuts? Is he going bolts?<br/>
No, going both running my track<br/>
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga what<br/>
I just figure, figure, figure you gon' be a nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga what<br/>
And since niggas is faster than them white folks on the tracks<br/>
White folks tightrope, like both, I could be a sprintin' nigga<br/>
Nik Wallenda, runnin' over rap<br/>
I higher, higher wire, you a wire on a power pad running over that<br/>
Running over that, running over that, running over that, running over that<br/>
Five time winner, five-nine, fine line thinner<br/>
Einstein mind, mind bender<br/>
Fine dine, nine, wine, find cocaine in my mind's antenna<br/>
Pussy!<br/>
<br/>
