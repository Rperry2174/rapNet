<i>[SimonSayz:]</i><br/>
I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br/>
I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna be here by myself<br/>
But I'm just like you, and you don't wanna be by yourself<br/>
Wanna put my name on it, but don't wanna end the friendship<br/>
Cause that's a declaration, of independence<br/>
Would you lie for it? Would you die for it?<br/>
Put fireworks all inside of that sky for it<br/>
Would you wait for me, then get away from me<br/>
Wait 'til I come outside, hop inside the ride and floor it<br/>
Tell her, she'll be safe with me<br/>
To the tellers in the safe with me<br/>
When the shooting starts, don't go with them<br/>
You should stay with me<br/>
Cause in the race of hearts, that's the place to be<br/>
Cause the finish line is exactly where you start<br/>
So I'll run around this whole bitch, just to end up where you are<br/>
Now that's real shit, treadmill shit<br/>
I'm Treadstone but I feel shit<br/>
That's Bourne knowledge, yes you are, you just gonna have to believe<br/>
That we 'bout to go to work so these niggas gonna have to leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SimonSayz:]</i><br/>
I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br/>
I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Now you all business, started up yourself small business<br/>
And we all in this, no half-stepping, we high heel<br/>
All inches, high yield, small interest, hell yeah<br/>
That's a loan and we owe some<br/>
But we pay the bank out the same sack we just stole from<br/>
That's real, that's steal<br/>
Like four to two, I look forward to you, lookin down on the field<br/>
And you look 4'2", look forward boo, don't look down at your heels<br/>
Don't matter what's at stake, just let it burn, don't e'en look down at your grill<br/>
Either way we gon' ball, look around at your wheels<br/>
Even the baby gon' ball, look around at your wheels<br/>
This ain't my shit, this our shit<br/>
Look around what you build and that's great and shape<br/>
And you should look inside how you feel<br/>
You look and sound like you trill, you look inside for that feel<br/>
Or just look inside how I look inside you, I look inside like I kill<br/>
And you just gon' have to be<br/>
And babe I'm 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave<br/>
<br/>

I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br/>
I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
She don't want no soft nigga, she just don't want no false nigga<br/>
Daddy can be a gangsta, just can't be no lost nigga<br/>
If you a senior, be a senior<br/>
Don't be runnin' around like some frosh niggas<br/>
Snapback is great, but you about to graduate<br/>
Take your hat off nigga<br/>
Tiger did cause tiger could<br/>
But if Tiger couldn't then Tiger wouldn't<br/>
That's a billion dollars off golf nigga<br/>
See my fast money and my cash money take a lost with her<br/>
And let's move slow and make a million dollars off cough syrup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SimonSayz:]</i><br/>
I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?<br/>
I just wanna be here alone, alone<br/>
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you<br/>
Tell me, how do you feel?
