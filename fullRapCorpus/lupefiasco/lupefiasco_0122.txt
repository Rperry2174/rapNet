King... We are kings of African music, we are kings. Because music...is the king of all professions<br/>
<br/>
N.U. music<br/>
<br/>
Mislaid plan make a mess made<br/>
Damnation, let's play hands and spades<br/>
That's without, a boycott and a sit-out<br/>
Afro-Black pick in with a fist out<br/>
From the "welcome home" to the kick out<br/>
Reach into a rabbit, pull a trick out<br/>
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out<br/>
Hard times call for armed time<br/>
Sick, sick, sick eyes from the nose pressure<br/>
Police snip, zip ties on the protesters<br/>
Six wives in the fry of a molester<br/>
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa<br/>
Dirty needles breaking all the old records<br/>
A hundred hoes, one shovel and some old treasure<br/>
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester<br/>
Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers<br/>
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather<br/>
New sale, two L's and some old letters<br/>
Now he doing double life, while she lead a double life<br/>
Man, he need another wife<br/>
New approach might help a nigga bowl better<br/>
New hoes might help a nigga hold together<br/>
Or will the new lane lead em' to the same pen<br/>
And the hunger strike in em' to the same tin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Love is looking over various errors<br/>
And hate is habitually accelerating terror<br/>
Everywhere but the mural<br/>
I just wanna be collected when I call God damn<br/>
I don't wanna be accepted; not as all as I am<br/>
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land<br/>
<br/>
Getting slammed from the protest, no food<br/>
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube<br/>
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes<br/>
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school<br/>
I need more for the Michaels<br/>
That's a loss for the class, and a score for the rifles<br/>
Three hots and a cot, and some cops<br/>
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible<br/>
It's all quiet in the jail-house<br/>
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out<br/>
They was looking for the swords, they was looking for the swords<br/>
I'm just looking at they feet, cause I'm looking for the lord<br/>
Looking in the library, looking at the law<br/>
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar<br/>
Claim sovereignty, because I'm bunkin' with the moors<br/>
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game<br/>
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books<br/>
Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank<br/>
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard<br/>
AB got the kitchen, snitches on PC<br/>
MM on a mission, but CO's got the prison<br/>
God got us all, God set us free<br/>
God is the key, but the guards got the doors<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Punching on the glass<br/>
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass<br/>
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gonna take away the visits<br/>
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it<br/>
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string<br/>
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT Team<br/>
That's a cop team, they sent hella cops, to stop, the helicoptering<br/>
Man, he thought that he'd fly away, like a kite, take flight<br/>
Like a letter on a string, like propellers on a wing<br/>
But the kite was the key<br/>
They made electric chairs for his dying days<br/>
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay<br/>
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac<br/>
Maybe he could dig a tunnel out of A Block<br/>
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top<br/>
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box<br/>
Looking at the world through the TV<br/>
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops<br/>
Ay! That's how it is in a police state<br/>
When your life is just a number and release date<br/>
When you're rehabilitated so correctly<br/>
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free<br/>

<i>[Ayesha Jaco:]</i><br/>
The orange wings of the new Jim Crow are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers, Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck as the new Jim Crow Corporations feed him seeds, yet unborn<br/>
Heâ€™ll be captured by Mya, in a ruby-encrusted cage<br/>
I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and answers that I leave in empty pages to be written. Where is your pen? The new Jim Crow<br/>
<br/>
They sell they souls<br/>
They sell their selves<br/>
They ain't twelve, they old<br/>
Niggas old as hell<br/>
Old as jail, old as cells<br/>
Sold so much salt, ain't no more salt on the shelves<br/>
You a prisoner too, you living here too<br/>
You just like us, til' your shift get through<br/>
You could look like us, you know shit get through<br/>
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike 2<br/>
You should get like life, you should get like woo!<br/>
You should get that twice! You should get refused<br/>
The open road, that's no parole, and no control<br/>
Over your own soul, so control, your own remote control, that your folks can hold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
You better watch these niggas (un garde)<br/>
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas<br/>
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas and throw away the key,<br/>
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me<br/>
(I'd throw away the keys) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Better watch these niggas (un guarde)<br/>
<br/>
5th year with the DOC<br/>
You can see what's CO see<br/>
Robocop opt his COP<br/>
3 hots and a C-O-T<br/>
Lived in a small town, his whole life<br/>
Never left, soundin' like the hole, right?<br/>
Either working at the prison, or it's no lights<br/>
In the system working with the po-lice<br/>
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights<br/>
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars<br/>
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong<br/>
Watching niggas get home, he jail us<br/>
But deep down he jealous<br/>
With each sweep down, he tell us<br/>
With each beat down, he help us<br/>
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though<br/>
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for<br/>
Warden told the boy he better calm down<br/>
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down<br/>
But how the whole world in your palm sound?<br/>
It's why they treat niggas like shit<br/>
Writing raps to the taps, keep the face mask on 'em these niggas might spit!<br/>
<br/>
