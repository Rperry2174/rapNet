<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Album on hold, whole word on hold<br/>
The crowd is like "ho!", operator's like "hold"<br/>
Man, now ain't that cold?<br/>
I'm just trying to talk to my homie, that's up in the hole<br/>
Homegirl ain't trying to be a hoe, even though she on a pole<br/>
Can she get a second chance? NO!<br/>
Whoa! Like the opposite of gold<br/>
That's how it's supposed to be: a butterfly<br/>
For the sake of rhyming let's just say "butterflyee"<br/>
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali<br/>
I tell 'em tell 'em don't homicide me<br/>
I just a little old hope with his back against the ropes<br/>
Fighting for his fans and, fighting for his folks<br/>
But the boo's from the crowd they become so loud<br/>
If I could block em out then, I could knock em out then<br/>
Dance around the ring, but until then I'll say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me<br/>
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be<br/>
Until I get there<br/>
Until I get there<br/>
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect<br/>
But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it<br/>
When I get there<br/>
When I get there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
"Doctor doctor please! The fame ain't painless enough"<br/>
That's cause you ain't famous enough<br/>
You got a little game, but your name ain't ringing enough<br/>
He said "take 2 of these and put change in my cup"<br/>
I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more<br/>
Prescribed me a publicist and pointed me to the door<br/>
"Out!" Ouch.. I'm telling you this all from a therapist's couch<br/>
"Tell me about your mother? What she's all about?"<br/>
Prescribed me an interview and then told me to bounce<br/>
Damn..geez. The world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis<br/>
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees<br/>
Went unconscious, they rushed me to a concert<br/>
Instead of green jello they made me chicken soup<br/>
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me<br/>
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be<br/>
Until I get there<br/>
Until I get there<br/>
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect<br/>
But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it<br/>
When I get there<br/>
When I get there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
And when I finally make it, I'mma stunt so hard<br/>
Evil as Knievel, I'mma jump so far<br/>
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't coming back<br/>
Be a jerk to these jerks, yeah that'll make em hurt<br/>
Huh? Instead of young boy in the mirror<br/>
A young version of me, so I started to tear up<br/>
He said "you need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up<br/>
You're already here, just be yourself from here up"<br/>
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar<br/>
Something I was taught, something I had lost<br/>
If you are afraid, the fear that you gon' change some<br/>
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me<br/>
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be<br/>
Until I get there<br/>
Until I get there<br/>
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect<br/>
But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it<br/>
When I get there<br/>
When I get there
