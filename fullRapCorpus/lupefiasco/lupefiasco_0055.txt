<i>[Lupe speaking]</i><br/>
Uh this one right here goes out<br/>
To my homie with the dream<br/>
Know what I mean<br/>
<br/>
He said I write what I see<br/>
Write to make it right<br/>
Don't like where I be<br/>
I'd like to make it like<br/>
The sights on TV<br/>
Quite the great life<br/>
So nice and easy<br/>
See now you can still die from that<br/>
But it's better than not being alive from straps<br/>
Agreed<br/>
A mead notebook and a Bic that click<br/>
When it's pushed and a wack beat<br/>
That's a track that's weak<br/>
That he got last week<br/>
'cause everybody in the store<br/>
Was like that's that heat<br/>
A bass heavy medley with a sample from the 70s<br/>
With a screwed up hook that went<br/>
STACK THAT CHEESE<br/>
Something something something<br/>
STACK THAT CHEESE<br/>
Mother sister cousin<br/>
STACK THAT CHEESE<br/>
He couldn't think of nothing<br/>
STACK THAT CHEESE<br/>
He turns down the beat writers block impedes<br/>
Crying from the next room a baby in need<br/>
Of some pampers and some food and a place to sleep<br/>
That plus a black Cadillac on D's<br/>
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Nikki Jean) 2x:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Reps Northside so he rocks them braids<br/>
Eleven hundred friends on his myspace page<br/>
Stack that cheese got seven hundred plays<br/>
Producer made him take it down<br/>
Said he had to pay<br/>
Open mic champ 2 weeks in a row<br/>
Ex boy with a boy flow<br/>
Glow like Leroy you should see boy go<br/>
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on The Row<br/>
Best homie in the grave<br/>
Tattered up while in the cage<br/>
Minutemaid got his momma work like a slave<br/>
Down baby momma who he really had to honor<br/>
'cause she was his biggest fan<br/>
Even let him use the Honda<br/>
Drive up to Dallas went to open up for amateurs<br/>
Let him keep her debit card<br/>
So he could put gas in it<br/>
Told her when he get on<br/>
He's gonna take her to the gallery<br/>
Buy her everything but the mannequins your dig<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Nikki Jean) 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
His man called said "your time might be now"<br/>
They played your freestlye over "Wipe me down"<br/>
They played it two times<br/>
Said it might be crowned<br/>
As the best thing out the H-TOWN in a while<br/>
He picked up his son with a great big smile<br/>
Rapped every single word to the newborn child<br/>
Then he put 'em down and went back to the kitchen<br/>
Put on another beat and got back to the mission<br/>
To get his momma out the hood<br/>
Put her somewhere in the woods<br/>
Keep his lady looking good<br/>
Have her rolling like she should<br/>
Show his homies there's a way<br/>
Other than that flipping Yay<br/>
Bail his homie outta jail<br/>
Put a lawyer on his case<br/>
Throw a concert for the school<br/>
Show this that's it cool<br/>
Throw some candy on the cadi<br/>
Chuck the duece and act a fool<br/>
Man it feels good when it happens like that<br/>
Two days from going back to selling crack, yes sir<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Nikki Jean) 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hip hope has saved my life <i>[4X]</i>
