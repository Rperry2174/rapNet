Wa-ves... you say waves, I say wa-ves<br/>
Kaepernick, waddup?<br/>
I knew they was gonna do that to you<br/>
But it's all good, though<br/>
You gotta' stand up for something, know what I'm talking about?<br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
<br/>
Gravitons, orbit around my halo space, halo space<br/>
Little Debbie crumbs and potato flakes<br/>
Junkyard food meets 808s<br/>
Better say your grace<br/>
Stay your place, play your bass<br/>
And wait on a upright<br/>
Right up to them niggas that don't like us<br/>
Writer, fiber optics on high fiber<br/>
Move<br/>
Quick like that, no, I go as, "ain't shit like that"<br/>
Magnum entendre, rollin' on a rubber<br/>
Hit Virgin for the album, I was floatin' on the cover<br/>
I pit my car, they let a lad in<br/>
I was floatin' on the cover, made a message out a mess<br/>
Got 'em clothes up the flow and taught 'em how to dress<br/>
Made a space so they can milk this way<br/>
Had 'em open up the udders<br/>
Broken off hat had folks in all colors<br/>
I wish a nigga would try and open y'all shutters<br/>
Cartier frames, Aoki on a shirt<br/>
And red and white chukkas<br/>
Why you goin' all hard tho?<br/>
NASCAR star got bars by the carload<br/>
You know LF won to come out the top<br/>
But for this ten I'm a just open up the car door<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Might spit the stash box sequence that I open up the cargo<br/>
If I break it down to your lil homie, might get a nigga CARTO<br/>
You ain't gotta worry 'bout ours tho<br/>
DROGAS Light, DROGAS<br/>
And I might drop SKULLS as an art show<br/>
K-dot wants stretch marks<br/>
I wanna own everything that's west of the best parts<br/>
K.R.I.T., everything from the legs down<br/>
Mickey Factz, everything where the neck starts<br/>
Necklace, head heart, go, get set, mark, oh<br/>
<br/>
Turn the mics up<br/>
Like a nigga 'round fight club<br/>
And the fuzz came through to indict us<br/>
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply then turn around and drive all the price up<br/>
I be speaking it right<br/>
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white<br/>
Oh Lord<br/>
I be speaking it right<br/>
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white<br/>
All right, all right, oh Lord<br/>
<br/>
But, I'm back to the mentally<br/>
And it's not about natural ability<br/>
You would think that Kaep took a shat on the Statue of Liberty<br/>
God damn<br/>
It's like we're trapped in a memory<br/>
Untrue facts where black is an injury<br/>
It makes we wanna snap, just slap me an enemy<br/>
Then go into the back and just rap to infinity<br/>
Fuck, be more like Chance<br/>
Solo acts be more like bands<br/>
Adversaries be more like fans<br/>
BDs and GDs be more like fam<br/>
I'm just vying for the summer<br/>
Women lie, men lie<br/>
And everybody lie about the numbers<br/>
Hard to be smart when the only thing on your mind<br/>
Is dying from a thumper<br/>
I know I'm weird but nigga it's real<br/>
Better to hear it from a nigga like Lu<br/>
Before you hear it from a nigga like Trump<br/>
Talking to a nigga like you<br/>
Oh Lord<br/>
<br/>
Turn the mics up<br/>
Like a nigga 'round fight club<br/>
And the fuzz came through to indict us<br/>
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply then turn around and drive all the price up<br/>
I be speaking it right<br/>
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white<br/>
Oh Lord<br/>
I be speaking it right<br/>
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white<br/>
All right, all right, oh Lord
