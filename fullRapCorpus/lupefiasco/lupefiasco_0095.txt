<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Really? This is what you guys been doing?<br/>
Searching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
Before the break there were none<br/>
And as it broke there was one<br/>
From moon to sun, it goes on and on<br/>
The winter battle was won, the summer children were born<br/>
And so the story goes on and on<br/>
Come on woman in your left beats<br/>
Those in bed with the house keys<br/>
So fair weather feels heartbreak from here to eternity<br/>
Come on woman in your wrong time<br/>
Far far far from the virgin pine<br/>
Rise on now from the dead leaves<br/>
Come back to me<br/>
Oh, she sings her favorite song<br/>
Left to her tears and dreams, it goes on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Standing in line for the new one<br/>
Not the black, but the blue one<br/>
And I don't even know what it do, son<br/>
Steve Jobs said that it's too fun<br/>
Fun in a bun is what I need<br/>
It's cold out here, put my arms in the sleeves<br/>
I'll probably lose my place if I leave<br/>
But I really need to pee<br/>
If I do it right here they'll see<br/>
Makes you wonder, how do snipers<br/>
Marathon bikers<br/>
Next time: diapers<br/>
They say it has all new features<br/>
Faster processors and much better speakers<br/>
Great for kids, a necessity for teachers<br/>
For work or home, a revolutionary way of being alone<br/>
I mean, should we really get a loan?<br/>
Hey what's the manager's... tell it to your phone<br/>
Cupertino heart with Chinese parts<br/>
Built by the poor, but designed by the smart<br/>
They open the door so you go<br/>
On your mark, get ready, set, bye<br/>
Imagine a world where everything starts with an I<br/>
But it still ends with a die<br/>
Probably got an app for that, you could try<br/>
Brother iClouds, right into the great wifi<br/>
Siri, can iGod really hear me?<br/>
"Does not compute - can you repeat more clearly? "<br/>
"Woaaaaah"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
A vessel in the bloodline<br/>
A thirteenth Zodiac sign<br/>
A stitch in time, it goes on and on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Standing in line for some new Ones<br/>
Had a bunch of blessings but I blew them<br/>
Asked Google how to use them<br/>
Sent me to a section about used guns<br/>
New runs, nuns'll scream, moms with jeans<br/>
Match their teens' jeans and genies who try to chew gum<br/>
Aw man, it's so confusing<br/>
Confusion in the bun is what I have<br/>
Good thing that God accepts cash<br/>
Maybe buy my way out his wrath<br/>
Sceptically, why am I way off this path?<br/>
Atheism's cheaper, and accepts Visa<br/>
My thoughts is in queing up for sneakers<br/>
Won't discriminate, getting all eight<br/>
In every color that they make<br/>
Beaverton hearts with Chinese parts<br/>
Built by the poor and designed by the smart<br/>
On your mark, get set, cop em!<br/>
Imagine a life that revolves around shopping<br/>
Conspicuous consumption<br/>
That means it serves no other function<br/>
But to show off to someone<br/>
Others who only try to show off to you - look at your fellow loyal customers<br/>
Isn't harmony great?<br/>
Look at all these friends that marketing makes<br/>
How many fries can these arteries take?<br/>
I'll give McDonald's a little help here<br/>
I think they should expand into health care<br/>
And then you'll have all ends covered<br/>
Even make caskets, have it all umbrella'd<br/>
Can you make a corporation fear me?<br/>
"Couldn't hear your order, can you speak less clearly? "<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3:]</i><br/>
That witch was burning the ground<br/>
Will someday come back around<br/>
From dust from to dust it goes on and on<br/>
<br/>
Before daybreak there were none<br/>
And as it broke there was one<br/>
And still the story goes on and on
