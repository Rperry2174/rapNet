<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
When the fighters are all around<br/>
All the lovers are underground<br/>
No one will save you anymore<br/>
So what's happening, what you rapping about,<br/>
Is it boys? Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?<br/>
The world?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Or is it something they can never believe?<br/>
Or is it something you can never achieve?<br/>
Is it<br/>
Beyond your means?<br/>
Is it<br/>
Inside your dreams?<br/>
Can it<br/>
Never come out cause it's scared to<br/>
Unprepared to<br/>
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird to<br/>
You don't want them to hear you<br/>
You just wish there was a door that would appear that you can go disappear through<br/>
Well I'm feeling your pain<br/>
I was feeling the same<br/>
But I said I'd never feel that again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Man<br/>
I really miss my pops<br/>
Hope that God watches over him and that he's on top<br/>
That there is no more disease and that he's alright<br/>
That he's one of the generals inside the army of the light<br/>
And grandma, you know I had to bite something from you<br/>
So after every show it's "peace, and much love to you"<br/>
Auntie Tweetie's on the way, please look out for that girl<br/>
I know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I hope that God forgive us, all of us sinners<br/>
Turn us back into beginners, put us up where the winners go<br/>
Holy apartments in the gardens in which the rivers flow<br/>
Thank you for all your blessings and all of your miracles<br/>
I thank all my fans and all my supporters<br/>
Shout out to Bishop G, congrats on your new baby daughter<br/>
I tip my hat to all my family and friends<br/>
Now we just got one more to go<br/>
L - U - P - END<br/>
<br/>
