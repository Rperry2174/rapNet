<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Say these niggas ain't ridin' on low, oh<br/>
Push Benz through the bitch<br/>
And a nigga gotta go<br/>
DROGAS<br/>
I need a trophy for this shit, dawg<br/>
I need a trophy for this shit<br/>
<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
That's where I'm from<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
They don't want none<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
Them hoes can't come<br/>
Go hard to go home<br/>
I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone<br/>
City of the year<br/>
<br/>
Ayy, born in the middle of the West<br/>
Lil' nigga, living in the middle of death<br/>
Raised 'round killers, that's why little impress<br/>
Outside white folks, it must sound I'm a little oppressed<br/>
And I'm sorry, my niggas, but I think you the best<br/>
You don't need no Khaled, 'cause that's on me, valid<br/>
Let me push my brother, we don't need no malice<br/>
Niggas raised in the projects, now they gon' need a palace<br/>
<br/>
Niggas want JJ's, don't eat salads<br/>
Fourteen with a AK, and he'll let a nigga have it<br/>
Fireworks in Capetown, man it's so tragic<br/>
Fireworks on the lake front, shit look like Magic<br/>
<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
That's where I'm from<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
They don't want none<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
Them hoes can't come<br/>
Go hard to go home<br/>
I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone<br/>
<br/>
My city look pretty in the summer<br/>
6th grade, moved out to the hundreds<br/>
Prolly wouldn't have made it hangin' 'round my mama's<br/>
Havin' worldwide, made my come-up<br/>
Bishop was a BD, dope claimed lord<br/>
Cliqued all up, put it all on CD<br/>
Neutron don, but I prolly been a GD<br/>
God knows best, so he put me where he need me<br/>
Puttin' truth in all these rhymes<br/>
State tried to shut a nigga down<br/>
Gave my nigga Chilly all that time<br/>
People think it came out of nowhere<br/>
It's all by design<br/>
They took away the chiefs<br/>
And the streets lost their minds<br/>
<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
That's where I'm from<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
They don't want none<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
Them hoes can't come<br/>
Go hard to go home<br/>
I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone<br/>
City of the year<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rondo:]</i><br/>
Turn up, let's get it<br/>
Turn up, life in Windy City<br/>
Chiraq<br/>
Lupe, what up, bro?<br/>
In the 'Go zone, in the 'Go zone<br/>
<br/>
Go hard or go home, we turnt up<br/>
I'm from Chiraq, when we come around we rust stuff<br/>
I gotta keep that 'cause when I come around they act tough<br/>
Chi Lupe, I'm so hard, I'm burnt up<br/>
City of the year that's my shit, I'm ridin' 'round in traffic<br/>
See there he got the mop stick<br/>
Ain't shit change, I ain't quit<br/>
Ain't shit change, I ain't switch<br/>
I'm just smart, tryna get rich<br/>
I'm so high, you in a ditch<br/>
I'ma get mine, Money Makin' Mitch<br/>
You talkin' shit, you don't exist<br/>
I can leave you lost in the mist<br/>
I'm Rondo, real as it gets<br/>
Either with me or you against<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
That's where I'm from<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
They don't want none<br/>
City of the year, city of the year<br/>
Them hoes can't come<br/>
Go hard to go home<br/>
I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone<br/>
City of the year
