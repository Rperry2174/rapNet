<i>[Hook: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
Girl I want you to know (whoo)<br/>
I can't get you out of my head<br/>
My head my head (naawww)<br/>
<br/>
Girl I want you to know<br/>
I don't even know what you did<br/>
You did you did<br/>
But I love it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Uh Uh<br/>
Everything hooks<br/>
Everything works, you're a real good cause<br/>
I'm a real good verse, freestyle unrehearsed<br/>
So clean no curse<br/>
And when the song's gone man everything hurts<br/>
So I put it in reverse<br/>
Go back to the scene where I seen you first<br/>
Yeah, I need you to sing that single again<br/>
Play that video I seen you up in<br/>
A hundred million scenes in my mind all day<br/>
Call in and request on the line always<br/>
Yeah, the president of your fan club<br/>
Leave them players all behind like a bad love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
Girl I want you to know<br/>
I can't get you out of my head<br/>
My head my head (I can't get you out now)<br/>
<br/>
Girl I want you to know<br/>
I don't even know what you did<br/>
You did you did<br/>
But I love it (Wait)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Playa need a minute<br/>
Like a time out in tennis 'for I finish<br/>
How'd I get in this<br/>
Maybe 'was your hair, maybe 'was your flair<br/>
Maybe it's the heels and the way you wear<br/>
Maybe it's your real and the way you care<br/>
You don't care if I'm ill or a millionaire<br/>
The only thing that matters that the feeling's there<br/>
Your smile is so bright it's like a grills in there<br/>
High off life, don't need a pill in there (nah)<br/>
You're killing me, I think I need a will in here<br/>
Got me feeling real skills impaired<br/>
Hard to describe why you're still in here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
Girl I want you to know<br/>
I can't get you out of my head<br/>
My head my head<br/>
<br/>
Girl I want you to know<br/>
I don't even know what you did<br/>
You did you did<br/>
But I love it (but I love it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Trey Songz &amp; Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Don't care what nobody say<br/>
Cause I like it girl<br/>
Might go crazy try'na figure this out love (but I like it girl)<br/>
Don't even know why I feel this way<br/>
Cause I like it girl<br/>
Caught up in something that I can't get out of (but we like it girl)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
Girl I want you to know<br/>
I can't get you out of my head (I can't get you out now)<br/>
My head my head (said I can't get you out now)<br/>
<br/>
Girl I want you to know<br/>
I don't even know what you did<br/>
You did you did (you did you did you did)<br/>
But I love it<br/>
<br/>
Girl I want you to know (I want you to know)<br/>
I can't get you out of my head (lupe)<br/>
My head my head (trey)<br/>
I want you to know (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Girl I want you to know (oh oh oh)<br/>
I don't even know what you did (just making sure)<br/>
You did you did (i don't even know)<br/>
But I love it<br/>
I can't get you out of my head (lupe, trey)<br/>
My head
