<i>[Intro - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Immaculate mother of the holy soul<br/>
On behalf of the overdose<br/>
We come to you uncomfortable in our ways<br/>
Please don't slam the door all in my face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Tried to go to church, church ain't work<br/>
Still want to kill niggas<br/>
Tried to go work, but work ain't work<br/>
Work ain't work for the feel nigga<br/>
Really make me feel like a field nigga<br/>
Make me feel worse, really tryna' chill<br/>
But inside I feel like a steel mill, nigga<br/>
And it's hard when these niggas steal mama<br/>
What, when you and God gotta mill still mama<br/>
Living off a meal deal mama<br/>
Can't stunt with them lil wheels mama<br/>
Need a real purse real heels mama<br/>
How dem liquors and them pills feel mama, lil mama<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1 - Nikki Jean:]</i><br/>
No man shall prosper<br/>
Lord knows if I said it, it's gospel, lil mama<br/>
Madonna<br/>
No man shall prosper<br/>
Lord knows if I said it, it's gospel, your momma<br/>
Madonna<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Nikki Jean &amp; Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
No man shall touch this<br/>
Lord said nobody can fuck with, your momma<br/>
Madonna<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
I be just trying make it <i>[x4]</i><br/>
They be just trying break us <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
White T on they shoulders<br/>
What drags em off through the streets<br/>
In the whip wit' they soldiers<br/>
Stations of the police<br/>
Trying to stick all this time to me<br/>
Trying to stick all these crimes to me<br/>
Could you just send a dime to me<br/>
Mama please send a sign to me<br/>
What's looking like life?<br/>
Is probation and a fine to me<br/>
Lawyer said I'd be alright<br/>
But I think that he lying to me<br/>
They really wanna throw those lines to me<br/>
Put me in a line, put the knives to me<br/>
Put me in the sky, put it to my side<br/>
Then push it inside of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 3 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Holy mother of the blessed soul<br/>
They don't love you there<br/>
They love you here<br/>
I love you like I'm Mexico<br/>
Say: (Santa Maria, Madre de Dios<br/>
Ruega por nosotros pecadores<br/>
Ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte)<br/>
Amen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
They sent them all to the slaughter<br/>
Baby mama, no father<br/>
He was hanging round them murderers<br/>
And them prostitutes and them robbers, yeah<br/>
Them dope fiends and that water, yeah<br/>
Wit' angel dust in they nostrils, yeah<br/>
They hit em up wit' that chopper<br/>
She was holdin' him, in her hands<br/>
Just like Stigmata, yeah<br/>
Said you gon' live here forever<br/>
Salvation and treasure<br/>
You gon' live here forever, yeah<br/>
Died like Ricky on his mama couch<br/>
Right there in his mama house<br/>
Only child, the holy mama's your mama now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Lupe Fiasco (x2):]</i><br/>
Mama said my son never been no killer<br/>
Mama said my son never been no gangster<br/>
No drug dealer, no gang member<br/>
Mama said my son never been no trouble<br/>
Mama said my son never been no trouble
