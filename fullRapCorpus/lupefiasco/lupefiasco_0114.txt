<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I'ma just go... and then we'll figure it out from there<br/>
They say form follows function<br/>
And if you just function properly then things will form themselves<br/>
Yeah, that's kind of what it is<br/>
So on that note... America's most<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas<br/>
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin' around my temple<br/>
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix<br/>
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought<br/>
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt<br/>
And they sink in the same sea that we walk<br/>
Not that we Jesus, we just don't wait until it thaws<br/>
But you can hold my hand like applause, pause/paws<br/>
With no homophobia involved<br/>
Now if I would've said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls<br/>
That would've been the call, but naw<br/>
You can't see in ours, but we can see in yours<br/>
You can't see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, just like that, we just let it roll, you know?<br/>
Yeah, and check it, check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
So when that pond thaws and it's no longer Gretzky<br/>
That's when we jetski<br/>
I gotta catch up to myself, I kind of left me<br/>
Are the windows still blocked up? Let's see<br/>
Maybe see something we couldn't view before<br/>
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought<br/>
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours<br/>
Might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw<br/>
Lions won't cross the line<br/>
Cougars won't move a paw<br/>
Chickens won't cross the road<br/>
Dogs won't roof at all<br/>
Always had flow, just added a front door, roof, and walls<br/>
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls<br/>
But that's only if you super dawg<br/>
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults<br/>
You can never really tell just who's the fraud<br/>
Truth might still be alive like true and false<br/>
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed<br/>
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced<br/>
Now that's three me's, like you warming up your vocal chords<br/>
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse<br/>
Like Mister Ed<br/>
Get out of pocket have a horse's head in your bed<br/>
Now that's what I call a good night's rest<br/>
<br/>
You know? You know, just plays like that<br/>
When you just let it flow<br/>
When you sit back and just let it go, you know?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
And now my vocals warm<br/>
Add a fifth and a sixth now I'm ready to perform<br/>
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed<br/>
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me<br/>
We don't forget the other five as we<br/>
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies<br/>
And Morgan Frees<br/>
Send it around the room like we smoking trees<br/>
But it's no purple in the circle then there ain't no rolling<br/>
Bees just spoken words, thought provoking reeds<br/>
Hydro, I'm still strolling on the seas<br/>
Aloe, like the lotion from the leaves<br/>
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E. Cheese<br/>
All without touching weed<br/>
But I'm still hungry and I'm having lunch for three<br/>
This is my form, now what the function be<br/>
<br/>
And aww at what I draw<br/>
And ooh at what I say like Imogen Heap<br/>
Good night niggas, go to sleep<br/>
You know? It's like form follows function<br/>
And if you function properly then<br/>
The form will come out of it<br/>
And whatever it is, it<br/>
It just be what it is, you know?
