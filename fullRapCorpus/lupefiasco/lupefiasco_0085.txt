<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I waited all my life to play<br/>
I still can't find a way<br/>
But if I work it one more day<br/>
I might just break the Chain<br/>
I might just break the Chain<br/>
I might just break the Chain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Freedom, we can use some of that especially where we from<br/>
Where we grew up like a green thumb<br/>
It's like a criminal is the only thing you can become<br/>
Look at what I became<br/>
Something like a phenom, nothin' but a g-thang<br/>
Things I've seen when I'm looking out of these frames<br/>
Pictures I painted on the walls where we hang<br/>
From the trees we hung<br/>
Strange fruit man look at how we swung<br/>
How the hell you gonna tell us something<br/>
We ain't have a father<br/>
How to try to grow up and be one<br/>
See umm feel it in my bones<br/>
That I'm sittin on a throne<br/>
Like a killer with a chrome<br/>
When I spit another poem<br/>
Shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home<br/>

<i>[Sway - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Super swatter, the kid remains but I represent<br/>
I ain't no paper planes. I'm fly<br/>
Plus, I don't write no more, sorta from the top<br/>
I'll show you razor stay sharp<br/>
But I knew how to razor blade<br/>
I've paid my dues and now I wait for change<br/>
Because the flows so rude<br/>
It goes without asking Lupe<br/>
I'm so big, you aim to break<br/>
Quick to cut off any baggage like some samurai, i like to travel light<br/>
I've gotta leave you at home Delilah, this is Samsonite<br/>
No case for the police<br/>
Said I have seen Killah's, I aint never seen 'em<br/>
Ghostface, only thing I'm watchin' is my Panerai<br/>
I've got an alibi, i was taking pics of Chicago call me Camera Chi(shy)<br/>

<i>[Lupe Fiasco - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Chain broke, pick up Nicorete for your chain smoke<br/>
No cigarettes on my plane, yo<br/>
Stunt your ham bones from the game's throat<br/>
Put it on mine, take a long time<br/>
B-A-Barock is how I'm livin' online<br/>
On a webisode like let's go let 'em know<br/>
That I put up the footage that I'm takin' your shine<br/>
Wanna see the real chain look in your mind<br/>
Your brain look like your lil wayne brotha<br/>
Overgrow, overload, broken zone<br/>
Niggas playing games in the hood they got you stuck-up<br/>
Playa thinkin' that its cool to be a pimp still<br/>
We gon' set it free like a fish in a pimp hill<br/>
Take this home, rearrange it, change it<br/>
Danger, Sway-zer, Lupe Laser. Pow!<br/>
