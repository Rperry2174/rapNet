<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
<br/>
the cool.<br/>
<br/>
Turn me up<br/>
uh-huh..<br/>
yeah..<br/>
<br/>
He came back<br/>
In the same suit that he was buried in<br/>
Similar to the one his grand father was married in<br/>
Yes... he was still fresh to death<br/>
bling, two ear-rings, a chain laying on his chest<br/>
He still had it cuz they couldn't find it<br/>
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it<br/>
smelled the Hennesy from when his niggas got reminded<br/>
and poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it, But...<br/>
He couldn't sip it fast enough<br/>
So the liquor was just filling the casket up<br/>
floating down by his feet was the letter from his sister<br/>
Second Grade hand-writing simply read "I miss ya"<br/>
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture<br/>
Right next to it one of his man's stuck a swisher<br/>
He had a notion as he laid there soaking<br/>
Saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open<br/>
and he...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
This life goes passing you by<br/>
It might go fast if you lie<br/>
You go and you live then you die...<br/>
<br/>
O-oh-oh-ohh<br/>
<br/>
If life goes passing you by<br/>
Don't cry<br/>
If you breaking the rules<br/>
Making your moves<br/>
Paying your dues...<br/>
Chasing the cool<br/>
<br/>
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface<br/>
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with<br/>
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it<br/>
and when he couldn't dirt spit... swollowed it<br/>
Working like a.. hmm.. reverse archaeologist<br/>
Except.. his buried treasure was sunshine<br/>
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove<br/>
it reflected off the gold and almost made son blind<br/>
He grabbed on to some grass, he climbed<br/>
Pulled himself up out of his own grave and looked at the time<br/>
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots<br/>
That had got him in the box wringing Henny out his socks<br/>
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older<br/>
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulders - so..<br/>
With a right hand that was all bones and no reason to stay<br/>
Decided to walk home<br/>
so he..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
He begged for some change to get him on a train<br/>
"Damn that nigga stank", is what they complained<br/>
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames<br/>
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became<br/>
A long look... Wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed<br/>
Matter fact only thing on his brain was brains.. yeah<br/>
And getting back in his lane, doing his thang<br/>
First he had to find something to slang<br/>
Next stop was his block<br/>
It had the same cops<br/>
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot<br/>
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks<br/>
It just felt weird being on the opposite<br/>
They figured that he wasn't from there<br/>
so they pulled out and robbed him<br/>
with the same gun they shot him with<br/>
Put it to his head and said "You scared ain't ya?"<br/>
He said: "Hustler for death. No heaven for a gangsta." <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
