(Uncle Lupe)<br/>
Alright it's time to go to sleep<br/>
(Hey Uncle Lupe)<br/>
What?<br/>
(Can you please tell us a bedtime story?)<br/>
Ugh, it's late man<br/>
Okay, okay okay, check this out, listen<br/>
<br/>
Cold killer, bold old gorilla<br/>
Bold as a font with the thickness<br/>
Old as yellow gold in a Chevrolet with a stick shift<br/>
The story goes his mother left him on a church step<br/>
First step was out the front door then the first left<br/>
Down the block to the spots where the worst kept<br/>
Thirty years later got a thirty tier caper<br/>
To shoot up the scene and scheme<br/>
Plot, broken all down to two rounds of scotch<br/>
A pound means now and we too down to stop<br/>
Say ya got enough round for two thousand cops<br/>
Military grade, these things shoot round the block<br/>
Shh threat, check<br/>
The dame will hang out like chains round the neck<br/>
He ever seen her before, her face don't connect<br/>
No, so keep it on the low, go<br/>
Seizes her by the arm<br/>
Looks right into the eyes cause these be the charms<br/>
Sheba, King Tut suite at the Khalifa<br/>
Tied to a chair getting burned by cohibas<br/>
A well dressed thug who run clubs in the Koreas<br/>
The room smells like fresh hand made tortillas<br/>
He recognized the tattoos of a real big Maui brother<br/>
Known for bad news when his cash rules<br/>
Are you familiar with the shell of the cashews?<br/>
As he holds the needle up to the light bulb<br/>
White girls into drunk, he stands up runs to the window and jumps<br/>
<br/>
Aim for the pool... splash<br/>
The impact from that almost split him in half<br/>
Voice from the past asks did he enjoy the bath<br/>
Laughs with his arm in a cast, hold up<br/>
<br/>
Never what it seems, everybody wanna be seen<br/>
On the cover of a magazine<br/>
Everybody want big things<br/>
Everybody want big dreams<br/>
Everybody want bling bling<br/>
Everybody wanna be the king<br/>
Everybody bling<br/>
Everybody sings<br/>
Everybody wanna big thing<br/>
In the valley of kings and pyramid schemes<br/>
It's never what it seems, everybody wanna be seen<br/>
On the cover of a magazine<br/>
Everybody wanna sip lean<br/>
Everybody want a big dreams<br/>
Everybody want bling bling<br/>
Everybody want C.R.E.A.M<br/>
Everybody wanna have a team<br/>
Everybody wanna be the king<br/>
Everybody want a big scheme in the land of pyramid schemes<br/>
<br/>
As he tried to do the math with Smearcon the fed<br/>
The contract states from here upon your dead<br/>
The girl at the bar is an underworld star<br/>
Settling on debts with north Zanzibar<br/>
Your names on the list, kitsch<br/>
A hundred million dollars worth of high grade fish<br/>
Tuna, Tokyo cartels worlds biggest consumer<br/>
A rumor bout a schooner off the coast of Montezuma<br/>
They say you slit the throat of a well known kahuna<br/>
Then torched the boat and fled into the Dunya<br/>
Youâ€™re hated more than a Kalua pig at a Jumu'ah<br/>
They want your head on a platter, not right now but sooner<br/>
I got you a .45 and a Mitsubishi tuner<br/>
Wait, wait I've never been to Costa Rica<br/>
And then it all comes back<br/>
Just as Smearcon falls with a ninja star in his head like<br/>
Then they slowly enter the room<br/>
I grabbed a .45, the ninja stars resume<br/>
I catch him in the cast and answer them with a blast, blow<br/>
Three more shots for good measure<br/>
Only exit is another window, pfft whatever<br/>
Short fall to the roof of the car<br/>
Then I get in, left arm covered in ninja stars<br/>
Then a zero to a hundred baby real quick<br/>
Look around the car for something else to kill with<br/>
Lamborghini headlights in the rear view<br/>
These Parisian streets not meant to veer through<br/>
Especially with just one hand<br/>
I let go to shoot back but the gun jams<br/>
Mitsubishi not built to outrun Lambs<br/>
So they gaining, heavy raining<br/>
Rear view explodes from deadly aiming<br/>
Arm paining, blood draining<br/>
Pains, head for the Louvre<br/>
Drive right through the glass pyramid with dope moves<br/>
A little shook from the landing<br/>
Driving through the Louvre in a rally car with great handling<br/>
Was at the Mona Lisa<br/>
Stop the car right in front of the dealer have a breather<br/>
Press play on the radio, voice from the speaker<br/>
Says get to Belgrade and take an ad out in the daily Politika<br/>
They says for a good time call this Ecuador slash Venezuelan chica<br/>
Next day at the airport meeted by a greeter who looks Corsican but Greeker<br/>
A little older wearing Michael Jordan sneakers<br/>
But I follow the leader<br/>
1995 S Class, in the back seat is a dead man who's car I just crashed<br/>
Smearcon's alive, audience now wonders how Smearcon survived<br/>
Let alone not be hurt, he taps a metal plate in his head from his Afghanistan work<br/>
What Visine for red retinas, what else would you expect from head predators<br/>
Ex-lecturer, at Exeter, the dean too secular<br/>
So now I'm totes hecklers, everywhere<br/>
Now Smearcon's on the team, so everybody's down for the scheme<br/>
<br/>
(The final chapter in the incredible <i>[?]</i> saga)<br/>
(Smearcon's back!)<br/>
<br/>
Now it's time to finish this, getting too late for international syndicates<br/>
To which the driver reveals his membership<br/>
This won't end well, he pulls out a grenade and says<br/>
(Damn you all to hell!)<br/>
<br/>
(Wait, what happened? Uncle Lupe what's going on?)<br/>
Go to sleep<br/>
(But what happened? I don't understand)<br/>
Nope<br/>
(Please finish the story please)<br/>
Storytime's over<br/>
You asked for a story I gave you one<br/>
Take it, just take it<br/>
(This is the worst bedtime story ever)<br/>
Bye<br/>
<br/>
Psych sucker, Smearcon is back<br/>
You really think that he would go out like that?<br/>
They're under attack, MAC under the back...<br/>
<br/>
I'm just playing, it's really over<br/>
Its the end of the tape<br/>
Thank y'all man<br/>
Pharaoh Height two thirty<br/>
Shout to DJ BUSY<br/>
You know how we do<br/>
Hope you all enjoyed it man<br/>
Scott what up<br/>
What you thought I couldn't do this no more, huh?<br/>
Man listen, lets let this play out<br/>
