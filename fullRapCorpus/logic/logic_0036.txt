Hmmm, yeah! (Sinatra)<br/>
<br/>
Aight, yeah, yeah, homie I'm comin'<br/>
I'm coming and I'm never gonna give up<br/>
My mentality is making rappers feel like<br/>
They can never even live up to Logic<br/>
You bust I dodge it<br/>
Think you seein' me, nah, you just miragin'<br/>
I'm gunnin, I'm gunnin like a semi-automatic<br/>
That's really equipped with lyricism, I'll let 'em have it<br/>
I blast it, any style that you comin' at me with<br/>
I master it, I slam mothafuckas that I'm out on you bastards<br/>
<br/>
(Syke, I'm just playin' with y'all)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know I had to keep it going<br/>
Kid rhymes that blow minds and see foreign<br/>
Real recognize real and you lookin' foreign<br/>
I was spittin' flows before I was even born in the womb<br/>
And I'm a keep it up until the tomb<br/>
And as for the fame, yeah I know it's coming soon<br/>
Cause I'm goin' in raw, finna bust up in your room<br/>
I hit a beat and it's ergence to emerge in the game<br/>
Pukin the dukin's I'm too sick to spit that Yoga flame<br/>
The way I figure this is rap second renassaince<br/>
Spittin' dirty sentences, so I'll they affecting medicine<br/>
Ha, I'm havin' sentence spittin' fire like a demon<br/>
As the internet I let my flow to get to streamin', I'm beamin'<br/>
Flawlessly listen in that women in yo head while you dreamin'<br/>
Leo Dicaprio flow all up in that bitch schemin'<br/>
Tryna' get you to buy that album, tryna get you feenin'<br/>
See my vision as I commentate it<br/>
You wanna see naked rerun of the bait but the hater ate it<br/>
Success is truly overrated<br/>
I've seen caster with a blow up to pop and get deflated<br/>
See yeah, you made it but all your fans hate it<br/>
And it's kinda lookin' like you were sittin' negotiatin'<br/>
When it comes down to the rap game you see I'm intergrated<br/>
Half white half black I had it incorporated<br/>
Get the money<br/>
<br/>
(Whoever did this is a real pro)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm just a youngin' with a dream<br/>
With expenses 'til sixteen<br/>
Quite the microphone fiend<br/>
Now the rap is not mean<br/>
When I step up on the scene<br/>
All the girls see my scheme<br/>
'Til I open up my mouth and they find out my lyrics mean<br/>
Had I meet up with Raheem<br/>
Drinkin' a whole team<br/>
But before I execute a perfect plan I gotta scheme<br/>
Cause right now I'm on the dolo<br/>
Everything about this tape I did it on the solo<br/>
Yeah, I said it's hurricane Logic<br/>
Remember they can't dodge it<br/>
They gon' be bumpin' me from the birds to the projects<br/>
I get on the mic and excite anybody around me<br/>
You're probably wondering why the boy has not found me<br/>
It's not that easy, I gotta work from the ground<br/>
Be the center of attention, look at the people around me<br/>
Black on the inside, my outside Ritz<br/>
What's a cracker without a cheese<br/>
I gotta stack chips<br/>
<br/>
"Would you care for a glass of grape juice?"<br/>
"Nigga, what the fuck is juice?"<br/>
"You have interfered with our affairs for the last time"
