I'm just a spectator looking in<br/>
But I can tell you how I think things should've been<br/>
And all the reasons why the world's where it is today<br/>
Please listen to my words, what I have to say<br/>
You see, in Gaza they're fighting for land<br/>
You see, they need this land cause it's a part of their plan, understand<br/>
The Jews needed a place after Hitler<br/>
So they got about three quarters of Palestinian land<br/>
Palestinians then had to make refuges<br/>
In places like Lebanon<br/>
In places where none of them had ever gone<br/>
Thousands were massacred for not leaving<br/>
See, I'd do the same, kill me, I'll die believing<br/>
I understand the mind of a man who commits suicide<br/>
But don't agree with any innocent that has to die<br/>
And what's gonna happen after this? Will they stop with the Gaza strip?<br/>
I don't think so<br/>
I sat with a Jew to learn<br/>
He told me that's it's not meant to go to Israel until the prophet returns<br/>
I said is this true<br/>
He told me go and read the Torah<br/>
Cause if it's true, then they're following another order<br/>
How can a nation that knows what it's like to be slaughtered go and do the same to someone else?<br/>
I'm just a spectator looking in<br/>
But I can tell you how I think things should've been<br/>
A couple reasons why the world's where it is today<br/>
Please listen to my words, what I have to say<br/>
I don't know everything and never will I claim to know<br/>
What our purpose is and what we really need to grow<br/>
But I do know we're dying for a common cause<br/>
A global word that is well known, war<br/>
I've been to Africa and seen a grown man on the floor<br/>
Disabled to the point I couldn't look anymore<br/>
A real beggar, in a real state of poverty<br/>
But he prays everyday, so he knows that there's gotta be another life<br/>
Where he can live as a strong man<br/>
And the ownership of Africa doesn't end up in the wrong hands, Western palms<br/>
Buying and destroying people just to trade arms<br/>
Could someone tell me why Africa is just surviving?<br/>
The whole land was a resource plus they got diamonds<br/>
Used to be able to run your hand through the sand<br/>
And get a handful of diamonds, do you understand?<br/>
How precious is the land if it's like that?<br/>
You see, it's wrong to say it was taken by the white man<br/>
It was taken by the power hungry<br/>
And the people that never saw the beauty of Africa, fam<br/>
They only saw the money, to them it was the land of opportunity<br/>
It's terrorism when it's done by either you or me<br/>
Treat these words like my eulogy<br/>
And remember that I died being exactly what I choose to be<br/>
Insha'Allah we all can see<br/>
That God is the goodness in you and me<br/>
No religion has ownership<br/>
See, the Quran and the Bible and the Torah were all wrote with ink<br/>
See, I think the masses are miseducated<br/>
See, most of the politicians were born racist<br/>
See, it's obvious that somehow we're all related<br/>
Millions of years back, before we separated<br/>
I heard Tony Benn say it in a speech<br/>
See, how can you murder another brother because he's weak?<br/>
Your ancestors could have been cousins, so take a seat<br/>
And try and reason with your brother fam before you beef<br/>
I'm just a spectator looking in from my view<br/>
I'm not different or special, I'm just like you<br/>
Bleed blood and shed tears when my heart's hurting<br/>
I get energy from everything in life, I'm learning<br/>
How to say my thoughts, release my stress through my words<br/>
Make you visualise everything you've ever heard<br/>
Picture ancient Egyptians meditating<br/>
To the elements, telepathically debating<br/>
Until the pirates came in the form of tradesmen<br/>
Promised them a Paradise in exchange for a Heaven<br/>
Temptation and misinterpretation, so they jeopardise the whole of the nation<br/>
You see, a Paradise is where we might choose to go<br/>
But a Heaven is the place where the angels go<br/>
So they can reason with the prophets, not bathe in gold<br/>
And it's not late for no one to save your soul<br/>
I'm a citizen of truth, love and loyalty<br/>
Every person on the planet is royalty<br/>
These are my thoughts, how I look at things<br/>
Fam, I'm just a spectator looking in
