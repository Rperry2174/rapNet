<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone<br/>
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (Keep doing it, I'm loving it)<br/>
People calling me, asking me for money, man<br/>
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is a dial tone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid<br/>
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days<br/>
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all<br/>
Bumping Triple Six<br/>
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks<br/>
Who the bitch riding with me?<br/>
Man, the devil tryna get me<br/>
Motivated, under-educated, and hated<br/>
But finally getting cake like a happy belated<br/>
Bitch I made it, we on<br/>
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it<br/>
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it<br/>
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit<br/>
This is war, I declare it<br/>
Time is money, I can't spare it<br/>
Futuristic, so simplistic<br/>
Please decipher my linguistics<br/>
Slow it down, Robitussin<br/>
I'm the king, ain't no discussion<br/>
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion<br/>
My consumption is the illest<br/>
Section eight, I know you feel this<br/>
On the come up, where they run up on you for nothing at all<br/>
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?<br/>
EBT, that's the card<br/>
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
God damn, God damn, we at it again<br/>
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban<br/>
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up<br/>
Fuck around and get messed up<br/>
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine<br/>
You know that I'm one of a kind<br/>
Lemme get it right now, ho<br/>
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho<br/>
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so<br/>
On the down low, haters drown slow<br/>
On the down low, haters drown slow<br/>
Oh God, my God, we got it all right<br/>
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?<br/>
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?<br/>
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?<br/>
Uh, tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck<br/>
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut<br/>
That's what's up<br/>
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up<br/>
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up<br/>
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough<br/>
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us<br/>
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic cup<br/>
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up<br/>
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up<br/>
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough<br/>
Now they know my name through the nation<br/>
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation<br/>
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations<br/>
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making<br/>
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken<br/>
Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em<br/>
And bitch I'm still the same<br/>
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain<br/>
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name<br/>
Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story<br/>
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)<br/>
I been working hard, I been searching for God<br/>
I been working hard, I been searching for God<br/>
(Please leave a message after the tone)<br/>
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you<br/>
But I insist you call me back cause I miss you<br/>
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call<br/>
Cause lately you feel like I'm just not your sister at all, all<br/>
Uh, I'm sorry for calling and balling, I'm all in<br/>
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me<br/>
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me<br/>
Haunted by vivid memories of the man who raped me<br/>
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I'm me, but still<br/>
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel<br/>
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser<br/>
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone<br/>
And as for <i>[?]</i> he left and he ain't coming back<br/>
I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that<br/>
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting and selling that<br/>
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back<br/>
I been working hard, I been searching for God<br/>
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud<br/>
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me<br/>
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me<br/>
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother<br/>
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya<br/>
Tried to call ya, where are ya?<br/>
And Paris, what a beautiful destination<br/>
And perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful<br/>
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk<br/>
When I see kids around the way I say "how I'm your dad"<br/>
It gets me thinking 'bout incredible moments we've had<br/>
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you<br/>
But do you think you can stop rapping about my drug use?<br/>
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend<br/>
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19<br/>
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there<br/>
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care<br/>
Of anything I need, of your family<br/>
Can I have some tickets to your next show?<br/>
Will you stand with me?<br/>
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?<br/>
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom<br/>
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm<br/>
Maybe you could tell <i>[beep]</i><br/>
I've been feeling under pressure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Hey, what's up, bro? I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all fucked with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga. Hit me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5:]</i><br/>
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant<br/>
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent<br/>
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it<br/>
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place<br/>
Thoughts off in another world, I started seeing another girl<br/>
It fell through, man, what a world<br/>
But I'm so focused on my craft, unemploying my staff<br/>
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft<br/>
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss<br/>
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce<br/>
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood asking for favors<br/>
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior<br/>
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you<br/>
When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh<br/>
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?<br/>
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on girl, don't do me foul<br/>
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now<br/>
I heard you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel<br/>
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?<br/>
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined<br/>
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing<br/>
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth<br/>
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth<br/>
This is everything I love, this is everything I need<br/>
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed<br/>
This is everything I love, everything I need<br/>
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed<br/>
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the ones you don't know, my sister, some of your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati. Then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son. So
