<i>[Hook: x4]</i><br/>
We should shine a light on, a light on<br/>
And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
They lost and I found it, we leave 'em astounded<br/>
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?<br/>
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast<br/>
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease<br/>
Got it capiche, hungry as hell trying to eat now<br/>
Success is the only thing that can't complete us<br/>
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus<br/>
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this<br/>
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood<br/>
Cause selling crack and busting gats don't make my raps good<br/>
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. repping MD to the fullest<br/>
Push us to the limit but never pull us now<br/>
I can't wait 'til I see my name in neon<br/>
That fly shit I be on flowing for eons<br/>
Every day I take chances, Celine Dion<br/>
Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion (let's get it)<br/>
I'm a diamond in a rough, but I shine like discos<br/>
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco<br/>
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go<br/>
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though<br/>
Bumping up in they city like, Oh my God this go<br/>
My business getting better every year like fiscal<br/>
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil<br/>
I'm o-riginal, see, but they trace like stencil<br/>
I stain in the game, but you fade like pencil<br/>
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult<br/>
Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault<br/>
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine<br/>
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time<br/>
Cause when I flow the crowd never roll cause I rock<br/>
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot<br/>
Cause I got no time to bullshit<br/>
<br/>
