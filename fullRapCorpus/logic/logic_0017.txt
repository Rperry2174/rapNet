<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I'm a just go in on this joint right now for y'all<br/>
All my lyricism heads where y'all at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I spit fifties and shit hundreds<br/>
Do shit that's undid<br/>
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts<br/>
I get em wet, no need to touch<br/>
Break they back like dutches<br/>
Keep em close like the toast I clutch<br/>
Never the less<br/>
I'm never depressed<br/>
I keep feelings suppressed<br/>
One of the best but need to listen if I'm a progress<br/>
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap<br/>
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back<br/>
Stop, I shut it down like a bloodclot<br/>
Smoke emcees, like a fuckin bumbaclot<br/>
Mic check, I come to catch wreck<br/>
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck<br/>
I pop emcees like Hymens<br/>
Y'all glass posing in stubs but I'm a diamond<br/>
I reckon you need to listen<br/>
I'm never dissin'<br/>
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission<br/>
Catch me fishin<br/>
Cause I'm eating for a lifetime<br/>
Wisdom in my mind<br/>
I'm a star watch me shine<br/>
Fucking your bitch from behind<br/>
Record it and hit rewind<br/>
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty<br/>
A hip-hop statute<br/>
Rhymes coming at you, God bless you<br/>
When I kick wisdom it never stress you or test you<br/>
Unless you a dumb motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
We gon' get into it like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Said this is mathematic tactics<br/>
Murder this rap shit<br/>
Intravenously inject my prophylactics<br/>
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks<br/>
Similar to black ice cause the flow so slick<br/>
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up<br/>
Do a whole 'lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs<br/>
Yeah, turn my headphones up<br/>
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough<br/>
Raw, rugged and rough<br/>
My alter ego, Mr.Tough<br/>
I'll call your bluff<br/>
Face to face never snuff<br/>
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit<br/>
No mercy cause if I grip the mic they might curse me<br/>
Da Vinci flow<br/>
Before I grip the mic I'm in control<br/>
Before I manifested tendons I was rhyming as a embryo<br/>
Living in vertigo<br/>
Half of these fuckers don't know<br/>
It's Logic<br/>
I said it's Logic
