<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high,<br/>
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high,<br/>
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky,<br/>
I'll be damned if I ain't living the life I always wanted,<br/>
Started from the bottom as a young and gettin' blunted now I run it like a marathon Ho,<br/>
Yeah it's on Ho,<br/>
Hits motherfucker, hits Barry Bonds Ho,<br/>
In the studio for twenty two days,<br/>
I'm too paid,<br/>
Might fuck around and kick flip in my new J's,<br/>
I got a show in Paris then Tokyo so I'm lu paid<br/>
Fucked a shorty in Paris I'm getting crème brûlée<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Fuck a 9 to 5,<br/>
I'm too alive for the real world,<br/>
Never die in the real world Lie in the real world,<br/>
Everything ain't what it seems,<br/>
When you following your dreams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
How you feeling Ho?<br/>
I'm makin the killing Ho, really doe,<br/>
Talking all that shit behind my back just Like a silly (Ho),<br/>
Had a dream Dr. King,<br/>
Now that money ain't a thing<br/>
I've been through a lot of pain, looking like we overcame!<br/>
Goddamn life just ain't the same, all ya know my name<br/>
Fuck the fame, Maryland where I came<br/>
Broke up in the game, and it feels Good, Good, real Good, good<br/>
Now we livin in the hills pissing off the neighborhood,<br/>
It's just me Castro and Six, going crazy in this Bitch,<br/>
Plus my homie John<br/>
And the whole RattPack you know we on,<br/>
Livin the life of a don<br/>
While my homie Slay roll up the swisher<br/>
I get richer while they hate, watch the Money Gravitate<br/>
Finally eat and grab a plate<br/>
Hell yeah that's sounding great<br/>
I've been high I been Low but There's one thing That I know<br/>
It's been a long time coming now my whole team got it,<br/>
And if you're hatin' suck a dick and bitch about it<br/>
<br/>
