Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ey-oh<br/>
Hey-oh, hey, that hey-oh, hey-oh, hey<br/>
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)<br/>
Hey-oh (Alright)<br/>
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey (Alright, let's go)<br/>
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)<br/>
<br/>
East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this<br/>
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this<br/>
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this<br/>
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights<br/>
No lights, all for this<br/>
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside, no ride in the wintertime all for this<br/>
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank<br/>
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this<br/>
Tell me what you know about family never there but swear they deserve all of this<br/>
Tell me what you know about people tryna test you<br/>
Don't wanna get involved with this<br/>
X you out, you get solved with this<br/>
Never, but I gotta evolve with this<br/>
Like bitch I bet I be at the place I said I'd be<br/>
Legendary like No I.D<br/>
You know I be duckin' every ho I see<br/>
Cause I'm out of this world, and I know I be like...<br/>
<br/>
East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this<br/>
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this<br/>
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this<br/>
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this<br/>
<br/>
Living as a black man, in the skin of the white man<br/>
Everybody wanna fight man, and I put it on my right hand<br/>
Goddamn, it's all for this<br/>
I just wanna make the world a better place<br/>
Fuck race and the shade in my face<br/>
Looking for the sun but the shade in my face<br/>
Best in my field, I'm a slave to the race<br/>
Black motherfucker, white motherfucker<br/>
I don't give a damn what you is, can you write motherfucker?<br/>
Said I couldn't do it, said I wouldn't do it<br/>
I just made a million in a month, aight motherfucker?<br/>
I did everything I said I'd ever do and to you I still ain't shit?<br/>
Alright motherfucker<br/>
Runnin' around the world yelling P-L-P<br/>
But as a last resort, we gon' fight motherfucker like<br/>
<br/>
East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this<br/>
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this<br/>
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this<br/>
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this
