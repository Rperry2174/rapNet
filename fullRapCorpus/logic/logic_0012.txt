<i>[Logic - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Somebody let me know right now..<br/>
Cause honestly I don't know right now..<br/>
And I could be high right now..<br/>
But I still feel low somehow..<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever feel, like you don't even know?<br/>
Which direction you should go?<br/>
If so homie, take it slow,<br/>
Pop a bottle with some dro,<br/>
Let all of your worries go<br/>
-Consume yourself within this flow..<br/>
<br/>
Whether your girl is actin' up,<br/>
Or your man was cheating on you,<br/>
Or you can't pay your bills<br/>
-and you can't take it no mo'<br/>
Or somebody done passed away,<br/>
Be strong and live another day..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic - Hook]</i><br/>
I said, I just wanna smoke,<br/>
I just wanna drink,<br/>
There's so much on my mind that I don't even wanna think<br/>
<i>[X4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic - Verse 2]</i><br/>
This is Shakespeare's mind state,<br/>
808 and heartbreak,<br/>
They feelin' so alone,<br/>
Can someone relate to their heart sake?<br/>
Used to walk into the room,<br/>
And that would make their heart race,<br/>
But you ain't seen that person for some time,<br/>
And now your heart aches<br/>
<br/>
Now do you even know,<br/>
Where you really wanna go?<br/>
You been down that street befo',<br/>
Maybe you should take it slow,<br/>
Think about the life you livin',<br/>
But don't think so hard it hurts,<br/>
Life is truly a gift,<br/>
But at the same it is a curse<br/>
<br/>
Now, you gotta persevere,<br/>
Get over any fear,<br/>
You let go of the wheel,<br/>
But I think now it's time to steer,<br/>
So show em that you ready,<br/>
And show em that you strong,<br/>
But not tonight cause you gon' get your good time on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic - Hook]</i><br/>
I said, I just wanna smoke,<br/>
I just wanna drink,<br/>
There's so much on my mind that I don't even wanna think<br/>
