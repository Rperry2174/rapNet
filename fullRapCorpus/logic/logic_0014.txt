<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Only last week I murdered a rock, injured a stone<br/>
Hospitalized a brick, I'm so mean I make medicine sick<br/>
<br/>
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic<br/>
Yeah my name is, yeah my name is Logic and I'm in the fucking building<br/>
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic<br/>
Yeah my name is, yeah my name is Logic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
(Give it to me) Like I want it, I need it<br/>
Gotta have it, can't live without it<br/>
(I'm a give it to you) Like you want it, you need it<br/>
Gotta have it, can't live without it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
O.K. I'm a give it to you like you never had, get you glad<br/>
Crucify that pussy, yeah your boy is bad (Boy is bad)<br/>
If you want it now then girl let's get it popping<br/>
Panties dropping, Fuck your man<br/>
Now or never shorty, we ain't never stopping<br/>
So use your logic, mama you won't get this chance again<br/>
Take you to the moon just to watch the fucking world spin<br/>
Yes I'm living right, but tonight I'm in a world of sin<br/>
Try to focus on this music but here comes that girl again<br/>
Love the way she talk, the way she walk, the way her curls spin<br/>
And every time she talk to me I feel the need for oxygen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah my name is Logic and I'm in the fucking building<br/>
Searching for the shorty that is down to have my children<br/>
Break a genetic code that allows my DNA to fill him<br/>
Blood money all I know so you can say I make a killin<br/>
When I'm in your presence, my intellect what surrounds you<br/>
But we can dumb it down, no need for words, let me astound you<br/>
Take a sip of water, smoke a jack, it's time for round 2<br/>
I beat the pussy up, like I want your lunch money<br/>
Give you the quick-stick, like fifth-gear, honey<br/>
I don't prefer beef, that just isn't my agenda<br/>
I'd rather eat beets, like a thursday in november<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic<br/>
Yeah my name is, yeah my name is Logic and I'm in the fucking building<br/>
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic<br/>
Yeah my name is, yeah my name is Logic, you can say I make a killin'<br/>
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic<br/>
Yeah my name is, yeah my name is Logic and I'm in the fucking building<br/>
Yeah my name is Logic, yeah my name is Logic<br/>
Yeah my name is, yeah my name is Logic, you can say I make a killin'
