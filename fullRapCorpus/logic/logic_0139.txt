<i>[Lucy Rose:]</i><br/>
Everything is fine, everything is so fine<br/>
Everything is fine, everything is so fine<br/>
'Cause I'm good, so good<br/>
'Cause I'm good, so good, so good<br/>
I wish you would, I wish you would<br/>
I wish you would, I wish you would<br/>
I wish you would, this is my life<br/>
This is my all, this is my all<br/>
And now I'm happy, right now I'm happy, but sometimes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
I'ma get up in your mind right now<br/>
I'ma get up in your, I'ma get it<br/>
Gon' get up, gon' get up<br/>
Gon' get up, get up, get up, get up<br/>
I'ma get up in your mind right now<br/>
Make you feel like dying right now<br/>
I'ma make you pray to God<br/>
To the good old Lord for a sign right now<br/>
To the good old Lord<br/>
I'ma get up in your mind right now<br/>
Make you feel like dying right now<br/>
I'ma make you pray to God<br/>
To the good old Lord for a sign right now<br/>
To the good old Lord<br/>
<br/>
"I'ma make it some day some how" what you telling yourself<br/>
But you ain't focused on what's important: mentality, health Everybody in the world only want one thing, what's that?<br/>
Infinite power and a pocket full of wealth<br/>
Its like ohhh I'ma bring it back to the basics<br/>
Nobody can erase it<br/>
People in the street going ape shit<br/>
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit<br/>
I'ma bring it back to the basics<br/>
I'ma bring it back to the basics<br/>
I'ma get up, get on<br/>
That's what I been on<br/>
Fuckin' with your mind, tryna turn shit on<br/>
But they want to paint me as a villain<br/>
Even though I'm here to open their mind<br/>
Through the rhyme of life<br/>
I gotta open their mind and design the right time<br/>
To make a decision and get in 'em like an incision<br/>
'Cause I'ma hit 'em and give 'em livin'<br/>
They wonder what I'm giving, I'ma never give in<br/>
I gotta let everybody know<br/>
I'm in their mind right now<br/>
<br/>
I'ma get up in your mind right now<br/>
Make you feel like dying right now<br/>
I'ma make you pray to God<br/>
To the good old Lord for a sign right now<br/>
To the good old Lord<br/>
I'ma get up in your mind right now<br/>
Make you feel like dying right now<br/>
I'ma make you pray to God<br/>
To the good old Lord for a sign right now<br/>
To the good old Lord<br/>
<br/>
I'ma bring it back to the basics<br/>
Nobody can erase it<br/>
People in the street going ape shit<br/>
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit<br/>
Why nobody wanna say:<br/>
I been living with this everyday<br/>
Why nobody wanna say:<br/>
Everything will be ok<br/>
I'ma bring it back to the basics<br/>
Everything will be okay<br/>
I remember somehow, someway<br/>
I remember somehow, someway<br/>
I remember somehow, someway<br/>
I remember somehow, someway<br/>
<br/>
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood<br/>
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars<br/>
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic<br/>
As my body began to fade<br/>
In this moment my mind was full of clarity<br/>
But my body insisted it was in danger<br/>
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine<br/>
But I was convinced that something was wrong<br/>
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to<br/>
Fall and fade away<br/>
My body grew weak<br/>
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety<br/>
I refused to believe this story<br/>
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me<br/>
I began to feel detached from reality<br/>
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass<br/>
I got blood work done<br/>
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail<br/>
The doctor said it was anxiety<br/>
But how could it be anxiety?<br/>
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?<br/>
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?<br/>
Derealization<br/>
The sense of being out of one's body<br/>
I'm not here<br/>
I'm not me<br/>
I'm not real<br/>
Nothing is<br/>
Nothing but this feeling of panic<br/>
Nobody understands<br/>
Nobody knows the sufferings<br/>
This physical feeling<br/>
It can't be anxiety<br/>
It can't<br/>
Or can it?<br/>
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?<br/>
Yeah, of course<br/>
I'm so in control of my mind and my body<br/>
But I'm subconsciously forcing myself into a state<br/>
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind<br/>
I am unhappy<br/>
Not with life<br/>
But with this feeling<br/>
I am scared, I am human, I am a man<br/>
But I look in the mirror and I see a child<br/>
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don't really know shit<br/>
And they never did<br/>
And it scares me<br/>
Cause now I'm just a grown up who doesn't know shit<br/>
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me<br/>
No, no this feeling<br/>
This anxiety is nothing<br/>
I have anxiety<br/>
Just like you, the person I wrote this for<br/>
And together we will overcome this feeling<br/>
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge<br/>
That we are alive<br/>
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted<br/>
We will rejoice in this gift that is life<br/>
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given<br/>
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves<br/>
Starting with mental health<br/>
We will accept ourselves as we are<br/>
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror<br/>
We will accept ourselves<br/>
And live with anxiety
