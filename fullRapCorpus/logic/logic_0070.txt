<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Multi-million dollar deals, got a million dollar deal<br/>
When I was younger, I would wonder how a million dollars feel<br/>
And forreal, it feel like I ain't even broke a seal<br/>
Cause when you drop hits they want you to pick up the bill<br/>
Now my, life is in Maryland, my heart is in Chicago<br/>
New York state of mind but out LA man that's where I go<br/>
When I need to lay this shit down<br/>
So much on my mind that's the reason I'm spittin' now<br/>
Finally running the game and everybody trippin' now<br/>
But I can't give a damn I got they bitches drippin' now<br/>
Moet we sippin now, yeah we came a long way<br/>
I know a lot of people thought they'd never see the day<br/>
That we get big like Notorious, cause we battle like warriors<br/>
In the state of euphoria, my team is so fucking glorious<br/>
So I'm a love life while you live life<br/>
Cause I ain't perfect but I do my best to live it right, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Are you... ready to go<br/>
I know the city getting ready for me<br/>
I know the city getting ready<br/>
Are you... ready to go<br/>
I know the city getting ready for me<br/>
I know the city getting ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I should have took the time to understand the world<br/>
But I was just too busy tryna understand them girls<br/>
I never told anyone but I asked my ex to marry me<br/>
A couple months later the bitch buried me<br/>
And I know what y'all thinking<br/>
"Logic, there's still hope, keep yo chin up mothafucka, ain't no reason to mope<br/>
Plus you got a lot of money and your music is dope"<br/>
What's all the money in the world if yo heart still broke?<br/>
But let's get back to the subject cause I was all for the topic<br/>
Hand me the mic and I rock it, they say they hate it then jock it, shit<br/>
I remember no heat in the winter time<br/>
Now that I'm eating haters griling me like dinner time<br/>
Tryna make a living off of what we've been giving<br/>
Since a youngin' I've been driven, just tryna do it how I do it, huh?<br/>
From my city, to your city, to Chi city<br/>
We blowing up at high velocity, wadddup<br/>
<br/>
