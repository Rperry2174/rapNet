<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Dear God, I think it's time we had a conversation<br/>
These lonely nights is getting to me so my mind is racing<br/>
I think about this life I live and all the shit I'm facing<br/>
More secrets in my mind then a free mason<br/>
I get lonely at times, and then I write these rhymes<br/>
I'm only human, I want to hit the club and fuck a dime<br/>
But I know that's not the answer to my problems<br/>
Lord help me solve them<br/>
Disintegrate and dissolve them<br/>
Laying in bed<br/>
With a girl I'm pretty sure is my next<br/>
Contemplating the sex<br/>
While I think about my ex<br/>
Am I wrong, Dear God, am I wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Dear God tell me am I wrong<br/>
For living the life of a king surrounded by these pawns<br/>
Fans telling me I'm the greatest but I never hear them<br/>
Cause I ain't hit the pinnacle yeah I'm still persevering<br/>
Demons whispering in my ear but no I never fear them<br/>
People thinking they on his level they ain't even near him<br/>
I just want to spread positivity<br/>
Through lyrical ability<br/>
They call it selling out but I just call it versatility<br/>
Yeah, it's my life<br/>
My wrongs, and My rights<br/>
My battle, My songs, and My fights<br/>
Now everybody want to come around<br/>
Tell me where was you last year when a brother was down<br/>
Not a single one of you mother fuckers believed in the brand<br/>
Extended a hand<br/>
And now you want to be my man<br/>
I think not<br/>
You quick to shape shift like ink blots<br/>
The real dealer we cut classic no fitters<br/>
What about the time<br/>
I was nine<br/>
And my mama almost murdered me<br/>
Don't think I forgot that shit it still burdens me<br/>
Her bare hands tight around my throat I can't breath I screamed I can't breath mama<br/>
Don't you want me mama<br/>
Don't you love me mama<br/>
What the fuck<br/>
Where was you here God tell me now<br/>
Hows a brother supposed to stay sane tell me how<br/>
Why you let me live but let another die<br/>
Why you dry my tears but let another cry<br/>
Gotta know<br/>
Set to detonate I gotta blow<br/>
That shit for show<br/>
I used to wonder why in the hell you would make me suffer<br/>
But now in the end I understand that it made me tougher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: x2]</i><br/>
I get up when I'm down<br/>
Had enough almost drowned<br/>
When shit rough<br/>
I get tough<br/>
And when I'm beaten to the ground I get up
