<i>[Woman Singing]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
"I love her smile, I love her hair, I love her teeth. I love this heart-shaped birthmark she has on her neck. I love the way she sometimes, licks her lips before she talks. I love the sound of her laugh"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I can feel it now<br/>
It's coming soon<br/>
It is my world, my sun and moon<br/>
Once upon a time, this world was love<br/>
But now I know this is everything that I've dreamed of<br/>
So take it slow<br/>
Speed it up<br/>
Every time I see you I just want to beat it up<br/>
Maybe not, but that's a lie<br/>
C'mon baby girl, ain't no need to cry<br/>
Just let me go, or let me know<br/>
Why the hell you wanna stick around fo'<br/>
Arms length<br/>
Just so you do, don't get to close, that is the rule<br/>
I remember when I met her back in high school<br/>
Science class, sitting on the stool<br/>
Now I'm feeling like a fool<br/>
Cause I cut that tie months ago, this girl is cruel<br/>
Maybe not, just very lovely<br/>
No matter what she says I know she still loves me<br/>
So can I love?<br/>
I've already asked<br/>
Who would've know matters of the heart would be such a task?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
"I hate summer, I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. I hate the way she sounds when she laughs"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Uh, She used to be my girl<br/>
But now she just a girl I'm fucking<br/>
She used to mean the world to me but now that world is nothing<br/>
I would've put a ring on that finger but I couldn't afford it<br/>
So I laced it with rib and she adored it<br/>
Uh, sometimes I wonder if she thinks of me<br/>
But my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively<br/>
How could the pussy be that good?<br/>
Cause my feelings involved<br/>
Till my shorty evolved<br/>
And her feelings dissolved<br/>
But that's what happens when you find them young<br/>
Treat them like royalty, and they will run<br/>
Searching the world for perfect love and realize you're the one<br/>
But they fucked because that shit is done<br/>
This is a letter to the woman of my dreams<br/>
Love what she brings<br/>
So listen baby girl cause everything ain't what it seems<br/>
You either know me now<br/>
Or I'm a meet you after fame<br/>
But one thing's for sure<br/>
Your life will never be the same<br/>
Cause you're gonna be my wife and my mistress<br/>
So understand now I can't be there for every Christmas<br/>
I love you more than anything, but I could never risk this<br/>
On stage living life, while you're forced to miss this
