<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
Life of a don, chain just glowin'<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
Life of a don, chain just glowin'<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Yeah, me and my team used to dream about<br/>
The future but now we be rollin' everywhere we goin'<br/>
Our cards never showin' the moment I'm flowin' we livin' it right now<br/>
Long way from the ghetto, pull strings like Gepetto<br/>
Poppin' that fine wine, look at the way my chain shine<br/>
Soon as I change my state of mind, from a lazy ass boy<br/>
To a man that's on his grind so answer my question<br/>
Did I even mention? The fact that I'm livin' the life that I wanted<br/>
I keep a hunnid, got cash in abundance, that's bills by the hunnid<br/>
I've said it and done it, you know that I run it while everyone else<br/>
Say it, then plummit now, yeah you know I run it now<br/>
While the whole world wonder how<br/>
My chain shine nice<br/>
But I am not defined by the money, not defined by the ice<br/>
What defines me. Let me tell you what defines me<br/>
Is the heart and the effort I give in every letter in which I write for you<br/>
And if you ignorant closed minded motherfuckers do not like it<br/>
It's not right for you. No, it's not right for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
Life of a don, chain just glowin'<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
Life of a don, chain just glowin'<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on<br/>
<br/>
I'm swimming in women like Young Sinatra 1 &amp; 2<br/>
With the RattPack on my back there's really no telling what we finna do<br/>
If a shorty in my eye, then yes baby girl I be coming for you<br/>
Nice cars, nice clothes, hotel suites after the shows<br/>
So simplistic, never materialistic, but we do like compliments<br/>
Why, because theses diamonds are accomplishments<br/>
Food stamps, welfare, medicare and section 8 to<br/>
Loui V, smoking tree, and steak up on my dinner plate<br/>
And you wonder why us rappers floss... because for once<br/>
We can finally afford the cost<br/>
I once was the worker, now I'm the boss<br/>
See my chain is an accomplishment. I call these diamonds milestones<br/>
It's hard call for help with no dial tone<br/>
But, now I'm buying whips with no motherfucking miles on em'<br/>
But I don't blow my money, I give it back to people<br/>
Why these rappers spend money on blowing, stop acting equal<br/>
But I've been real since the fucking prequel<br/>
So the next time you that you looking at my chain<br/>
What you really see is 23 long years of pain<br/>
With nothing to loose and everything to gain<br/>
Cause the world is divided, but we are the same<br/>
And I'm getting that money, cause bitches they love me<br/>
And this is the life I'm live, ain't it funny but<br/>
I'm a keep rising, til ya'll realizing, that so much is waiting over the horizon<br/>
Cause I've seen the days and yes also the night<br/>
So that means I've seen the darkness as well as the light<br/>
And that's the very same light<br/>
That's the very same light, that let's my chain shine bright<br/>
Said that's the very same light, that let my chain shine bright<br/>
Soooooo...<br/>
<br/>

My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
Life of a don, chain just glowin'<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
Life of a don, chain just glowin'<br/>
My chain, my chain<br/>
Don't you like my chain, mayne?<br/>
I'm coming in the club with that fresh shit on
