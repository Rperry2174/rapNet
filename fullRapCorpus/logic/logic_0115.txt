Me and my team gotta intervene<br/>
What's the point of livin' if you ain't livin' a dream?<br/>
We live in a world where everybody want everything<br/>
Everybody want a better thing<br/>
Tryna feel ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing<br/>
Man, the game been waiting for a better king<br/>
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King<br/>
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't<br/>
Man, I never knew livin' out a dream meant livin' out a suitcase<br/>
I've been working at a new pace<br/>
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute<br/>
Not a single second chilling in my new place<br/>
Motherfuckers getting two-faced<br/>
Cause a brother finally eating<br/>
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates<br/>
You know I only got two traits<br/>
Drop hits, get money<br/>
Run it<br/>
<br/>
What the fuck is there left to talk about<br/>
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about<br/>
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out<br/>
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out<br/>
And that's the reason why I've been in the kitchen<br/>
Working on that nutrition<br/>
I let em listen, boy this been my house<br/>
This is merely an addiction, fuck 'em and their permission<br/>
They was killin' the game, who the one that gave 'em remission?<br/>
You know the name<br/>
Who else you know wanna come up, do it like I does it<br/>
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it<br/>
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?<br/>
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it<br/>
I was workin' on a budget<br/>
Second time around shit is different cuh they know that boy good, know he does it<br/>
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit<br/>
Not the people that been hating, they can suck my dick<br/>
Run it<br/>
<br/>
I'm a do somethin' different for the last one<br/>
I'm a go in<br/>
<br/>
Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey on a Interstellar mission in Chicago at the bottom of the Riviera<br/>
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era<br/>
I got a berretta for people but I take care of the people when I jump in the cockpit and rock it<br/>
Been done, had this in my pocket<br/>
I had to wait to unlock it<br/>
Open that locket and see the picture I painted<br/>
No we ain't never aquainted<br/>
On the rise, look at defending<br/>
Now we trial for possession like an exorcism<br/>
My division is solely my vision, God damn<br/>
Can you feel it? Uh<br/>
I had a dream I would run the game and kill it<br/>
Had a dream, can you feel it?<br/>
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit<br/>
Get up in it, make the shit infinite<br/>
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent<br/>
I've been at it like an addict<br/>
Never at the party like I'm democratic<br/>
'Lotta static on the radio<br/>
Fuck everything that they represent<br/>
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant<br/>
No never when I slide up in the spot, just a youngin' in the game<br/>
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back<br/>
That was the mentality, never truly reality<br/>
Looking for validation<br/>
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation<br/>
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation<br/>
Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation<br/>
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up<br/>
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up<br/>
Man it's been a good ride up<br/>
Everybody want me to lace 'em, I'm too tied up<br/>
This a ransom<br/>
Fist full of money then we had back to the mansion<br/>
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding<br/>
Couple years back you ain't give a damn<br/>
Autographs off the plane whenever I land<br/>
All part of the plan<br/>
And anything you wanna do you can<br/>
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em<br/>
Be above it 'less you're thinking your profession gon' be rap<br/>
Matter fact you should take a step back<br/>
Cause I run it
