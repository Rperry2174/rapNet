I know that you think this song is for you<br/>
I used to long for you and adore you<br/>
My life was just fine way back before you<br/>
Now when you reach out I just ignore you<br/>
Cause this ain't a love song<br/>
This is "So long"<br/>
You did me so wrong for so long, for so long<br/>
No I never thought I could live my life without you<br/>
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you<br/>
And so I doubt you<br/>
I doubt you even know what's on my mind<br/>
I said I doubt you<br/>
I doubt you even know why I left you behind<br/>
I know that I've been living<br/>
I know that I've been living<br/>
I know that I've been living<br/>
I know that I've been living<br/>
In the city of stars<br/>
Where there's flying cars<br/>
A brand new home for everyone<br/>
And even life on Mars<br/>
In the city of stars<br/>
Where there's flying cars<br/>
A brand new home for everyone<br/>
And even life on Mars<br/>
In the city...<br/>
Cause this ain't a love song<br/>
This is "So long"<br/>
You did me so wrong for so long, for so long<br/>
And so I doubt you<br/>
I doubt you even know what's on my mind<br/>
I said I doubt you<br/>
I doubt you even know how I let you...<br/>
<br/>
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me<br/>
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me<br/>
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me<br/>
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me<br/>
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album<br/>
But black vs white bullshit was the still the outcome<br/>
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go<br/>
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow<br/>
Who gives a fuck who made it, I penetrated and innovated<br/>
While they emulated, give a fuck if I'm hated<br/>
I'mma do it til I get it, fuck a nominated<br/>
Bitch I dominate it<br/>
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID<br/>
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E<br/>
Not many get to what I do, and now enemies<br/>
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me<br/>
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone<br/>
Outside of this solar system I'm searching for paradise<br/>
Livin' the life, bitch I've been a vet<br/>
Fuck all these cats on the internet<br/>
I love Hip Hop and I hate Hip Hop<br/>
Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot<br/>
Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sake<br/>
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break<br/>
Now I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game<br/>
We all people, all equal<br/>
Now let me let off, yeah<br/>
Now let me let off<br/>
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify<br/>
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by<br/>
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones<br/>
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone<br/>
Switch flows, fuck 'em up<br/>
Play the game, run 'em up<br/>
Yeah I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck<br/>
All the people want is real<br/>
Guess that's why Logic appeal<br/>
All the power in the world, hold that, tell me how it feel<br/>
Racism on television and in magazines<br/>
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn<br/>
Country don't give a fuck who I am<br/>
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand<br/>
And I am, here's to the Roc<br/>
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop, shot<br/>
And I am finally on top<br/>
Too high up, not a drop<br/>
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap<br/>
I am livin' like I ain't got it<br/>
Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it<br/>
Maryland 'til I die but I had to get the fuck up out it<br/>
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know man, I doubt it
