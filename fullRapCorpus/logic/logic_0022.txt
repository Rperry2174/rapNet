<i>[Frank Sinatra:]</i><br/>
When I was 21<br/>
It was a very good year<br/>
It was a very good year<br/>
For city girls<br/>
Who lived up the stairs<br/>
With all that perfumed hair<br/>
And it came undone<br/>
When I was 21<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
It was all a dream just a year ago<br/>
Bussin' tables and servin' food but ya'll don't hear it though<br/>
Now I'm on another level but ya'll aren't near it though<br/>
My soul bleedin' on the track, so spiritual<br/>
It's a blessing cause now rappin' is my profession yo<br/>
Set to detonate, I'm just waitin' for my time to blow<br/>
White boy at first glance but when I ryhme they know<br/>
Race don't mean a fucking thing the second that I flow<br/>
It's been a year and everything I said would happened has<br/>
While everybody that I know is out havin' a blast<br/>
I was right here in the studio bustin' my ass<br/>
It's been a year I'm 21 but I feel (35)<br/>
And now I got this<br/>
I taste the blood, no one can stop this<br/>
Second I drop this, die hard fans is finna cop this<br/>
While the rest of the world follows through fiber optics<br/>
I took my time, see I studied the game, learned how to rhyme<br/>
I was around drugs and gats, but never delved in crime<br/>
Had other things in mind, so I began to grind<br/>
First tape was a success<br/>
Locally, I got press<br/>
But I knew this one right here would run the world a mess, but I digress<br/>
A year ago, I was a young'un in his room<br/>
Staring out the window, lookin at the moon, knowing it's coming soon<br/>
But today I bought this rocket ship and sonic boom<br/>
Cause I am no longer a seed, homie, it's time to bloom
