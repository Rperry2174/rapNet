<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go<br/>
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go<br/>
(Hey!) Are you ready to go? Ready to go<br/>
Everybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go? Ready to go<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
On my Charlie Sheen, homie, yes I am a winner<br/>
And when it comes to making music, I am no beginner<br/>
Hit the stage and get wild, my braniac's loud<br/>
Call me 007 because I bond with the crowd<br/>
You shine like a star but I sun it<br/>
50 keep it a 100, homie you know I run it<br/>
The game needs change and Logic can break a 100<br/>
I had a shorty to bun it, until she didn't want it<br/>
So I focused on the flow and they gon' put me on the map<br/>
With a pocket full of change, every day a different dime<br/>
Only fuck with golden girls and I ain't talking Lifetime<br/>
When I rhyme they up on me cause they seen how I'm a shine<br/>
Now you may be wondering how my raps rock<br/>
Cause I'm so fifth key to the right of Caps Lock<br/>
And when my tracks drop I'm a be sipping Ciroc<br/>
With a whole skyline chilling in the backdrop<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Phil Ade]</i><br/>
Shit, nigga I was born ready<br/>
And I swear I'm what these rappers can't bear, warn teddy<br/>
My Pro Tools bouncing like a '64 Chevy<br/>
I'm trying to win fast y'all on that Eddie<br/>
Plus Carl and Harriet, G is how I carry it<br/>
Been in it for miles, don't believe ask Darius<br/>
Running this beach like Chariots of Fire<br/>
I aspire to be higher than these superficial liars<br/>
The attire I acquire cost a grip, buy your pliers<br/>
I'm a ball out and die in Maryland, Len Bias<br/>
Apply a sire to my name, yeah Normoyle<br/>
I foil from slick talk, yeah trip of that oil<br/>
Toying with girls feelings, lord forgive me I need healing<br/>
I know you said it's wrong but a long would make a killing<br/>
Hit the bong I hit the ceiling, hit the drink I hit the floor<br/>
If they show 'em in the villain to the crowd then let me know<br/>
