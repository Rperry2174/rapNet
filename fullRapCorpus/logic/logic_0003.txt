Going so you know I'm trying to get it<br/>
Eyes on the prize like I really want to hit it<br/>
Mind on my money, money on mind like a fitted<br/>
Give me the mic and you know Imma spit it<br/>
This is hot you call me Logic rising to the top just watch it<br/>
Now I'm in the rap game but this still the same<br/>
Got to grind, bring fame to my name<br/>
Wake up go to work come home write<br/>
I'd rather be rapping on stage every night<br/>
Perfecting that craft and getting it right<br/>
Solo? No I think that's tight<br/>
I've been waiting in line at the D.M.V<br/>
But now it's time that you've heard of me<br/>
Cutting lines they want to murder me<br/>
Cause I'm rising to the top quickly<br/>
I'm so ill they sick of me<br/>
Said I'm so ill they sick of me<br/>
My etiquette sick, predicate sick<br/>
So infectious I make medicine sick<br/>
I got it on lock, will never stop<br/>
Got y'all addicted like Rick is to rock<br/>
I'm ready to bang, doing my thing<br/>
Y'all Tyrone Biggums, my music the cane<br/>
Taking over the game<br/>
With each and every set<br/>
Your career is in jeopardy and I'm Alex Trebek<br/>
I'll drop a track that'll murder your whole camp for fun<br/>
I'm young Elroy, fly like a jet, son<br/>
<br/>
Live with the mic I grip it<br/>
Man I dare you to try to come pick it<br/>
Always on point so you never gon' get it<br/>
Got rhymes for days the flow infinite<br/>
I, kill the club when I'm in it<br/>
Rocking the game I am cemented<br/>
I produce the real, they counterfeit it<br/>
Setting it off like Jada Pinkett<br/>
Yeah my, lyrics is hot but the flow hydrate you like liquid<br/>
If y'all hands in the vault I'll flip it<br/>
Y'all gon' need jars in the game, never sip it<br/>
Got it on lock when I walk with you shippin'<br/>
Yeah I got shoes to fill but I can fit 'em<br/>
Call me the master socks and I drill'em (drill'em)<br/>
Full Metal Jacket I kill'em (kill'em)<br/>
I'm secured like A.D.T<br/>
Y'all distracted like A.D.D<br/>
Y'all ain't touching my self esteem I hold keys like Mediene<br/>
Young thriller I'mma beat'em<br/>
Haters know I don't need'em<br/>
Cause Logic get nasty, on my Jeffrey Dahmer I eat 'em<br/>
Go back and check a second time<br/>
Be sure and frisk it<br/>
So many hot lines encrypted you probably just missed it<br/>
I flow narcissistic and keep a mirror in your booth<br/>
Even I can't believe I'm saying this shit I needed proof
