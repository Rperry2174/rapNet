<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm a get it right now and never will I give up<br/>
Homie this is food for thought you better fill up<br/>
I'm coming in strong with a song for very long<br/>
So I gotta make you understand before the beat is gone<br/>
Homie you are not alone, we are in the zone<br/>
We are in the matrix full of that fake shit<br/>
Make you wanna grab the gat and go ape shit<br/>
Living in a world of lies I can't take it<br/>
Needed someone to save me, Needed someone to hug me<br/>
Needed a whole world but nobody would love me<br/>
'Had I learned from this that people wanna buck me<br/>
Had I learned from this that people wanna buck me'<br/>
I said I can't take it I know I'm gonna make it<br/>
I know I'm not normal but I gotta fake it<br/>
I swear I'm not cocky, I am just confident<br/>
That when I step On the stage I am dominant and now I am beggin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Beggin, Beggin You<br/>
Put yo' Loving Hand Out baby<br/>
Beggin, Beggin You<br/>
Put yo' Loving Hand Out Darling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]</i><br/>
Sick of living in the dark so I'm begging for the light<br/>
Feeling like I'm in a fight every single time a write<br/>
Cus I gotta make sure that they hear me right<br/>
Told me that I couldn't do it so when I pick up the mic<br/>
I gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it<br/>
They can feel what's in my soul<br/>
Lyrical cocaine yeah homie I got a blow<br/>
But first they gotta know who I is<br/>
So I'm begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big<br/>
Cus I ain't new to this I'm true to this<br/>
Thinking I'm a stand up and roll out Homie that's ludacris<br/>
Not here to play no games, I'm here to stay and make a change<br/>
And mate your ways so I remain<br/>
I'm in the studio for days and days<br/>
Spittin' out these razorblades, don't wanna place no blame<br/>
But without you I couldn't get to where I'm headding<br/>
So to everybody I'm begging<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Beggin, Beggin You<br/>
Put yo' Loving Hand Out baby<br/>
Beggin, Beggin You<br/>
Put yo' Loving Hand Out Darling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah, Yeah, I said this is my path don't mess with me<br/>
I didn't choose this life it was destiny<br/>
God tested me to find the best of me<br/>
And I know I'm going to make it even without a degree<br/>
Cus the test scores don't mean shit to me<br/>
And when you said that I would fail it didn't get to me<br/>
Now I'm begging, public masses, please<br/>
I'm way to proud to get down on my knees<br/>
But I'm begging, on another level<br/>
Fuck Illuminati that's word to the devil<br/>
Cus I am not about that I just wanna love<br/>
I just wanna grow, I just wanna learn<br/>
The pass and the verbs to write this music<br/>
I'm so late that I just might lose it<br/>
But don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it<br/>
I just wanna help it but not hurt it<br/>
And as for my style I don't know how to word it<br/>
Why do you even have to catergorize me?<br/>
Fuckin' let em hate, let 'em all despise me<br/>
Cus I'm gonna take this, fill it up and make this<br/>
Something that the whole word cannot imagine<br/>
Let alone fathom I'm from another planet<br/>
I swear I'm not mathic, listen to me dammit<br/>
My future's in your hands and so I'm beggin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Beggin, Beggin You<br/>
Put yo' Loving Hand Out baby<br/>
Beggin, Beggin You<br/>
Put yo' Loving Hand Out Darling
