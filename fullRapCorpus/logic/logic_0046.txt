<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Dead Presidents III, Not to be confused with Growing Pains III<br/>
Logic this logic that, Logic sick, Logic wack<br/>
Logic just don't give a fuck, RATTPACK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease<br/>
Got-a-ca-peashe this is my house you fuckers just lease<br/>
Waitin' on a record deal that's never cumming like a priest<br/>
Black and white like a nun<br/>
These up-and-comers our sun<br/>
Like the break of dawn<br/>
So follow your father like an apostle paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil<br/>
Never knowin what's gon follow<br/>
However we never wallow in our sorrow<br/>
Just pray for tomorrow<br/>
At times my heart could be hallow<br/>
Emotions forced to be swallowed<br/>
While neighborhood cats blast star gas like the apollo<br/>
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder<br/>
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you so I'm trying to find her<br/>
One moment she'll love you then swallow you whole like an anaconda<br/>
The bitch is kinky, kind of<br/>
So with the lift of a pinky I'm a<br/>
Dominate the world like my name is brain<br/>
Spit flame like propane<br/>
Bitches I overcame you know the name<br/>
Ink in my veins, inflames, and spew on the page, to numb the pain like Novocain, mutha fucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm out the presidents to represent me (get money) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Allow me to kill it off the brink like no traffic<br/>
Murderin' every demographic<br/>
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic<br/>
Rip the mic to set the example<br/>
While all these mu-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples<br/>
Constant thoughts of suicide, where living in an area that's do or die<br/>
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I<br/>
But we persevere force fear enemies truse saying "we want nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased"<br/>
In your central nervous system like heroine reppin' maryland to the fullest<br/>
Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers that are ignited by triggers don't pull it<br/>
I go from point A to point B by keeping it G<br/>
Ain't no killer but don't push me<br/>
If you grab the heat you a pussy<br/>
Buckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steal<br/>
I have not a single enemy<br/>
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, In they mind<br/>
Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme<br/>
And when it comes to dame's I catch plane's<br/>
They catch feelins<br/>
Haters keep my name in they mouth like villains<br/>
High as a cellin<br/>
Ya'll really don't know who your dealing with now<br/>
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen<br/>
I'm thankful for every breath I'm givin<br/>
Fuck social division<br/>
On the road to success and their ain't no time for collision<br/>
People ask "how you get your flow so amazing"<br/>
To which I reply "I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions"<br/>
Haters taken shots but I never graze em<br/>
Now if pro is the opposite of con<br/>
What's the opposite of pro-gress<br/>
I love my country but that shit a mess<br/>
Grew up on sex and they that I can attest<br/>
And how they wonder why I claim I'm the fucking best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm out the presidents to represent me (get money) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
Now if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it<br/>
Now run it back and retrieve it<br/>
Till you receive it in your mother fuckin mind<br/>
Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99<br/>
Back in 1999 that's when I began to rhyme<br/>
Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine<br/>
Daddy was smokin crack I was raised by a single mom<br/>
Fastin every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan<br/>
I was poor as fuck me and my momma didn't have a dime<br/>
At 16 the school system dismissed him and wished him well<br/>
But my momma never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?<br/>
So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own<br/>
I left home at 17<br/>
Shortly after my momma got stabbed by fucking around in the streets<br/>
But she still breathin which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving<br/>
So many rappers biting me you would think they was teethin<br/>
So you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story
