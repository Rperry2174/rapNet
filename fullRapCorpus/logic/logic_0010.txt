<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
(Allllllright)<br/>
In the sky it's a bird, it's a plane, nah who dat?<br/>
Everybody want me to save them, I can't do that<br/>
Gotta little shine and they wonder where the lewd at<br/>
The life of an artist I had to pursue that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Superman all the time yea, true dat<br/>
That's why I laugh when they ask, "Man where the suit at?"<br/>
I love my family love my friends<br/>
But when it comes down to money see it all depends<br/>
<br/>
Cause now I got new family, I got new friends<br/>
That I never even seen before, where does it end?<br/>
See I got loved ones and I got enemies<br/>
But at the end of the day I don't know the identities<br/>
<br/>
So they love the entities<br/>
And people befronted me for the fame<br/>
Breaking in the game<br/>
Life will never be the same...<br/>
It'll never be the same<br/>
<br/>
And they all like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You are... My...<br/>
Superhero (superhero)<br/>
I said (I said)<br/>
You are... My...<br/>
Superhero (superhero)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I was gone for a minute, came back in a flash<br/>
Spit crack up a dude's rock like dash<br/>
Any dame know I got game, go ask<br/>
This is my true identity- No mask<br/>
<br/>
Most wish to get it and rub on a flask<br/>
I wish to get it and rub on her ass<br/>
Hip-Hop what I'm talking bout, you ain't on<br/>
And a metaphor means I am hands on<br/>
<br/>
Out for the green with a buzz like Hornet<br/>
I ain't rip the game yet, I just torn it<br/>
See the good guy gets the dame<br/>
And if a shawty got a donk like Lois Lane<br/>
<br/>
I turn into the paraphilias from X-Men<br/>
You ain't get it? I'm all about the brain<br/>
Step to the mic he a beast<br/>
Hungry in the game still looking for a feast<br/>
<br/>
All about my dough on a rise like yeast<br/>
And I'm a keep going till a motha fucka deceased<br/>
See I stood on the side humbly, like Alfred<br/>
But now it's time to jump in the bat outfit<br/>
<br/>
And I could give a damn if you doubt it<br/>
Cause when I hit the stage they shout it<br/>
Uh, Yea they shout it<br/>
(What'd they shout?)<br/>
<br/>
They shout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You are... My...<br/>
Superhero (superhero)<br/>
I said (I said)<br/>
You are... My...<br/>
Superhero (superhero)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
No the flow never awkward man<br/>
Stepped in the booth the like, I'll be Damned<br/>
Kid opened his mouth and shocked me man<br/>
And I get the honeys wetter than Aqua-Man<br/>
<br/>
See that's that sex appeal<br/>
I guess that'll add another meal to the deal<br/>
But right now I'm just trying to get a meal<br/>
In the bat cave sharpen in the skill<br/>
<br/>
With an Iron-Man mindset, they can never steal<br/>
Villain on the mic though, yea I had to kill it<br/>
I wrote this rhyme in braille just for you to feel it<br/>
Let the flow pour for a minute but I gotta seal it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Hopefully now (hopefully now)<br/>
Y'all know me<br/>
Gotta grip on the game<br/>
Like it was fresh, about to sewn it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You are... My...<br/>
Superhero (superhero)<br/>
I said (I said)<br/>
You are... My...<br/>
Superhero (superhero)
