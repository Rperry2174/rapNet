People want to talk about what makes them happy<br/>
What really makes you happy?<br/>
Tell me what makes you happy<br/>
Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad<br/>
Tell me what makes you happy<br/>
People say its money, give me the money<br/>
All the money (money)<br/>
<br/>
If I could live forever and a day<br/>
Know I'd never fade away<br/>
But my life is not okay, I...<br/>
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed<br/>
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...<br/>
I wish had a lot of money<br/>
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper you already know<br/>
My life would be so much better with cheddar<br/>
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta<br/>
Cause my 9th grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit<br/>
Wouldn't be nothing<br/>
Working that minimum wage and cooking McMuffins<br/>
So I'm puffing on this green<br/>
Wishing I had more money than I do<br/>
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, aye...<br/>
And so I'm all about my business<br/>
Is there anyone who witness?<br/>
Can a brother get a witness like...<br/>
Ah-Ooh, Ah-Ooh<br/>
Wassup with it come and get it<br/>
Tell me now what's on your mind<br/>
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline<br/>
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine<br/>
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line<br/>
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society<br/>
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety<br/>
They say that money cannot make you happy<br/>
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke<br/>
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?<br/>
Why you trying me?<br/>
Like ahh...<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm a tell 'em what makes me happy<br/>
This what makes me happy, right here<br/>
Like this...<br/>
<br/>
Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP<br/>
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me<br/>
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s<br/>
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy<br/>
<br/>
This shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper, deeper than money<br/>
This shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
You know its deeper, deeper honey<br/>
This shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than your money<br/>
My money, they money, everybody money<br/>
Said, this shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
It's deeper than money<br/>
<br/>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br/>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br/>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br/>
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself<br/>
Think I need to focus more on my health<br/>
<br/>
I do, I do<br/>
This the shit that I love<br/>
This the shit that I love<br/>
Comes straight from above<br/>
Off the top off the dome<br/>
Gotta get it, go home<br/>
Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate<br/>
What the fuck is on my mind?<br/>
I just, I just want to rhyme<br/>
This the type of shit I got to do<br/>
Oh my God, what's the time?<br/>
Can you feel it right now?<br/>
Can you feel the whole style?<br/>
It's the type of shit, I gotta get it, gotta get it<br/>
I've been vibing out here in Malibu<br/>
Would you come through?<br/>
Tell me motherfucker truly what it do?<br/>
L-O-G-I-C, this is who I be<br/>
L.A. where I'm at, M.D. what I be<br/>
All that, all that<br/>
God, I can feel it, I can feel it<br/>
I'm a fly on the wall feeling ten feet tall<br/>
Right now this the type of shit, this the style<br/>
This the motherfucking style<br/>
And so I tell em...<br/>
<br/>
This shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper, deeper than money<br/>
This shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
You know its deeper, deeper honey<br/>
This shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than your money<br/>
My money, they money, everybody money<br/>
Said, this shit is deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
Deeper than money<br/>
It's deeper than money
