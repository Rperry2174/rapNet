Uh, Uh,<br/>
Yeah I got it now what is it,<br/>
Pay the world a visit,<br/>
Let them know I'm 'bout it with this golden ticket,<br/>
See my curriculum is flippin' 'em,<br/>
A hundred and fifty one yeah we sippin' 'em,<br/>
Bitches they trippin' all up in the club,<br/>
Show me love if you really 'bout it,<br/>
I don't never doubt it,<br/>
One of the best out of Maryland I'm down to shout it,<br/>
Never cocky I'm just confident the flow is prominent,<br/>
This is the reason that I'm dominant,<br/>
That automatic platinum plated flow know I'mma shine with it,<br/>
All of y'all is down to conform but I realign with it,<br/>
Performing at a full house,<br/>
Feeling like Uncle Jesse,<br/>
Bitches they stress me,<br/>
Take them to the crib undress three,<br/>
Children lie, men lie, women lie then we die,<br/>
But I'm here to tell the truth and let you know I'm finna rise,<br/>
To no surprise,<br/>
Fake rappers meet your demise,<br/>
The microphone and Adobe Audition my only supplies,<br/>
Look within my eyes,<br/>
Yes I'll bury the odds,<br/>
Now I ask em,<br/>
Is you feelin' me?<br/>
<br/>
I got it back and now I'm on again,<br/>
Hit you in your chest like breathing after a shot of Gin,<br/>
I'm just a living organism that has arisen,<br/>
With so many bars I can manufacture for various prisons,<br/>
So let me show you what I'm bout and baby how I do it,<br/>
Flowing for hours every day just so I can improve it,<br/>
When I perform I envision a crowd and how to move it,<br/>
See I am lyrically inclined,<br/>
Alphabetically take apart and rebuild your mind,<br/>
I'm on my grind,<br/>
And guarantee ain't no style like mine,<br/>
I bring the force of course with no remorse,<br/>
I'm married to the game don't even talk about divorce,<br/>
'Till death do us part,<br/>
Reincarnate then restart,<br/>
With Biggie's eyes, Big L's mind, and Pac's heart,<br/>
Rip it apart, intravenously like poison dart,<br/>
Y'all bananas if you think I'm slipping in Mario's karts.
