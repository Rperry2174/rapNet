<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Ayo I force MC's to bleed, retreat and recede<br/>
That's the Young Sinatra creed<br/>
Killin' a track with incredible speed<br/>
And doin' it like it's nothin' or bluffin', gotta kill it everyday though<br/>
Slice MC's like Kato, gotchya head spinnin' like dreidel<br/>
Assassinate em so fatal, grip the heat and then tell ya to freeze<br/>
Gettin' chedda' at negative 30 degrees<br/>
I'm talkin' mula, money, euro, dollars, that yin<br/>
Blow it, let's spend it again, I'm livin' the life until the end<br/>
Can't comprehend what I got goin'<br/>
Never knowin' when Logic flowin', cause I'm creepin'<br/>
Like ether the way that I seep in<br/>
Swimmin' in women like the deep end<br/>
Chillin' with shorties that smoke reefer and blow like aretha<br/>
Uh, now, Sinatra said the best revenge is massive success<br/>
I guess that's women and multiple digits in excess<br/>
Ya family broke bread but my family's bread was soggy<br/>
'Til my brother's broke bricks like Mr. Miyagi<br/>
Now what the fuck...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
All of a sudden I feel the inner killer emergin'<br/>
Never splurgin' bingin' money and never purgin'<br/>
Urgin' women to fuck on the rug cause it's imported Persian<br/>
Then bypass matters of the heart like a surgeon<br/>
Now, it's hard to ball when there's problems within the inner circle<br/>
One moment they cool as Stephan and flip it like Urkel<br/>
Or flip it like keys, yeah they flip it like ki's<br/>
From drug lord's overseas that export it with ease<br/>
Bitch please we stack cheese so old it's mold<br/>
I'm 'bout that money so excuse me if my heart is cold<br/>
The magnum? deployed, then I destroy mattresses<br/>
Late night love affairs with New York City actresses, I<br/>
Broke in the game and destroyed the first couple stages<br/>
Visionary takin' over regardless of our ages<br/>
Makin' history today to solidify in the pages of tomorrow<br/>
The industry is fucked, nothin' but sorrow but I'm<br/>
Playin' for keeps in other words no need to borrow<br/>
So you can keep your advances, wack hooks, and pop dances<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I'm all about the mainstream<br/>
As long as I sign the deal I want and have the same team<br/>
And now they trippin' like a flight to Vegas<br/>
Tellin' me that I'll never make it and this shit is outrageous<br/>
Now what the fuck...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Therefore you never mourn like a memory repressed<br/>
MC's digest quicker than bullets shot from a gat with the barrel suppressed<br/>
One to the dome, two to the chest<br/>
If by chance they got a vest, however nevertheless<br/>
I'm lookin' for that real deal, shit that make me feel<br/>
Pleasure and pain, ain't no way to measure the game<br/>
I got haters in 57 languages watch me vanquish this<br/>
The come up, bust quicker than 357 caliber<br/>
Sharp as Excalibur, crushin' muthafuckas like Galaga now<br/>
Time is money, something you can never recoop (recuperate)<br/>
So stop wastin' mine, hit rewind and then fuckin' regroup<br/>
Never messed with them chicken heads, but watch me in the coup<br/>
Never in public cause I'm a studio fiend<br/>
Rockin' diamonds and gettin' money, we call that ice cream<br/>
Now, allow me to give you the scoop, shit I'll make it a double<br/>
I came up around more rocks than Barney Rubble<br/>
Murderers and drug dealers, I knew it no rebuttal ain't no need to claim it<br/>
Picked up the heat but never aimed it now<br/>
Jay gave us The Blueprint, I lay the foundation<br/>
Tell ya what I'm facin', bars like incarceration<br/>
Cause my mind is always racin', ain't no time for vacations<br/>
I'm never pacin', unless I'm on the phone talkin' business, get with' this<br/>
Best witness like Christmas, I'm fuckin' rappin'<br/>
Walkin' the spot and all these haters go for the dap and I never carried them<br/>
Kill 'em with kindness then bury 'em, yeah!<br/>
I was born with talent, ya'll gave me the gift<br/>
And now I pull more strings than guitar rifts<br/>
Now what the fuck...<br/>
Now that's all sinatra everything!
