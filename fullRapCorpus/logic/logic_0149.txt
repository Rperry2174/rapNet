<i>[Hook - Logic:]</i><br/>
I read this thing from Atmosphere the other day<br/>
Spoke about music we love and music we hate<br/>
I don't know why<br/>
But I can relate to this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Rap, bitches, money, cars only take you but so far<br/>
I can guarantee you that shit don't make up a super star<br/>
Time place, all good, whiling out like you should<br/>
Let your fingers do the talking in person I wish you would<br/>
God damn that's my jam, let me get it like this my man<br/>
Even though no body don't understand like, like, like, like<br/>
Hold up, what's the hold up?<br/>
You like what you like, she like what he like, he like what they like<br/>
They all hate what you like and you like fuck 'em all<br/>
So much division my vision is faded<br/>
We all from the same tree but you leaves degraded<br/>
Judging the different branches in music that elevated<br/>
Just cause it's further from the roots don't mean that you should hate it<br/>
Cause there's a time and place for everything that's been created<br/>
Damn, see in the end we all fam'<br/>
But all that really matters is I know who I am<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Slug:]</i><br/>
Nobody gotta agree with me, I'm just being me<br/>
I keep breathing my speech, you be<br/>
Comfortable if we never get to speak about it<br/>
You'd rather hit your hammer, just leave without it<br/>
We got a lot of light for the storm<br/>
With more shine than that lamp keeps your food warm<br/>
And the truth is un-disputable, it's beautiful<br/>
It should be considered the usual<br/>
So I ain't judging you for loving it so hard<br/>
But you disregard that we've all got old scars<br/>
My skin looks like bark<br/>
They used to do it out in the park<br/>
Pretend to defend or neglect to protect<br/>
Depends which voice the rain reflects, connection<br/>
With all the blood invested<br/>
You would think it was the love that made impressions<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Killer Mike:]</i><br/>
My woman is a smooth vision<br/>
Aye, she my muse and I'm a musician<br/>
Love her cause a couple things she do different<br/>
Me and her be whipping running and getting money<br/>
We usually put <i>[?]</i> and count a hundred<br/>
<i>[?]</i> 8-Ball &amp; MJG<br/>
I suggest you quit her now cause that bitch won't keep it G<br/>
Cause if you <i>[?]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i> we inhale it, exhale it<br/>
Early Sunday morning, on fire getting higher<br/>
To the sounds of the Georgia mass choir<br/>
And I swear to god you ain't ever really smoked reefer <br/>
till you do it to to the sound of Aretha coming loud out your speaker<br/>
Bridge over trouble water and my heart<br/>
What God has brought together let not man break apart<br/>
I swear I ain't a pair around fucking 'round with us<br/>
Cause we be like it's Pimp C bitch, now what the fuck is up?<br/>
<br/>
