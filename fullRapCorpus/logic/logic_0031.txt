<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Laughs]</i> Yo this joint here, is for all my homies that I got<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', smoke to this joint, vibe out be cool<br/>
Created a little soundtrack for when they high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
You used to hate it, now you love it<br/>
Smile in my face, I think nothing of it<br/>
Yeah I'll shake ya hand, kill 'em with kindness<br/>
Homie, this is Young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest<br/>
So spark it up, and get lifted<br/>
Please check the rappin', you know that I'm gifted<br/>
Pretty perfume, I love to sniff it<br/>
She love the stick, and the way I shift it<br/>
Automatic, in the rain<br/>
Switchin' lanes, like I switched dames<br/>
Bitches love it, and I don't know why<br/>
Maybe cause they, so God damn high<br/>
Smoking on that green, got my mind faded<br/>
Sleeping on my dreams, that's until I made it (Logic)<br/>
Cause' Bitches want it (Logic)<br/>
And women need it (Logic)<br/>
MC's, we leave 'em depleted (Logic)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah you know we fly, never fallin'<br/>
Well rounded, so you know we ballin'<br/>
Women love us, fella's hate us<br/>
I ain't perfect, but I know that I'm one of the greatest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
So I'm back again, like I never left<br/>
If you really wanna get it girl we can meet up, high price hotel most def<br/>
It's official make that pussy whistle, like a ref<br/>
And if I die tonight, what a sweet death<br/>
So I'm living large, supersize<br/>
If you want beef, I'm a leave you fries<br/>
Complimentary suits, Complimentary rides<br/>
It's all free, no charge like my phone died<br/>
I remember times, highschool<br/>
Chasing dimes, like a fool<br/>
Smoking bud, Sticky Icky<br/>
Only fuck with dank, Yeah your boy was picky<br/>
If the bag was light, Told 'em call me Ricky<br/>
Cause' you got some explaining to do!<br/>
Then we would kick it, with some pretty girls<br/>
Skipping school, making music for the whole world (Logic)<br/>
<br/>
