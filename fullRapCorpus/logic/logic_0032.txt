<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way<br/>
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Boy I know my shit was on another level<br/>
When people would joke around and say I signed with the devil<br/>
Cause it's gotta be a sin to be this good<br/>
Hating on my music shit I wish you would. (I wish you would)<br/>
Yeah I been offered four or five deals<br/>
But it's like Banana Clips boy that's four or five kills<br/>
Doing the most accumulating so much bread<br/>
I think it's time for toast and I ain't talking fine wine<br/>
I'm talking semi-automatic shit that blow your mind<br/>
Then when I blow like mine the whole world gon' see me shine<br/>
This is the life that I should live homie<br/>
I'm never going back, I'm addicted to the game<br/>
Y'all can tell by the tracks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way<br/>
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough<br/>
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way<br/>
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah Yeah Yeah<br/>
I'm addicted to the game, addicted to the pain<br/>
I'm sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain<br/>
Living the life that most won't attain<br/>
And I know it is essential<br/>
But when it comes to love, man, that shit is subsequential<br/>
For now I just be chillin' with ballers<br/>
Poppin collars, pushing impalas, cutting records and counting dollars<br/>
I'm addicted, my lines is cocain<br/>
And when they dispurse blow minds like propane<br/>
And you know these haters that never made it this mad<br/>
Cause they never had what we had<br/>
Addicted to the game and I'm glad<br/>
On my Amy Whinehouse I'm saying fuck Rehab<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way<br/>
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...
