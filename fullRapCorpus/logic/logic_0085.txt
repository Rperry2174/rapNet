Aight, well, higher probably, right? Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna make this music lovers remember again<br/>
While the haters fall back like September again<br/>
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again<br/>
Drop the politics and bring us together again<br/>
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then<br/>
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week<br/>
Cause in my mind the only way if fail if my verse weak<br/>
As I, look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces<br/>
Compiled of different races gathering from different places<br/>
I just contemplate<br/>
Shoutout to those who can relate<br/>
And even though it gets hard I know my fate<br/>
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight<br/>
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates<br/>
It’s like, I'mma get up today<br/>
I don’t know how but I'mma find a way<br/>
Looking for the sun in a world of grey<br/>
Feeling like my dreams is a world away<br/>
I'mma get up today<br/>
I don’t know how but I'mma find a way<br/>
Searching for the sun in a world of grey<br/>
Feeling like my dreams is a world away<br/>
What it feel like<br/>
I used to wonder what it feel like<br/>
Yeah, used to wonder what it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x4:]</i><br/>
I used to wonder what it feel like<br/>
But now, I know, achieved the goal<br/>
I ran the race I won the gold<br/>
<br/>
I used to wonder what it feel like<br/>
You can really do anything <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
