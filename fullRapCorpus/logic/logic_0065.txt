<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This is real life, the only one we get to live<br/>
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give<br/>
This is real life, everything we do is legendary<br/>
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery<br/>
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming<br/>
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning<br/>
Said this is real life, God damn this is real life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I've been fiending for this moment<br/>
I've been dreaming 'bout this moment<br/>
I guess this is how it feel to have everything you ever wanted<br/>
Writing these records like a dissertation<br/>
While the fans go crazy from anticipation<br/>
Damn, nine years that's a lot of patiences<br/>
And now I'm looking at my idols and feeling adjacent<br/>
It's hell of a long way from back in the basement<br/>
Looking at hip-hop tryna find my placement<br/>
I bought my first pair of Jordans at 22<br/>
Same year I bought a crib too<br/>
Now my face in magazines I used to flip through<br/>
And my music on all the sites I used to sift through<br/>
Remember meeting Nas for the first time<br/>
Shook his hand and he started quoting my lines<br/>
Said he a fan, God damn this is my time<br/>
I'm a get it, I'm a do it till we prime time<br/>
I told him every single day that I be at it<br/>
In the studio recording like an addict<br/>
He said that real hip-hop shit I had it<br/>
Thinking to myself damn man you made Illmatic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I used wonder what it feel like<br/>
Aight, I guess we back again<br/>
With another verse of about how much I'm black again<br/>
You don't like to blame God for my packaging<br/>
Bringing up my race, don't call me a white rapper then<br/>
Damn, they judging me by my skin tone<br/>
Instead of my talent, man these motherfuckers been wrong<br/>
But it's all good I just thought I'd address it<br/>
And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it<br/>
This is dedicated to anyone with a dream<br/>
And a realization of what following it means<br/>
Breaking the cycle and not following your genes<br/>
That perfect moment when your logic intervenes<br/>
And let you know that everything ain't always what it seems<br/>
But if you really looking, I promise you'll find your dreams<br/>
This is everything I ever wanted, half of y'all won't get it<br/>
The other will probably laugh and wonder how I did it<br/>
I just spit it from my mind, one word at the time<br/>
Take everything I'm going through and put it in a rhyme<br/>
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of weight upon my shoulders<br/>
But this is my therapy as I flow this<br/>
Spilling out my heart, I just hope somebody notice<br/>
I've been real from the start and you motherfuckers noticed<br/>
Once my name elevated that's when the fame escalated<br/>
But on the real, I've grown accustomed to the stares<br/>
People watching every move I make like it was theirs<br/>
All up in my business, and even in my personal affairs<br/>
Now, I know I talk a lot of game, but I ain't trynna sell you<br/>
Cause honestly, I could show you better than I could tell you<br/>
And even though there's been moments when everything have fell through<br/>
We kept it moving, assuming even the greatest fail too<br/>
I swear this business shit is do or die<br/>
I never contemplated suicide, I'm too alive<br/>
In front of thousands, but I'm talking like it's you and I<br/>
And every day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Everything I seen, made me everything I am<br/>
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jon Bellion:]</i><br/>
Said, welcome to forever<br/>
Welcome to forever<br/>
Welcome to... forever...
