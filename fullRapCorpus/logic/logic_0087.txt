<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Living life like this is so crazy<br/>
This world is amazing<br/>
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby<br/>
Living life like this I get down, uh<br/>
When they come around, uh<br/>
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound<br/>
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here<br/>
Don't fuck around cause they kill here<br/>
This music, it kill fear<br/>
I use it, when I need to hear<br/>
Been there, done that<br/>
Drop the shit and they gon' run it back<br/>
Simple shit, man I'm done with that<br/>
Fake rap, take it back<br/>
My chain heavy, got a lot of money<br/>
My bitch bad, have fun with that<br/>
I've been there and don't want it back<br/>
If I see the bitch I might run her back<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long<br/>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone<br/>
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br/>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
So what now, (so what now), let's get down<br/>
Let's get drowned, on this vision, my division is the greatest that's around<br/>
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)<br/>
This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive<br/>
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this<br/>
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this<br/>
They say "what's your motivation?"<br/>
Cutting these records like back in the basement<br/>
Boy fuck a vacation, we do this for love, not no validation<br/>
<br/>
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing<br/>
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby<br/>
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh<br/>
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long<br/>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone<br/>
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br/>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Wanna get it like this<br/>
(I think so) when I'm driving, (I drink slow) when I'm vibing<br/>
(You never know, know, know, know)<br/>
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic<br/>
I don't smoke but she love to smoke<br/>
And look good as fuck when she light it<br/>
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it<br/>
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it<br/>
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know<br/>
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?<br/>
Shit girl I know that you want it<br/>
But fuck all that<br/>
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around<br/>
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me<br/>
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone<br/>
That's the type of shit that I'm on<br/>
Grip the mic and I go (whoo!)<br/>
Fuck around with this flow<br/>
<br/>
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing<br/>
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby<br/>
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh<br/>
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long<br/>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone<br/>
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<br/>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)
