<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I wonder what it feel like<br/>
To do that shit in real life<br/>
And now I know I got it<br/>
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted<br/>
But it's still Visionary till the death of me<br/>
Yeah, I'm tryna make it but I gotta find the recipe<br/>
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me<br/>
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me<br/>
I'm tryna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me<br/>
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny<br/>
They do it for the limelight<br/>
But I make sure my rhyme's right<br/>
Waiting till the time's right<br/>
Smiling at my mom's like<br/>
Smiling at my mom<br/>
Smiling at my mamma<br/>
Moët what we sipping now<br/>
We was never tripping now<br/>
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now<br/>
'Cause they was over there, I was over here<br/>
They was too scared while I was facing my fears<br/>
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer<br/>
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm the man of the year<br/>
Man of the year <i>[5x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
They said I couldn't do it<br/>
Back when I was broke going through it<br/>
Till I got a deal, now they talking 'bout "I knew it"<br/>
But you was wasn't there in the beginning<br/>
Nowhere to be found when I was down<br/>
But you show up when I'm winning<br/>
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming<br/>
I do it 'cause I love this shit<br/>
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-<br/>
And the whips with the rims still spinning<br/>
I been at it since the beginning<br/>
All these girls screaming, "Logic!"<br/>
But I wanna hear my real name<br/>
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man<br/>
Y'all act like I'm Superman<br/>
But I can feel pain<br/>
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane<br/>
Love it when they sing to us<br/>
Been shining what's bling to us<br/>
Yeah, over here<br/>
It's only been a year<br/>
I was dirt broke, now I'm balling like a sphere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm the man of the year<br/>
Man of the year <i>[5x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Now that I'm in the limelight<br/>
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me!)<br/>
Shut the fuck up, ho!<br/>
Let me get my mind right<br/>
'Cause this is for the fans<br/>
Who truly understand<br/>
Real all the time<br/>
All of y'all my fam<br/>
Shooting for the stars<br/>
And I ain't finna land<br/>
Giving everything I can<br/>
While they tell me I'm the man<br/>
Making music is the plan<br/>
Matter fact, you can call it plan B<br/>
'Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy<br/>
And I be first to pop off – infantry<br/>
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry<br/>
We all fam, same root, smoking different tree<br/>
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony<br/>
Uh, to my ears<br/>
I love it when they cheer<br/>
On the road to success, these haters in my rear<br/>
I got nothing to fear<br/>
'Cause the whole team here<br/>
And everybody shouting (What they shouting?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You the man of the year<br/>
Man of the year <i>[5x]</i>
