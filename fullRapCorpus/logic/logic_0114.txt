I've been workin' like I've never been<br/>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br/>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br/>
What I know right now<br/>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br/>
<br/>
You ever wonder what it all really means?<br/>
Heart full of dreams, I know I'mma do it, get it by any means<br/>
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends<br/>
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems<br/>
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will<br/>
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill<br/>
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill<br/>
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will<br/>
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension<br/>
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention<br/>
You say you would if you had the money, don't make me mention<br/>
That it'll cost you nothin' but time for you to pay attention<br/>
Now don't get me wrong<br/>
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya<br/>
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya<br/>
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak<br/>
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak<br/>
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative<br/>
Talk all you want about me homie, I'mma let it live<br/>
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive<br/>
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative<br/>
<br/>
Never been<br/>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br/>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br/>
What I know right now<br/>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br/>
<br/>
This is dedicated to everyone that never made it<br/>
And the people that persevered even though they was hated<br/>
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion<br/>
But on the real the road to success is prone to collision<br/>
And every now and then something happens that's unexpected<br/>
Like that newborn in your life because you fuckin' unprotected<br/>
And I swear nobody perfect, hell I know I ain't<br/>
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint<br/>
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can<br/>
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man<br/>
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know<br/>
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe<br/>
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong<br/>
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song<br/>
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son<br/>
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun<br/>
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one<br/>
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run<br/>
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one<br/>
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one<br/>
<br/>
I've been workin' like I've never been<br/>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<br/>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<br/>
What I know right you<br/>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<br/>
<i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Um, you like that take? I like it<br/>
You sure <i>[?]</i>, or...<br/>
I think it's good, hey Bobby run it!
