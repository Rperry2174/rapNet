<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
God damn, god damn, conversations with legends<br/>
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren<br/>
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us<br/>
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus<br/>
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases<br/>
Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'<br/>
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food<br/>
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude<br/>
He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfucking kill him<br/>
I said I really want to kill him, but I can't<br/>
Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't<br/>
See my vision from pictures I paint<br/>
Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it<br/>
Okay, I'm gone, as memories resurface from hella long in my past<br/>
Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask<br/>
Little bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby<br/>
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery<br/>
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store<br/>
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door<br/>
Can’t take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A<br/>
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play<br/>
To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats<br/>
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland<br/>
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night<br/>
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking out your colon<br/>
Catch me rollin’ with the realest<br/>
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero<br/>
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas<br/>
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella<br/>
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, another illa<br/>
Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller<br/>
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa<br/>
We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love<br/>
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs<br/>
And overdose 'em like the dealer does<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thalia:]</i><br/>
Hip Hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I swear this music in my genes like Denim<br/>
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom<br/>
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer<br/>
Even though heaven sent him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
See my vision as I've elevated and risen<br/>
Open your eyes, despise lies with deadly precision<br/>
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division<br/>
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'<br/>
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings<br/>
While the label only care about making a killin'<br/>
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G<br/>
That's the shit they never see<br/>
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be<br/>
Bitch, I said I bet I be<br/>
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me<br/>
Tell me how is they gonna remember me<br/>
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe<br/>
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me<br/>
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love<br/>
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove<br/>
Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it<br/>
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred<br/>
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it<br/>
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted<br/>
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted<br/>
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1<br/>
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun<br/>
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed<br/>
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?<br/>
I just stop, and do my best to refrain<br/>
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane<br/>
Will I die? Will I live?<br/>
Give the world everything I have to give<br/>
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age<br/>
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage<br/>
Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance<br/>
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions<br/>
Our people that separated, but all equal<br/>
To know the ending one must understand the prequel<br/>
<br/>
