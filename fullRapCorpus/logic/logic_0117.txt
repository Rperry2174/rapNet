<br/>
Living life on the east coast<br/>
Way back in the day trying to beat most<br/>
Anybody that wanna do what I do<br/>
Well let me keep it one hunna with you<br/>
It ain’t about that<br/>
Ain’t about Hip Hop<br/>
Ain’t about Rap<br/>
Think a minute, hold up, use your cap<br/>
Chicago, know I’mma snap<br/>
Gotta say, no basic rapping<br/>
<br/>
So they wonder who am I, so high<br/>
I said they wonder who am I, so high<br/>
<br/>
Back again, never outside so I’m acting in<br/>
I laugh again when they don’t understand what I mean, bias<br/>
Everybody seen by us<br/>
Everybody wanna live a life like this<br/>
Man fuck that, do what’s good for your family<br/>
Make music like there’s no Grammy<br/>
For that last line they might ban me<br/>
I don’t give a fuck though<br/>
Cause I am me<br/>
From Beijing to Miami<br/>
I’mma just do what I do with my crew<br/>
Ain’t no telling what I’m finna do<br/>
But I promise that I’mma keep writing for you<br/>
And I know what to do<br/>
Everything right here for you<br/>
Only for you, depending on what you gonna do<br/>
<br/>
It’s all for you<br/>
It’s all for you<br/>
Who am I, so high<br/>
I said they wonder who am I, so high<br/>
<br/>
Let me take the time to find the rhyme<br/>
And let you know that I’m the only one<br/>
To find the one the time is done<br/>
Beyond the sky, beyond the sun<br/>
There is no one besides the only one<br/>
And you know I gotta let ‘em know<br/>
If you love it, let it go<br/>
At an all time low and all I know is, all I know<br/>
I do what I love<br/>
Came from below when there was no one above<br/>
Created a world no one has been to<br/>
Everything that I’m into<br/>
Everything that I’ve been through<br/>
Bring it back like, let it shine like a bad light<br/>
Reminisce ain’t know that night<br/>
Gotta take flight<br/>
Everybody probably wonder what I’m living like<br/>
In the middle of the night I might write<br/>
Despite what they say is right and wrong<br/>
Despite they wonder (wonder)<br/>
<br/>
Who am I, so high<br/>
I said they wonder who am I, so high<br/>
<br/>
We’d like to be painters, we’d like to be poets.<br/>
We’d like to be writers, but as everybody knows we can’t earn any money that way.<br/>
What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do,<br/>
I will say to him you do that.. and uhm, forget the money.<br/>
If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time<br/>
<br/>
You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid!<br/>
It is absolutely stupid!<br/>
Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.<br/>
And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn’t matter what it is –<br/>
somebody is interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, you will find others will<br/>
<br/>
But it’s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don’t like, and to teach our children to follow in the same track.<br/>
See what we are doing, is we’re bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living.<br/>
In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing,<br/>
so it’s all retch, and no vomit it never gets there. Therefore, it’s so important to consider this question: What do I desire?<br/>

but he’s like that bitch with like some Kung-Fu shit, he’s like with his raps. It’s fucking crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quentin Thomas:]</i><br/>
You know in...in Pulp Fiction I mean, the way Tarantino constructed his shots,<br/>
