<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah, alright, yo<br/>
A couple days ago<br/>
I met the illest latina<br/>
Her demeanor was unexplainable<br/>
You shoulda seen her<br/>
Thick thighs, nice ass<br/>
Body like an hourglass<br/>
Didn't hesitate to break a brother<br/>
Next second she passed<br/>
I was like, "What's up?"<br/>
To which she replied<br/>
"How you doin'?"<br/>
I said de nada momma<br/>
But your beauty I'm persuin'<br/>
And I said I'm about to win the lottery<br/>
She asks "How?"<br/>
I said, "Your seven digits right now"<br/>
And made her smile<br/>
Now we conversing<br/>
And she feelin' my style<br/>
I can tell by the way she talkin'<br/>
That she down to go the mile<br/>
Had a couple drinks<br/>
Now we headed back to her place<br/>
The shade of red from her lipstick all over my face<br/>
I'm tryin' to hit, split it<br/>
Baby girl you gonna let me get it?<br/>
She said, "Hold up ok, I don't get down like that"<br/>
I said I know beautiful girl<br/>
But I get down like that<br/>
So let me heat it up, heat it up<br/>
Go crazy and beat it up<br/>
"Damn papi, how you even know I like it rough?"<br/>
The way you was feelin' on me<br/>
When kissing revealed enough<br/>
I wanna scratch you, provoke you<br/>
Bite you, choke you<br/>
But just a little, bite your legs<br/>
Dick up in the middle<br/>
"Hold up, wait a second<br/>
Nigga, you gotta condom?"<br/>
Come on beautiful girl of course I've got protection<br/>
I stay with Magnums and I ain't talkin' Smith and Wesson<br/>
I keep undressin'<br/>
Girl I'm about to teach you a lesson<br/>
After I hit it she says<br/>
"Bobby I have a confession<br/>
I think I love you!"<br/>
I said "What the fuck?"<br/>
Thinkin' to myself<br/>
Damn, I shoulda never cut<br/>
Kissed her on the cheek<br/>
Hit the lights, then she fell asleep<br/>
So I snuck out the bathroom window on the creep, like<br/>
(The next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, yo<br/>
The next day, the next day, the next)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yo<br/>
Now I'm out the door<br/>
Downtown is where I'm about to go<br/>
Got a meeting with my boy Chris<br/>
About a dope show<br/>
So I hail a cab, jump in<br/>
But so does some girl<br/>
Beautiful, pretty eyes<br/>
With luxurious curls<br/>
I said "No fair"<br/>
She smiled and said<br/>
"Why don't we share?"<br/>
What a success<br/>
Lookin' at her chest<br/>
Thinkin' if her breasts was a test<br/>
She would fail<br/>
Fresh tip nails<br/>
Type of ass make a brother<br/>
Train of thought derail<br/>
As we converse<br/>
I could tell that she feelin' my style<br/>
Get the pussy wet<br/>
That's the mission<br/>
As long as she listen to my words<br/>
Feelin' on the curves<br/>
Only lips I'm thinkin' bout kissin' is hers<br/>
I can barely fight the urge<br/>
Only thing that matter right now<br/>
Is these two verbs<br/>
I'm talkin' me and you<br/>
So fine, I'd think I'd start seeing you<br/>
Her body was a work of art<br/>
Like Hieroglyphics<br/>
Too much detail to go into specifics<br/>
Now<br/>
I'm diggin' shorty<br/>
Like an archeologist<br/>
Tryin' a bone<br/>
Searchin' for a queen to take the throne<br/>
The type of girl to love<br/>
And call her my own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I'm just a bachelor (bachelor)<br/>
Looking for a bachelorette<br/>
Baby, maybe you can persuade me<br/>
To give you love<br/>
You couldn't imagine yet<br/>
Kiss you on the neck<br/>
Then I sedate the pussy like a vet<br/>
Got the shorty rollin' like a movie set<br/>
Take her to the Rio<br/>
I'm not talking about G-burg<br/>
I'm talking De Janeiro<br/>
Spend de√±ero like it's reverb<br/>
Expansion<br/>
Couple kids running round the mansion<br/>
Day dreamin'<br/>
Getting ahead of my self<br/>
Advancin'<br/>
But, come on... girl<br/>
Now come on give me love<br/>
I know we just met but<br/>
Romance is like a drug<br/>
You know we go together<br/>
Like sympathy and hugs<br/>
So I write this girl<br/>
A symphony<br/>
And tell her that I love<br/>
Her everything<br/>
Girl I love your everything<br/>
You know I love your everything<br/>
I said I love your everything<br/>
Yeah, love your everything<br/>
Girl, I love your everything
