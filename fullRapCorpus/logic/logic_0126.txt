<i>[Sample from Barrington Levy's "The Vibes is Right":]</i><br/>
If you're dealing war, backwards stay far<br/>
We're dealing with truths and rights<br/>
Come some more into my sight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit<br/>
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit<br/>
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged<br/>
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same<br/>
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome<br/>
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm<br/>
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation<br/>
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and<br/>
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement<br/>
It ain't about the money and notoriety<br/>
It's about the people and making a difference in society<br/>
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie<br/>
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding an Uzi<br/>
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?<br/>
Same level, the same rebel that never settled<br/>
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto<br/>
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered<br/>
Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me<br/>
Different stances<br/>
I used to spend all my time conversing with you<br/>
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you<br/>
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man,<br/>
It's kinda bittersweet, besides the shows and meet and greets y'all only see me on the street<br/>
And even then, that shit is rare-I just don't go outside<br/>
Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide<br/>
That misconception, "Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"<br/>
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied<br/>
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"<br/>
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit<br/>
Since the first album<br/>
I'm one of the highest earners on the label<br/>
Within six months I put the second one on the table<br/>
I've played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce<br/>
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce<br/>
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now<br/>
Just let me bounce<br/>
The mood around me is people smokin' that by the ounce<br/>
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand<br/>
Don't fuck with checks so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand<br/>
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand<br/>
Cause people don't buy music in this day and age<br/>
They buy the brand<br/>
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong<br/>
But back when I ain't have shit<br/>
Felt like I would've sold my soul to make it with this rap shit<br/>
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask<br/>
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass<br/>
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?<br/>
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that Champagne<br/>
<br/>
