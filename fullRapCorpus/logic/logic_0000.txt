Uh uh uh, yeah, V's up motherfucker what it is<br/>
Visionary takin' over the whole biz<br/>
All over your city like we in the blow biz<br/>
Never go Hollywood even though we in show biz<br/>
Baby girl, I just wanna give it to you like you never had it<br/>
When it comes to music I'm an addict<br/>
A killer, ain't none other iller for realler that's word to Dilla<br/>
Rest in peace the best with beats<br/>
And I'm 'bout to bring the heat like 5-O<br/>
Cutting records when I'm out in Cabo<br/>
Logic got more verses than the bible<br/>
I'm liable to murder anybody that pretend to be a contender<br/>
There's no better than us, the second we bust their guts, you'll trust but we get it in<br/>
Cutting records like a dividend<br/>
You can kill me but my music it will live again<br/>
Rattpack, six months on the track<br/>
GRVTY on the visual, so you know its a rap<br/>
I murder, bringing shit that you ain't never heard of<br/>
I'm goin' in raw no contraception<br/>
Red Dead Redemption, no need to mention<br/>
I'mma, murder the beat, homie word on the street, you a bitch<br/>
I plan to get rich cause my mixtape sound like an album<br/>
Your mixtape sound like shit<br/>
I don't give a damn, I am not cocky<br/>
I am Balboa even when the road is rocky<br/>
Chillin at MOCO, ya you know I gotta go<br/>
West Deer Park where I started ten years ago<br/>
Every time I see a hater they wanna get physical<br/>
Why? Cause when a girl see me we get physical<br/>
When it comes to women, I'm a Mac, you're a Dell<br/>
Pick up the mic and I shall prevail<br/>
<br/>
When the tide is high and the lights are low<br/>
You feel like there's nowhere to go<br/>
And when the stars align and the sky explodes<br/>
I'll be there, of this I know<br/>
And when the tide is high and the lights are low<br/>
You feel like there's nowhere to go<br/>
And when the stars align and the sky explodes<br/>
I'll be there, of this I know<br/>
<br/>
And when the sky, is high, so high<br/>
And when the stars align and the sky explodes<br/>
I'll be there, right there, and I ain't goin' no where<br/>
And when the sky, is high, so high<br/>
And when the stars align and the sky explodes
