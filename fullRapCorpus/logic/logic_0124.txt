Oh my God, I'm coming with the goodness<br/>
Acting like I ain't been in it<br/>

Hold up, wait up, get your weight up!<br/>
P-L-P but fuck around get the fade up<br/>
They shit is made up, straight up!<br/>
<br/>
Call me Bobby Tarantino living on the level<br/>
And I'm prophesizing everything we know<br/>
Because of the internet I made a million and another million<br/>
That's word to Gambino<br/>
He one of the realest, I swear he the realest<br/>
But anyway, back to the subject at hand<br/>
I just performed for an hour, performed for an hour<br/>
And made myself a hundred grand like...<br/>
<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my God<br/>
Wooh! That's lit, that's lit<br/>
That's gonna be the hook right there!<br/>
Yeah! I'm like, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my God<br/>

Oh my goodness, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my God<br/>
I just beat that Uncharted 4, lit<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, I been at it<br/>
RattPack if you live it, you die by that shit-get it tatted<br/>
I think I done had it now, hold up, wait up, leave 'em laid up<br/>
This for every single night that I stayed up<br/>
Real all the time, nah this shit never made up<br/>
No it's never made up, no it's, no it's straight up!<br/>
Straight up, bitch!<br/>
<br/>
I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my God, I'm coming with the goodness<br/>
Acting like I ain't been in it<br/>
Like I ain't been pushing my limit<br/>
Hold up, wait up, get your weight up!<br/>
P-L-P but fuck around get the fade up<br/>
They shit is made up, straight up!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's that Flexicution, I want retribution<br/>
Y'all gone fuck around and make me wake up Lucian<br/>
And I don't think y'all ready for the revolution<br/>
Boy your shit is pollution, Logic got the solution<br/>
Motherfuckers used to hate us<br/>
Now they sayin' that they made us<br/>
Everyone know I'm the greatest<br/>
Tell 'em, "Title your album, A Fish Outta Water"<br/>
Cause that shit be floppin'-You fuckin' suck...<br/>
Number 1 my shit droppin'<br/>
Love it or hate it, they know the name<br/>
They know the name cause it's poppin'<br/>
Dropped 2 million on my new crib<br/>
Now nobody but God can stop us!<br/>
<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my God<br/>
I'm like, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness<br/>
Oh my goodness, oh my God<br/>
