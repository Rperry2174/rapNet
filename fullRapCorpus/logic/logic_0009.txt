This right here, homie<br/>
This that first take shit, you know what I'm saying? For my real heads<br/>
All my real hip hop motherfuckers, they know they're Roots shit, you know what I mean?<br/>
So we gon' get it like this<br/>
Let that beat drop, Psychological<br/>
<br/>
I spit fifties and shit hundreds<br/>
Do shit that's undid<br/>
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts<br/>
I get 'em wet, no need to touch<br/>
Break their back like Dutches<br/>
Keep 'em close like the toast I clutch<br/>
Never the less<br/>
I'm never depressed<br/>
I keep feelings suppressed<br/>
One of the best but need to listen if I'mma progress<br/>
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap<br/>
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back<br/>
Stop, I shut it down like a bloodclot<br/>
Smoke MCs, like a fuckin bumbaclot<br/>
Mic check, I come to catch wreck<br/>
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck<br/>
I pop MCs like Hymens<br/>
Y'all glass posing in studs but I'm a diamond<br/>
Now recon, you need to listen<br/>
I'm never dissin'<br/>
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission<br/>
Catch me fishin'<br/>
Cause I'm eating for a lifetime<br/>
Wisdom in my mind<br/>
I'm a star watch me shine<br/>
Fucking your bitch from behind<br/>
Record it and hit rewind<br/>
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty<br/>
A hip-hop statue<br/>
Rhymes coming at you, God bless you<br/>
When I kick wisdom it never stress you or test you<br/>
Unless you a dumb ass motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
(Psychological) Yeah, no want no more<br/>
Fuck it, ayo<br/>
<br/>
Said this is mathematic tactics<br/>
Murder this rap shit<br/>
Intravenously inject my prophylactics<br/>
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks<br/>
Similar to black ice cause the flow so slick<br/>
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up<br/>
Do a whole 'lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs<br/>
Ah, yeah, (turn my headphones up)<br/>
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough<br/>
Raw, rugged and rough<br/>
My alter ego, Mr. Tough<br/>
I'll call your bluff<br/>
Face to face never snuff<br/>
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit<br/>
No mercy cause if I grip the mic they might curse me<br/>
Da Vinci flow<br/>
Then I grip the mic I'm in control<br/>
Before I manifested tendons I was rhyming as a embryo<br/>
Living in vertigo<br/>
Half of these fuckers don't know<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, all day<br/>
Drop tracks like that<br/>
All nuts in<br/>
Maryland stand up, that's it<br/>
I'm out, peace, one love<br/>
Fuck if you doubt me<br/>
<br/>
(You are watching a master at work)<br/>
Todd? Todd? Would you care for a glass of grape juice?<br/>
Nigga, what the fuck is juice?<br/>
I want some grape drink, baby
