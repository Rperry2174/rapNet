Yeah, my name is Riley, son<br/>
But you know what niggas call me?<br/>
AKA, Riley Escobar, know what I'm saying?<br/>
Cause I be in the streets you know?<br/>
I got all kinds of names like HR Paper Stacks<br/>
Uh, also known as AKA Horse Choker, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Hey, yo, I'll chop you up in sixteen pieces<br/>
In front of your nieces, while I'm eating Reese's<br/>
And won't even offer them any, yes I spit plenty<br/>
This is East Coast flow at it's finest<br/>
In the studio, where you find us, put a bullet where your spine is<br/>
At sixteen I was skipping school and smoking chronic<br/>
While you was learning about English, Big L was teaching Ebonics<br/>
I spit fire so demonic, writing code like I'm Masonite<br/>
A Jedi master breaking it down like old plaster<br/>
No medication for this track cause this is how a psycho rips<br/>
My bank account is like a cino bolt, your pocket's microchips, uh<br/>
Motherfucker, I dare you to test it, hope you're well rested<br/>
Whoop your ass and get arrested, in a double breasted<br/>
Louis Vuitton diamond encrested tailor made suit<br/>
Now that's All Sinatra Everything<br/>
I explode like hollow tips on contact<br/>
Chronologically murder schmoe there's no bringing Joe back<br/>
Puffing cubans and sipping Cognac<br/>
Mafietic mentality, introduce me to this beat and it's fatality<br/>
I kill mics like Conrad Murray<br/>
Sharp like Hanzo steel, the rest is obtuse<br/>
I get loose when sipping Goose and rhyme like Doc Seuss<br/>
Flow tight like noose, whoop ass like Bruce, no time for a truce<br/>
Alphabetical mathematic addict<br/>
I spit sixteens so erratic you think it was a semi-automatic<br/>
I know by now you thinking "Oh my God, he let them have it"<br/>
But that was just a loan, time to collect like I'm Capone<br/>
Reap what I've sewn, in other words that is the throne<br/>
Chilling while homies smoking marijuan'<br/>
If you thinking that this shit is wack well then you're dead wrong<br/>
Cause for every emotion and every mood I have a song<br/>
For the club, for the streets, for the whip and for the sheets<br/>
Cause this is where intellect and versatility meets<br/>
I'm Young Sinatra, backstage chilling with BobbySoxers<br/>
I got ya.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
You wanna fuck with us?!<br/>
Fuck with us, yeah!?
