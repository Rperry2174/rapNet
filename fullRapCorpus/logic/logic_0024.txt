Wake up, you bitch ass<br/>
Cracker ass, motha fucka<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
See all I ever wanted was a window to sit close to<br/>
And you don't understand but in the end you ain't supposed to<br/>
I'm talking first class, 30, 000 feet under my ass<br/>
Living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash<br/>
Now I'm living a life that you and yours could only dream about<br/>
And just a couple ago this shit I used to scheme about<br/>
Rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror<br/>
Until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer<br/>
See this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days<br/>
Fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days<br/>
Good God, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance<br/>
96' Kool-Aid and Sega Genesis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey yo, Hey yo, how you keep it so real<br/>
I love the way your lyrics make me feel<br/>
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly<br/>
Feeling like I'm 30, 000 feet up in the sky<br/>
<br/>
I got em' saying<br/>
<br/>
Hey yo, Hey yo, how you keep it so real<br/>
I love the way your lyrics make me feel<br/>
Roll it and get high, Light it up and fly<br/>
Feeling like I'm 30, 000 feet up in the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
So many people think that they know my whole situation<br/>
Conversations with people that handle public relations<br/>
Nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations<br/>
Slowly pacing until I kill like that boy Jason<br/>
It ain't nothing, never folding or bluffin'<br/>
Get money, fuck bitches but respect women cause we love em'<br/>
Kiss em', touch em' and rub em'<br/>
Fuck em' but never grub em'<br/>
Hit fast but then I slow it down like Robitussin<br/>
Shorty giving me brain until concussion<br/>
The club run out of vodka the second we rush in<br/>
Never under estimate the power in which I'm bustin'<br/>
My lyricism got yo girl blushin'<br/>
Ain't even touch her and yet she gushin' (ha)<br/>
Award shows, chilling with all my bros<br/>
3-piece Ralph Lauren and some Jordan's I suppose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
