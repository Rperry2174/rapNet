<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm Tryna write my wrongs but its funny them same wrongs help me write this song now<br/>
I'm Tryna write my wrongs but its funny them same wrongs help me write this song now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
See I was born into a world of food stamps and welfare<br/>
No dollar for the ice cream man and nappy hair<br/>
Raised by a single mom but in the back of my mind I thought I gotta have my pops no cereal<br/>
Never had a lot but now I got plenty material<br/>
No longer, do I wish for money cause being broke made me stronger, Harder, faster, better<br/>
So now I alphabetically murder every letter<br/>
Uh, feel the conviction in my words like a jail sentence<br/>
Murderin' a first through a verse won't be no repentance<br/>
Momma I'm sorry that I left at Seventeen<br/>
But I had to chase my dream and get this mofuckin cream<br/>
Only people that I got is the people that's on my team<br/>
Cause when I roll up on the scene I see everyone start to scheme<br/>
Talk about they connections, talk about who they know<br/>
Then they beggin' me for a feature and I'm like hold up yo<br/>
If you know who you know why the fuck you ain't blow<br/>
Matter fact you ain't fuck with me this time last year though<br/>
I was kicking rhymes but you ain't paid on mind or the soul<br/>
And you on my dick riding like the baddest of hoes<br/>
You think its easy but its not<br/>
See the talent that I got<br/>
Determination keep it fresh if I don't shine in this gold mine<br/>
Cause it don't happen overnight<br/>
One hit wonders don't keep the spot<br/>
And I plan to hold the torch until I pass it and get shot, What<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
See this is dedication running up on radio stations<br/>
They with the glind enter my mind they was just hatin' haha<br/>
Testing my patience they got me pissed like probation<br/>
But I had the mind to keep going and the heart to keep racing<br/>
And as the world crumbled beneath my feet like a Hatian<br/>
I was inspired by them to persevere through dedication<br/>
Failure I'm never facing my lyrics is education<br/>
So if you got the tape crank that shit like Jason Statham<br/>
Yeah, this is my story word by word as I'm emerging just relax and let me open your mind like brain surgeon<br/>
Uhh, fresh in the game they should sign me the the virgin<br/>
But me and solo know that I would only get to splurgin'<br/>
I see the road to success and now its time to merge em<br/>
Don't forget its when you gone what my homies urging, don't forget its when you gone, uhh I gotcha<br/>
You see these Seinfeld rappers talking a whole lot of nothing so allow me to curve your enthusiasm or something<br/>
This is kinda like M.J before his prime when he dunking cause I ain't 23 yet but when I'm there it'll be something<br/>
<br/>

I'm Tryna write my wrongs but its funny them same wrongs help me write this song now<br/>
I'm Tryna write my wrongs but its funny them same wrongs help me write this song now<br/>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Growing up there was baby momma drama everyday and every way<br/>
But now my kids I ain't got none to this day<br/>
Cause a rubber â€˜round my Jimmy when I consider foreplay<br/>
Hey, back in the day West Deer Park where we stay<br/>
I was running around while momma was drinking everyday<br/>
But its okay I wouldn't have it any other way<br/>
Cause it developed me into the young man that you see today<br/>
Through dedication Yeah, Yeah<br/>
Never follow traditions you see I had a different vision<br/>
I always skip school and writin' compositions 'bout my home conditions<br/>
You know the usual no money and family division<br/>
In specific I remember this time in my kitchen<br/>
With my sisters man back before he went to prison and got into religion<br/>
He showed me how to cook crack at 12 and I ain't kiddin'<br/>
After releasing him with ba-- he no longer living<br/>
And I'm pretty sure his last breath was lord forgive him<br/>
Now my nephew ain't got a father that'll keep him safe<br/>
All I can hope is he a good boy for his mommas sake<br/>
Cause she never did recover from his fathers fate<br/>
And if he grew into a man that made the same mistake<br/>
Well to be honest I don't know how much more she could take<br/>
So to every baby momma that could truly relate it is you unto this song that I should dedicate<br/>
<br/>
Yeah
