We gon' Switch it up like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Uh, now, I'm off the hook, so none of y'all can debate it<br/>
Started making music, cause I never really related<br/>
To this bullshit, that they spit, claiming that they made it<br/>
Similar to a eight guard, cause I can't fade it<br/>
Use your logic, you could never evade it<br/>
I'm kinda like the Young Sinatra, mixed with Sammy Davis Jr<br/>
Already knowing they are, two of the best to ever to do it<br/>
Rhyming to improve and take rap<br/>
And move it in another direction, spread like infection<br/>
Better yet, lice, cause I'm always on their mind<br/>
I'm a breed of different kind, yes<br/>
I'm ahead of my time when it comes to the rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
You can catch me in the booth, from dusk, 'til the sun up<br/>
That Super Mario flow, I always get the one up<br/>
Yeah, we gun up, laser gotta help me run up <i>[gun shots]</i><br/>
Not really, but it sounded tight, shut up<br/>
Fuck around, steal your bitch, just to get the nut up<br/>
Really, what up? With everybody looking for a deal<br/>
You can call me Indy-ana Jones and I'm headed for the throne<br/>
Going on a M.J. beat, leave me alone, this is music<br/>
Who are you to tell me how to use it?<br/>
Never confuse it, originality, I'll never lose it<br/>
Maybe I'm a little psycho, for hopping on the beat<br/>
But the logical part of me, telling me, you're feeling B<br/>
See? I'm a lyrical entity, blowing minds like Kennedy<br/>
With controversial lines, so everybody remember me<br/>
I'm repping Maryland, if you bite<br/>
I'll snap on you, like a Terrapin<br/>
Flyer than an airplane<br/>
I'm just fucking around<br/>
Switch it up with various styles, just to keep you around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
Some people are entertainers and some people are great entertainers<br/>
Some people are followers and some people make the path and are pioneers
