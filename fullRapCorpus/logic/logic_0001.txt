I blow your mind like cocaine, nah<br/>
I blow your mind like Cobain<br/>
Rest in Peace<br/>
Sucker MC's deceased<br/>
Rise on the East I'm the sun bringing heat for sure<br/>
I've been making tracks on the low<br/>
Waiting for my time to shine and then blow like Johnny, Depp<br/>
Increase the rep<br/>
Like a bench press set homie yes I get red<br/>
Paid my dues but I'm still in debt<br/>
Cause I have no credibility in the game yet<br/>
Gotta apply, and run a background check<br/>
But I bounce<br/>
Cause I ain't done shit yet<br/>
Right now, that's what I'm trying to do<br/>
Stay spitting rhymes whenever I roll through<br/>
Call me the Grinch, homie I don't give a hoo<br/>
Any MC yes I gotta kill you<br/>
But don't take it personal it's business fool<br/>
Do like Travolta just be cool<br/>
And nowadays everybody sound the same<br/>
The Price is Right, but I don't play that game<br/>
Won't never stop 'till they all know my name<br/>
Gotta grind to the top rid Rodriguez with the fame<br/>
Homie if I kill you accept that you're gone<br/>
This ain't Call of Duty you can't respawn<br/>
Had your girl down talking on jive<br/>
'Till I hit you with the MP5<br/>
Suppression, I really hope y'all learned your lesson<br/>
And never forget that I'm the unsung freshman
