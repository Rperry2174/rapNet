<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
I'm 'bout to get it right now<br/>
All these motherfuckers wonder how<br/>
All the pretty girls love the style<br/>
And they wonder if he well endowed<br/>
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Come on baby girl, tell me what you want, I got what you need<br/>
Said she independent, so don't get offended if she leave<br/>
I said I won't get offended<br/>
I'll just get some Fendi<br/>
And repress my emotions and material shit that can be a distraction<br/>
Pussy and money, sometimes I feel the satisfaction<br/>
'Til I spend that bread and bust that nut and now I'm back, son<br/>
After the damage is done<br/>
Rearrange the game and let 'em know your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
You know the drill, come on you know the deal<br/>
If my shorty acting up, I'll wife swap like Uncle Phil<br/>
Moving at the speed of sound, let's slow it down and keep it trill<br/>
Yeah we keep it real, kill 'em with kindness and not the steel<br/>
Yeah, we livin' it up<br/>
You know that this is my everything, I'm never givin' it up<br/>
All the time, (yeah we do it)<br/>
And now I feel like I wanna keep going, my cards never showing<br/>
Don't know what's in hand<br/>
I love my fans, but this here girl want me, tell me I'm the man, I know I am<br/>
But never acknowledge it<br/>
Touring the country, I'm loving these colleges<br/>
Touching more pussy than a gynecologist<br/>
Study her body like I'm a biologist, with no apology<br/>
Baby girl follow me<br/>
She got low, blow my kiss of criminology<br/>
And she be loving the way I be flowing<br/>
And I know that infatuation is growing<br/>
If you catch them feelings you better be slowing it down<br/>
Cause we both know what happens when that love come around<br/>
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you, I want you to be mine<br/>
Maybe one day it will be, but I don't have the time<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
Shorty say she love me and she know every word<br/>
To every song on every mixtape<br/>
"When your album droppin'? Tell me which date<br/>
Everything you say to me, I can relate<br/>
The fact that we met right here, right now on this night, it must be fate"<br/>
Now I'll be damned, time moves so fast<br/>
Couple months back, I had a meeting with my last<br/>
Reminiscing about love, discussing matters of the past<br/>
Looking in them eyes, but I'm thinking 'bout that ass<br/>
I took her for coffee, she took me for granted<br/>
Now I show no emotion and my shorty can't stand it<br/>
And now you know<br/>
I'm on my grind, I keep my exes in line like 'tic tac toe'<br/>
And I finally got 'em all about my vision<br/>
However, I'm all they see when they turn on the television<br/>
<br/>
