Aye, let me just rap<br/>
I've upgraded while they've waited<br/>
Will they love it, will they hate it<br/>
Never fade it I evade it<br/>
Cause I never really want to complicate it<br/>
Think I've made it, yes I did<br/>
I'm giving them bars like a bid<br/>
Let me rewind it like a vid<br/>
"Did he just say that?" Yes, I did<br/>
And they wanna get it like I live<br/>
God damn mother fucker what I gotta give<br/>
Way back in DC, I live<br/>
On the way to that everlasting life<br/>
Will they rob you? Yeah, they might<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, veer to the right<br/>
On this road to success, I've faced my fears<br/>
Then hop on that flight<br/>
<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
<br/>
My bitch bad got a sick figure<br/>
Play one show and get 6 figures<br/>
We build bigger, money tall as a mountain, bitch<br/>
I've got Hilfigers, like goddamn<br/>
Yes sir, I know who I am<br/>
I'm that main man Martin, out here kicking out Pam<br/>
Just riding 'round with my Gina in that all-black Beamer<br/>
All the way from Maryland whipping out West Coast vino<br/>
Hold up, now check my demeanor<br/>
Yeah, your girl bad, my girl meaner<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
<br/>
I've got that Akira on the wall<br/>
I just can't follow their law<br/>
Swear to God that they know me<br/>
They don't know me at all<br/>
And its all right, it's alright<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
<br/>
Let me bring in them new kicks like Timbaland<br/>
I gotta reboot with this upgrade<br/>
My metaphors on Cloud 9 and the meaning behind them is so vague<br/>
Before I created this universe, I had to fly to the Bermuda first<br/>
6 on the beat then we queue the verse<br/>
Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge<br/>
Feel like I'm in a 5th element<br/>
I'm on my element lost in paradise<br/>
It's me, you and Leeloo Korben Dallas<br/>
In Fhloston Paradise<br/>
Never by chance like a pair of dice<br/>
I don't give a fuck about their advice<br/>
I'm on another planet, no I'm not manic, bitch I'm decompressed<br/>
Know they can't stand it cause I pilot it and manned it the best<br/>
All they demanded was I gave up and laid that dream to rest<br/>
God DAMN!<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, fuck all that shit<br/>
I left Earth ages ago to avoid and duck all that shit<br/>
You know when we on<br/>
Making music that's gon' survive for eons<br/>
Bloodshed from America to Sierra Leone<br/>
That's that shit I can't be on<br/>
That's the reason I be gone<br/>
Yes, I keep it professional<br/>
Like Luc Besson and Leon<br/>
<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded<br/>
I've upgraded
