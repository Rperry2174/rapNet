<i>[Sample from Life's A Bitch by Nas:]</i><br/>
Visualizing the realism of life in actuality<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Various women I'm swimming in like a shark<br/>
Tear the pussy apart<br/>
Shawty it's on after dark<br/>
<br/>
Step to the mic and now I got ya<br/>
Call me Young Sinatra<br/>
The flow is prominent<br/>
Hella diming it, on time with it<br/>
When I'm rhyming it, several labels itching to sign with it<br/>
<br/>
Now check the women I'm bringing in with these I'll synonyms<br/>
Softly killing 'em<br/>
In other words; I'm Lauryn Hillin 'em<br/>
I swear to God if I could I'd never turn the page<br/>
<br/>
Living the rest of my days on stage<br/>
Fucking with bitches that never age<br/>
I'm so fly that I defy the laws of physics<br/>
I ain't think it was possible for a check to have this many digits, Mathematically exquisite<br/>
<br/>
Am I cocky? Just a smidget<br/>
If you want beef then we can supersize<br/>
Freshman in the game, so they wanna haze me like my name Isaac<br/>
I killed the beat and dig a ditch just to fossilize<br/>
To make sure none of you bammers try to reprise it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm working a nine to five just to survive<br/>
Barely staying alive<br/>
Hard to stay focused without the drive<br/>
See I bus tables and my homie Castro is a waiter<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to blow and say "I told you so haters!"<br/>
Living the life of a egotistical pistol gripper<br/>
Isn't a life for me, I'd rather grip mics and a undo girls zippers<br/>
But not them ho girls, meet me after the show girls, the take it slow girls, have 'em coming back for mo' girls<br/>
<br/>
(Visualizin the realism of life and actuality)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Various managers coming up talking bout they got me<br/>
But really they shady and they slim in a pair of Versaces<br/>
I know you see me shining, and practicing and grinding<br/>
While they conform to the norm you'll catch me designing<br/>
<br/>
A different type of sound<br/>
While you was stuck inside the box, I had already been around<br/>
Inner piece and happiness I'm always tryna' find it<br/>
And I kinda got the feeling that a woman is behind it<br/>
<br/>
So I'm always chasing tails the real life sonic<br/>
And I'm always spitting fire half black, half demonic<br/>
Nah, I'm half black and half white, c'mon this sound it had to come from somewhere, right?<br/>
Nah, Nah, see homie race is not the issue, and if you stepping to me like it is I'll dismiss you<br/>
<br/>
The second you listen<br/>
The second I got you<br/>
I swear to God I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some (plus some, plus some)
