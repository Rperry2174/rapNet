<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Hey mothafucka, I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And you don't gotta like it but get off my, off my<br/>
Hey mothafucka, I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And you don't gotta like it but get off my dick<br/>
<br/>
Fight the power, fight the power<br/>
Fight for the right to get up and say fuck white power<br/>
Everybody come and get up, get on<br/>
And no matter what you fighting for I promise that it'll live on<br/>
Like make America great again<br/>
Make it hate again<br/>
Make it white<br/>
Make everybody fight<br/>
Fuck that<br/>
Street's disciple<br/>
My raps are trifle<br/>
I shoot slugs from my brain just like Cobain<br/>
And everybody wonder why the world insane<br/>
Why the world insane<br/>
Why the world insane<br/>
Why the world insane<br/>
<br/>
Hey mothafucka, I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And you don't gotta like it but get off my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Black Thought:]</i><br/>
The world going mad over one drug<br/>
I'm filling up a bag at the gun club<br/>
In the shadow of a nation that it once was<br/>
All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood<br/>
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov<br/>
The man in the high castle in a hot tub<br/>
We locked in a pine casket, it's botched up<br/>
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury<br/>
The way they can plead the fifth to the 13th<br/>
And stop to search me, controversy<br/>
Them boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Hey mothafucka, I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And you don't gotta like it but get off my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chuck D:]</i><br/>
Young blood, it takes another look and feel<br/>
Slap that fear monger at that wheel<br/>
Olive branches in the arrow seal<br/>
Alternative facts mean to lie and steal<br/>
Gotta to go to bed a hoe<br/>
Refugee population from the land they stole<br/>
In the name of the government<br/>
Rich white man while the rest be suffering<br/>
Run from the locked down borders<br/>
Ain't like Flint ain't got clean water<br/>
Dirty politics never come clean<br/>
Can ya'll believe this shit in 2017?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Hey mothafucka, I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And you don't gotta like it but get off my, off my dick<br/>
<br/>
George bush don't care about black people<br/>
2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so<br/>
Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't<br/>
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want<br/>
Man it's all love but the youth is confused<br/>
Your music is 2020 but them political views<br/>
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred<br/>
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word<br/>
But I gotta say what need be said<br/>
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that's white and red<br/>
I know some people wish I'd act white instead<br/>
Say I'd use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead<br/>
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right<br/>
To teach the people that they have the power to fight<br/>
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night<br/>
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact<br/>
Nobody treated equally, especially the black<br/>
If you don't get it the first time, bring it back<br/>
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights<br/>
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites<br/>
To make it happen though we gon' need patience<br/>
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now<br/>
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop<br/>
I'm just as angry another person got shot<br/>
Don't be angry at the color of they skin<br/>
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and<br/>
I'ma tell you what I need right now<br/>
I'ma tell you what we all need<br/>
I need my people of color...<br/>
Don't run from Trump, run against him<br/>
<br/>
Hey mothafucka I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And you don't gotta like it but get off my, off my<br/>
Hey mothafucka, I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And you don't gotta like it but get off my dick<br/>
<br/>
Ohh, hands up for the 5-0<br/>
Oh, ohh, hands up for the 5-0<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
I been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck<br/>
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a damn<br/>
I just wanna live, I just wanna eat<br/>
But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh<br/>
<i>[Big Lenbo:]</i><br/>
Dope in the trunk<br/>
Creepin out the cut<br/>
9 by the gut<br/>
Never get enough<br/>
I don't give a fuck<br/>
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards<br/>
Mastered the hustle<br/>
Something in the duffle for you bastards<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i> Grind over chatter<br/>
<i>[Big Lenbo:]</i><br/>
Cheese on my mind like a packer<br/>
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter<br/>
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K<br/>
Middle of the day, like that shit's okay<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Never had a job, never had a education<br/>
Only know probation<br/>
Never had a job never had a education<br/>
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one<br/>
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[No I.D. (Logic):]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Now send the blacks back to Africa<br/>
Build a wall for the Mexicans<br/>
Send the whites back to Europe<br/>
Give the land to the Native American<br/>
Take the skyscraper<br/>
Tear down the casino<br/>
Print your own paper<br/>
And bear down on the gringo<br/>
Take the skyscraper<br/>
(Take the skyscraper)<br/>
Tear down the casino<br/>
Tear down the casino<br/>
Print your own paper<br/>
(Print your own paper)<br/>
And bear down on the gringo<br/>
(And bear down on the, down on the, down on the)<br/>
Take the skyscraper<br/>
(The skyscraper)<br/>
Tear down the casino<br/>
(Tear down the casino)<br/>
Print your own paper<br/>
(Print your own paper)<br/>
And bear down on the gringo<br/>
(Bear down on the, down on the...)<br/>

<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Hey mothafucka, I'm real as shit<br/>
Everything I'm talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit<br/>
Aw yeah, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
