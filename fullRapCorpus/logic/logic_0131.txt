I want what I want how I want when I want it<br/>
I'ma keep it a hunnid, I'm blunted<br/>
I don't give a damn, I don't give a fuck about another man<br/>
Fuck a brother man<br/>
I'ma make it make it rain like no other man<br/>
Old girl shoulda shoulda got a better man<br/>
Ass fat, lookin good in my letterman<br/>
In the hood I'm a better man<br/>
Wish a mothafucka would, would<br/>
Whole life I been up to no good<br/>
Change it all if I could<br/>
Rearrange my heart to beat good but I can't<br/>
I'm a sinner not a saint<br/>
Layers to my life, no I can't<br/>
Cover it up with paint<br/>
Keep on livin, livin<br/>
Livin on money and women<br/>
As soon as I'm in em I'm out<br/>
Now the truth never come out my mouth<br/>
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like<br/>
I'm a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life<br/>
A waste of skin<br/>
Wanna repent, don't know where to begin<br/>
Next of kin don't give a damn bout me<br/>
I know God don't give a damn bout me<br/>
People try but don't know bout me<br/>
But the devil said that he want my soul<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
<br/>
Somebody save me, I need you to save me<br/>
To wash away my sins on high<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be a different man in another world<br/>
Than work for the man in my universe<br/>
Wonder what it feel like, to take flight<br/>
Momma told me everything gon be alright<br/>
I mean my life can't be off right<br/>
But come to think about it everybody runnin the world seem to be all white<br/>
Can you mothafuckas see alright?<br/>
I mean I need it, I want it, I gotta have it<br/>
Every day tragic<br/>
If you're from where I'm from everyday ain't magic<br/>
On this I know<br/>
I been telling everybody I'ma give it a go, I know<br/>
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!<br/>
Love it or hate it, I made it<br/>
I did it, I lived it<br/>
While the whole world lookin at the boy like whoa!<br/>
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey<br/>
Really wonder what the remedy<br/>
Tell me, how the world gon remember me?<br/>
Got me feelin like the enemy<br/>
Like I ain't got no energy<br/>
I been lookin for an entity<br/>
Feelin like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity<br/>
Fuck all that<br/>
I'm a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life<br/>
A waste of skin<br/>
Wanna repent, don't know where to begin<br/>
Next of kin don't give a damn bout me<br/>
I know God don't give a damn bout me<br/>
People try but don't know bout me<br/>
But the devil said that he want my soul<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
Give it to me right now<br/>
<br/>
Somebody save me, I need you to save me<br/>
To wash away my sins on high<br/>
<br/>
I know my life was lived the wrong way<br/>
I know I did you wrong in my own way<br/>
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized<br/>
That hypnotized the only<br/>
Part of me you loved<br/>
Part of me that had the strength to rise above Part of me you know<br/>
Part of me you love more than to let it go
