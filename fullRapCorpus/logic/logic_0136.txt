I don't know what I'ma do<br/>
I don't know where I'ma live<br/>
'Cause it feel like I ain't got nothing give<br/>
Just wanna follow my dreams<br/>
Just wanna follow my heart<br/>
But the world wanna tear me apart right from start<br/>
Everything I ever wanted, it ain't what I thought<br/>
Bring it back to the roots like my name Black Thought<br/>
This shit right here, no it can't be taught<br/>
Gotta be learned, it gotta be earned<br/>
I ain't got a pocket full of money but I'm full of hope<br/>
I don't wanna rob people, I don't wanna push dope<br/>
I just wanna live, I just wanna maintain<br/>
Like a bullet to the brain<br/>
Gotta play the game like a chess board<br/>
If yah wanna go to war, gotta bring yah best sword<br/>
I feel like I'm going crazy, like I need a psych ward<br/>
Think my mind playing tricks on me like a Geto Boy<br/>
Feel like I need to murder 'em in the moment I deploy<br/>
Everybody, anybody, somebody fill the void, somebody fill the void<br/>
Listen, I don't wanna work a job, motherfuck a 9 to 5<br/>
Every time I get a check, what I really get? Robbed<br/>
Livin in America, this shit is a facade<br/>
But you gotta push through and persevere, word to God<br/>
Tryna find a home, but I can't afford a home<br/>
'Cause I'm 25 and owe a hunnid grand in student loans<br/>
Tryna get healthcare, but I'm on welfare<br/>
Man I swear to God, I wish I was living in Bel Air<br/>
Fuck Medicaid, I just wanna get paid<br/>
With' a couple bad bitches at the crib, gettin' laid<br/>
That's what I'm taught by the media<br/>
Television tellin' my vision to get greedier<br/>
Come now everybody stay tune like T-Pain<br/>
Operate the drive in yah mind like a keychain<br/>
Come now folk, get woke, stay woke<br/>
'Cause the white man want the black man stay broke<br/>
Fuck that, I'm finna buck back<br/>
But not with bullets, I'ma use my education to the fullest<br/>
I'ma get out of debt, I'ma reset<br/>
I'ma get out of debt, I'ma reset<br/>
Do whatever you gotta do whenever to live<br/>
But you gotta remember to give back when you get that When you finally get to the top and you hit that pinnacle<br/>
I ain't being cynical, I'm just being real<br/>
I believe that everybody feel, everybody feel, listen up Everybody over here<br/>
I promise to God on everything it ain't nothing to fear Anybody that can hear, just fight<br/>
Fight for the right<br/>
Fight for ya life<br/>
Fight for what you believe is right<br/>
Fight for what you believe is right<br/>
Everybody fight<br/>
Everybody fight<br/>
Matter fact, everybody beautiful<br/>
But right, what now I need<br/>
<br/>
