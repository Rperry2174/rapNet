I got a date with destiny<br/>
My heart says yeah but can't convince the rest of me<br/>
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe<br/>
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me<br/>
I need redemption no need to mention my past<br/>
Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash<br/>
The glits the glamour the lights the camera the action<br/>
The stage the fans the speakers blastin'<br/>
You know I'm wanted I need it don't doubt it I can't live without it<br/>
It's just everything I dreamed of<br/>
It's everything I've ever wanted<br/>
But is it really truly in my plans<br/>
Or did God mix up my blue prints<br/>
Did he have it right there in his hands?<br/>
Anybody give me a hint<br/>
I can feel it now I know it's coming<br/>
And I don't give a fuck what anybody say<br/>
I've fallen I've risen I chose to select to dismiss an incarnation through these bars created-a prison<br/>
And I intend to do the time and the sentence that's given<br/>
25 to life yeah that's how I'm living<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever make it<br/>
But there's only way I'm a know<br/>
I'm like a seed planted in the dirt<br/>
Feels like I've been waiting forever to grow<br/>
And maybe today is the day<br/>
And maybe tonight is the night<br/>
But one thing that I know for sure<br/>
This time I'm a get it right
