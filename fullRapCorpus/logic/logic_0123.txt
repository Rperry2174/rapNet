<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Yeah I've been killin' this shit<br/>
Yeah I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br/>
Yeah I've been flickin' that wrist<br/>
Yeah I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br/>
Yeah I've been killin' this shit<br/>
Yeah I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist<br/>
Yeah I've been flickin' that wrist<br/>
Yeah I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this<br/>
Yeah I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit<br/>
Yeah I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist<br/>
Yeah I've been killin' this, cookin' that<br/>
Killin' this, flickin' that wrist<br/>

<i>[Logic (Pusha T):]</i><br/>
Let me tell you 'bout the young man<br/>
Matter of fact, I'm a let Push tell that<br/>
Tell you 'bout the old man<br/>
Had a change of heart and then fell back<br/>
Old man lived a long life<br/>
Walked around with a long knife<br/>
You ain't cut the white like Jesus<br/>
That Colombiana, that's me and models like (YUGH)<br/>
Look at the flick of that wrist<br/>
I'm feelin' like Leonardo<br/>
Let me paint a picture, I might need a bottle<br/>
On the road to success like I feel the throttle<br/>
That Michelangelo, hundreds in the envelope<br/>
Tight shit when I write shit<br/>
And that old man had a change of heart<br/>
Wish, they knew it back from the start like goddamn<br/>
Looked around, seen his wife on the ground<br/>
Military bussin' bullets all over the whole compound<br/>
Soon as he seen it, I swear it, I mean it, my members go quicker than vamonos<br/>
He dead, she dead, he in jail<br/>
Everyone fallin' like dominoes<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Simple Logic<br/>
Clockwise, counterclockwise<br/>
Realest nigga in the top five<br/>
Other four ain't rap niggas<br/>
I'm just reppin' for the blow side<br/>
Yeah, that's coastlines<br/>
Panama for the boat rides<br/>
Worth billions, and we ain't even need Showtime<br/>
Just money counters and kitchen wear<br/>
Condo with a bitch in there<br/>
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!<br/>
The Rollie's been the trophy<br/>
Since Hawaiian Sophie<br/>
Curry over Kobe, we shootin' niggas<br/>
Splash brothers with the coke<br/>
Add in baking soda<br/>
Goodfellas to my niggas<br/>
Yeah! Already owed us<br/>
Shades of blue, I aim at you<br/>
Let the sky fall, let it rain on you<br/>
<br/>
