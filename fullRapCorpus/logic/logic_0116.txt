<i>[Kai:]</i> What'd you wanna be when you grew up?<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Honestly, a musician<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> What?<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> I know man crazy right<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> Nah, what's crazy is original music hasn't been created since Earth<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> I know man. Lucidity<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> What?<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Back then people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness.<br/>
Shit we took for granted was obvious: water, food supply.<br/>
It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I guess that's what I'm looking for<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> What, being able to make music?<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Not just that. If the laws are abolished following the migration - we're free dude<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> We're not slaves Thomas<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> We aren't? You can't do anything outside the cause, not really.<br/>
That's why we watch the same movies and listen to the same music.<br/>
I mean don't get me wrong the catalogue is incredible, but we need... I don't know<br/>
<i>[Thalia:]</i> Something more?<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Yeah, somethin' more
