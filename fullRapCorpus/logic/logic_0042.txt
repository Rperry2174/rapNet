<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I know what it's like<br/>
To be all, all depressed<br/>
And not wanna go out and<br/>
And live life and<br/>
That's not healthy man<br/>
You can't be living like that what's wrong with you?<br/>
<br/>
Hi<br/>
Yeah hey you, yeah you<br/>
Yea yea uh huh<br/>
I know you been feeling down<br/>
There's something's pissin you off<br/>
And something's wrong- you know what<br/>
We're gonna, I'm gonna cheer you up<br/>
I'm gonna help you out<br/>
Just go ahead and just<br/>
And just listen alright?<br/>
Here we go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hi there hey friend how are you<br/>
Cheer on up you superstar you<br/>
Don't let them try you<br/>
Fuck that shit<br/>
Don't let them deny you<br/>
Cause you're gonna make it some day<br/>
And you're gonna make it some way<br/>
No more waitin for the bus<br/>
And no more riding on the subway<br/>
Live life how you want to<br/>
So get on up now go get out there<br/>
Face your fears<br/>
No need to be scared<br/>
You better rebel<br/>
And if they hate you give 'em hell<br/>
No more hiding in your sheeeeell<br/>
Cause we are not defined<br/>
By how hard we fall<br/>
So dust yourself off and stand tall<br/>
Cause you can make it<br/>
Of this I'm sure<br/>
Just spread your wings<br/>
And you will soar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know<br/>
I know, know<br/>
That I'm gonna blow<br/>
You away<br/>
And when I wake up<br/>
I'm gonna shake up<br/>
The fuckin' world<br/>
And you're gonna love me<br/>
You're gonna take me<br/>
As I am (as I am)<br/>
And not a single one of you<br/>
Can tell me no<br/>
Ohhhh yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm a go where nobody before me has gone<br/>
And I know that the journey is gonna be long<br/>
Livin' life like a mademan like a don<br/>
I was in the dark but now with the lights on<br/>
It's real hard on the rise to fame<br/>
Cause everybody's mad and you're the one to blame<br/>
And just last year you didn't know my name - Logic<br/>
Now they all demand it<br/>
Used to hate me and I can't stand it<br/>
Cause now you love me you so damn manic<br/>
Said I'll never make it said I'll fail<br/>
My shit was simple<br/>
Motherfucker I sell<br/>
I know I'm gonna prevail<br/>
Eyes on the prize right on my trail<br/>
Middle finger to the haters that are on my tail<br/>
Cause I got heart boy I got spunk<br/>
Feelin' just like Jordan before the dunk<br/>
And if you fuck around I'm a put you in the trunk<br/>
{Ha} I'm just playin around<br/>
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)<br/>
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)<br/>
Oooowwwwww<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know<br/>
I know know<br/>
That I'm gonna blow<br/>
You away<br/>
And when I wake up<br/>
I'm gonna shake up<br/>
The fuckin' world<br/>
And you're gonna love me<br/>
You're gonna take me<br/>
As I am (as I am)<br/>
And not a single one of you<br/>
Can tell me no<br/>
Ohhhhh yeaaa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I swear to God that I love the life I live<br/>
And I'm grateful for every breathe it gives<br/>
I remember thinkin' something's got to give<br/>
New day but it all just feels the same<br/>
No clouds but I can feel the rain<br/>
Pointin' fingers lookin' for someone to blame (lookin' for someone to blame)<br/>
'Til I came across my own name<br/>
I wasn't in control of my destiny<br/>
Feelin' empty thinkin where's the rest of me<br/>
I gotta make it but I need the recipe<br/>
Only then will I find the best of me<br/>
I didn't wanna listen, didn't give a fuck<br/>
I was so selfish, I was so stuck<br/>
Cleanin up food, for a little buck<br/>
Then I quit that, livin' on luck<br/>
I was so lost, at what cost<br/>
Why be the worker, when you could be the boss<br/>
Still doin' wrong, trynna live right<br/>
Get my mind righteous, man I wanna fight<br/>
Shit gettin tight, man that ain't right<br/>
And my girl left, so I just might<br/>
So I just might<br/>
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh<br/>
Happiness last, and uh<br/>
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa (ss)<br/>
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh<br/>
Happiness last, and uh<br/>
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa (ss)
