<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, feeling like I gotta get it right now<br/>
Moving like a killer in the darkness outta sight now<br/>
On another level, so the devil wanna fight now<br/>
Growing up dirt broke, but it's looking bright now<br/>
Bitches on the pipe now, lick a dick right now<br/>
But I can't fade, taking shots with the sight down<br/>
Uh, yeah I coulda died that day<br/>
But I guess God don't ride that way<br/>
Chillin' in the club, getting high all day<br/>
With a couple bad bitches, I'm a do it my way<br/>
Trippin' by the way that I be livin'<br/>
Everything I got 'em giving<br/>
Why you think they can't do it like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm a get high yeah, yeah, yeah <i>[x4]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
No, I don't smoke, but I'm feeling like<br/>
Maybe getting green'll get a brotha' feeling hella right (Uh)<br/>
Bitches on my dick, but I don't give a damn (Yeah)<br/>
Blowin' up my phone, trynna get the dinner plan<br/>
Back stage with the homies 'bout to get it, man<br/>
Fuck a fifteen minute man<br/>
Look young, but I been a man<br/>
All that ringtone rap, make a brotha' wanna kill a man<br/>
I am just a sinner, man<br/>
Keep it real, yeah, that been the plan<br/>
You know we always do it for the fans<br/>
I be sippin' low key like no ID<br/>
Always in the lab, yes, sir, that's me<br/>
Label that I'm reppin', that's VMG<br/>
From the womb to the tomb, we be keepin' it G (Logic)<br/>
What you know about me?<br/>
Everybody know that I be reppin' that 3-0-1<br/>
Fuck around again, son<br/>
West Deer Park, that's where I'm from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Feeling like I gotta bring it back again<br/>
Always on another level, don't know how to act again<br/>
I be on that real (real), no I never back down<br/>
You don't wanna fuck around<br/>
Busting like a Mac, now<br/>
Started from the bottom, ain't no way I'm a go back down<br/>
Slack now, all the motherfucker, hell naw, never that now<br/>
Tell me that they love me, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Boy chillin' in the cut bad bitch, far from it, slut<br/>
