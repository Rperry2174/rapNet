<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Various listeners is wishing this death<br/>
Don't give a damn, I'm reppin' Young Sinatra till my last breath<br/>
Easily my darkest confession is lyrical agression<br/>
Through indiscretion that triggers anti-depression<br/>
With addressin' my profession in every session<br/>
The fact that I'm alive is such a blessing<br/>
Sippin' wine while these honeys undressin'<br/>
What I'm about to say is highly confidential<br/>
And in the music industry today, very essential<br/>
So bust out your pencil, you can do it on your own<br/>
Stop thinking that these labels is the ones that put you on<br/>
Let's change the topic, Who's your favorite rapper?<br/>
I'm the top pick, ha<br/>
The flow is elegant, never irrelevant<br/>
How many times must I say this?<br/>
Cock back and spray this, never delay this<br/>
I pray this, reaches the masses<br/>
And spread like cancer on they asses<br/>
Now, allow me to catch wreck, bust rhymes like tech<br/>
Put me in your box and I destroy the deck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
(Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
Swear to God I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
(Uh, uh, uh yeah, yo)<br/>
Whipin' through Cabo with a Murcielago<br/>
Dodging paparazzi with the finest dime I met in Chicago<br/>
The baddest Bobby soxer that you ever seen, reppin' my team<br/>
We real all the time, so my squad keen, bing<br/>
Dave, it's me Sinatra and my boy Dean<br/>
The way we (winning) I can't believe there isn't a Sheen<br/>
And pregnant women listen and they give birth to a fiend<br/>
I spit narcotic epidemic all up in your genes<br/>
In layman's terms I disperse your verse, you ever seen<br/>
Assassinate rappers the moment that they intervene<br/>
While you in the alley playing dice<br/>
I'm in the yacht contemplating plans for the next diamond heist<br/>
All thieves and jewel connoisseurs<br/>
I study every part of they mind and make my rhyme better than yours<br/>
Elevated by being hated, sleeping on the brother like they heavily sedated<br/>
Some say I'm one in a million, I say I'm one of a kind<br/>
Only cocky when I rhyme, I'm Muhammad in his prime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
(Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
Swear to God I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yo, Address the mic and start spillin' like I hit the vein<br/>
Back in the day they used to sleep on me like Tryptophan<br/>
Touchdown now the city screamin' my name<br/>
I flow gunshots and break fingers just to shift the pane<br/>
The weather, hate em', I levitate em' like David Blaine<br/>
Black Ops state of mind, play the game like campaign<br/>
Bumpin' Santana in a finest cope of Cabana<br/>
In Havannah with a honey by the name of Hannah<br/>
Wearing nothing but a bandana<br/>
Pussy wetter than Louisiana<br/>
You know the deal, piece the milk bone, I keep it real<br/>
Flyer than a man of steel, motherfucker how you feel, It's Logic
