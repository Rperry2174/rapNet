<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Seem like my whole life changed in the last year<br/>
At parties with legends like "what the fuck I'm doing here?"<br/>
Waiting for someone to say "what the fuck you doing here?"<br/>
Until I realized that I belonged, had nothing to fear<br/>
Who would've thought I would mingle with celebrity singles<br/>
In a room full of Grammy winners discussing they singles<br/>
Some people love you, some people hate you, some people need you<br/>
Some people act like they know you but they can't even read you<br/>
The effort I put into music still the same amount<br/>
Cause ain't a damn thing changed 'cept the bank account<br/>
I remember the day I got my advance money<br/>
I'm talkin so much bread, this shit will make you dance money<br/>
It was the first thing I did, got my team out the way and then I got myself a crib<br/>
My boy Lenny gave me a place to stay for a year<br/>
Put food in my stomach, I had nothing to fear<br/>
And once that 365 was up, I told him to quit his job and gave him a new career<br/>
So many rappers on that stupid superstar shit<br/>
But I plan to eat with the people I starved with<br/>
I've made money, I've lost money, I've spent money<br/>
I've slept outside due to lack of the rent money<br/>
I've been in love but having been through a lot of pain<br/>
Cause what the fuck is sunshine without a little rain?<br/>
<br/>
And love is like leaves in the fall<br/>
Cause some people get scared and leave and you fall<br/>
Speaking of which, I met this girl the other day<br/>
The type of girl that make the pain fade away<br/>
And I have a feeling she gon' be my next<br/>
Cause she make me forget all about my ex<br/>
I'm talking something that's deeper than just sex<br/>
But I don't want it to be the 3rd letter in the word next<br/>
Always sold in the sea of love<br/>
I'm just not current, none of the above<br/>
And man fuck all that depressing shit<br/>
Let's get this money and fuck these bitches, you know what I'm sayin?<br/>
Sike nah, you all just know that I'm playin<br/>
Cause all the money you possess ain't what makes you a man<br/>
Big shot, tough guy, blow 100 grand<br/>
But you still in the same place, damn<br/>
<br/>
But man the world is so fascinating<br/>
Ambition got these girls gravitating<br/>
And honestly it strokes the ego<br/>
But beautiful women ain't good for nothing except procrastinating<br/>
I got a show in Paris coming up<br/>
Followed by London, I'm a tear it up<br/>
So many people just don't care enough<br/>
Analyzing faces in the crowd staring up<br/>
What's the difference between me and them?<br/>
How come I ain't in the crowd at they show seeing them?<br/>
What do guys see in me that he ain't see in them?<br/>
Cause honestly I see no difference between me and them<br/>
We all people, all equal, we all the same<br/>
Lookin for control tryna play the game<br/>
We all got issues, just different magazines<br/>
We all sleep but have different dreams<br/>
However once you're awake and you life ain't what it seems<br/>
And that's the reason I'm living within my own dream<br/>
<br/>
Hell yea, fuck 'em all, like I'm runnin from you the law<br/>
Haters probably think they faze me, I'm like nuh uh, not at all<br/>
I'm too high up, not to fall<br/>
Like a sphere, bitch I ball<br/>
Never ask me where my team at 'cause you know I brought em all<br/>
And if you're looking for a problem then we can get it solved<br/>
I just kill them with kindness, keep the peace and it dissolve<br/>
You got bitches, I got Bobby Soxer girls that be ride or die<br/>
A shawty on another level, let me catch a vibe<br/>
Super bad girl, IQ is in the sky<br/>
She graduated cum laude, yo bitch went to DeVry<br/>
God damn, oh girl, she a go getta<br/>
At the party takin shots like a Beretta<br/>
Doing anything and everything to feel better<br/>
And now she in the crib getting high like a falsetto<br/>
How you feeling, I be yelling, "why these motherfuckers grilling?"<br/>
And she give me life 'cause I'm making a killing<br/>
Bring it down, do it slow, show me how that really go<br/>
Girl I'm new in town, I don't really know<br/>
They be like, when you gonna tell me that you love me?<br/>
I be like bitch I gotta hit the studio, ho<br/>
Now she got me on the crib, talkin that she wanna do it<br/>
Condom on the dresser looking at me like there ain't nothing to it<br/>
Thinking should I do it though<br/>
I don't even know though<br/>
I don't even know the ho<br/>
I don't even know though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Elijah Blake:]</i><br/>
Say oh oh oh<br/>
Mama I made it<br/>
You cannot tell me no but the young boy made a way<br/>
Oh oh oh<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
I said oh oh oh oh oh
