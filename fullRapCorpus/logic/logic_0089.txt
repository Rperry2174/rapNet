<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tell me how you feel<br/>
I feel like the grass is green<br/>
And everything I do is unseen<br/>
But I know that’s just in my mind<br/>
I know everything is just in my mind<br/>
Do you really wanna to be famous?<br/>
Do you really wanna be a superstar?<br/>
Do you really wanna get dangerous?<br/>
Do you even know where the groupies are?<br/>
Bitches out here be shameless<br/>
And I really wonder where they parents are<br/>
Look around, everything changes<br/>
It feels like I've been buried alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Everything happens for a reason<br/>
People only in your life for seasons<br/>
Word to Aunt Viv<br/>
Death and taxes that’s all we given<br/>
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'<br/>
You can make it work but that still ain't driven<br/>
Give a lot but that still ain't givin<br/>
Livin' life like this ain’t real though<br/>
Every night like this I feel so<br/>
Dead wrong, collision is head on<br/>
My vision is dead and gone<br/>
Perception of right and wrong<br/>
I been here so very long<br/>
Right here in this very song<br/>
Look around everything changes<br/>
Seem like everybody just strangers<br/>
Don’t go outside cause it’s dangerous<br/>
Why everybody wanna be famous<br/>
I’m so OCD if they notice me<br/>
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me<br/>
Man everybody want this shit for free<br/>
Hand out palm up when they get to me<br/>
In my mind no I never let it get to me<br/>
Everybody got a time will it get to me<br/>
V’s up motherfucka that’s victory<br/>
Tell me why what I’m doing ain’t shit to me, damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Buried alive, buried alive<br/>
Will I survive?<br/>
Buried alive<br/>
I gotta know<br/>
I gotta know<br/>
It feels like I’ve been buried alive<br/>
Buried alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Let it breathe<br/>
I'm feelin' this villainous feelin inside of my mind<br/>
Every time that I’m willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams<br/>
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah<br/>
Listen up now<br/>
Love it or hate it, never debate it, you can never degrade it<br/>
While all these other motherfuckers probably thinking<br/>
I made it<br/>
My mind jaded no I never evade it<br/>
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)<br/>
God damn, bring it back now<br/>
Blowin' up like Iraq now<br/>
RattPack put me on the map now<br/>
No we never back down<br/>
Just take my time, I just take my time<br/>
I know, Imma get it like this<br/>
So everyone know that I did it like this<br/>
Yeah, I know<br/>
Imma take my time<br/>
Battle the image inside of my mind<br/>
I know, Imma keep going<br/>
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing<br/>
I know, I'm gonna rise<br/>
Even though I've been buried alive<br/>
Buried alive, will I survive?<br/>
I gotta know<br/>
I gotta know<br/>
It feels like I've been buried alive<br/>
Buried alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Thalia:]</i><br/>
Let it breathe<br/>
Outkast<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest<br/>
The Red Hot Chili Peppers<br/>
And films by Quentin Tarantino<br/>
Were in rotation constantly<br/>
Throughout the duration of this album's creation
