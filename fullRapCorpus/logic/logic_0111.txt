It's 2 bars?<br/>
Aight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Motherfuckers wanna get famous<br/>
Bust guns and get dangerous (dangerous)<br/>
Daddy graduated from Cambridge<br/>
Money talks in every language<br/>
Real recognize that stainless<br/>
Silver spoon what my aim is<br/>
Y'all don't know what that game is<br/>
Y'all don't know what that uh<br/>
Y'all about that fraternity life<br/>
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come, baby girl gon' be about that maternity life<br/>
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and alone that maternity life for eternity life<br/>
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life<br/>
Cause we do what we do<br/>
But hold up let me get it right<br/>
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems<br/>
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them<br/>
Revolve them<br/>
Take care of all of them like this<br/>
I might just go crazy<br/>
All the way<br/>
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away<br/>
But not us<br/>
Mamma and daddy never bought us<br/>
Not a god damn thing but they brought us<br/>
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust<br/>
Outside run around with a gun to bust<br/>
Police looking for every one of us<br/>
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us<br/>
Had a little bit of money in the middle<br/>
Let me hit 'em with a riddle<br/>
If I never had a dark night I might not not not not be the same<br/>
Might not be the...<br/>
<br/>
I know my mind is sober<br/>
But I'm so high, it's over<br/>
I know my mind is sober<br/>
But I'm so high, it's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dria:]</i><br/>
Ay-hey now boy<br/>
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy<br/>
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac<br/>
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town<br/>
South Central with the gat gat gat<br/>
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat<br/>
Get the fuck up off your silver<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average<br/>
They cutthroat yeah they savage<br/>
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)<br/>
One day, I woke up, and said I'm bout to do for the rest of my life<br/>
No question it's right<br/>
Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking at the cop right in front of my eyes<br/>
Living in a world of lies<br/>
Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies<br/>
I said I can't take it<br/>
I remember wondering if I would ever make it<br/>
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident<br/>
I'm getting money for the hell of it<br/>
Never fuck around until the flow celibate<br/>
Speaking for the people like a delegate and when the situation's delicate<br/>
I execute it with the proper etiquette<br/>
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no<br/>
I can't take the time to stop<br/>
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top<br/>
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop<br/>
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in<br/>
While the whole world spin for the dividend<br/>
But I'm in another system<br/>
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em<br/>
Why can't we relax and listen<br/>
Stop spending money on things that glisten<br/>
<br/>
I know my mind is sober<br/>
But I'm so high, its over<br/>
I Know my mind is sober<br/>
But I'm so high, its over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dria:]</i><br/>
Ay-hey now boy<br/>
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy<br/>
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac<br/>
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town<br/>
South Central with the gat gat gat<br/>
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat<br/>
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon
