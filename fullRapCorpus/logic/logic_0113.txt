Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious<br/>
I wonder where is this, hold up<br/>
Get the fuck out my business, show enough<br/>
We roll up then load up<br/>
Just a bastard born in a wedlock<br/>
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock<br/>
Got my sites on deadlock<br/>
Visions of my enemy in a headlock<br/>
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble<br/>
Just a youngin' in trouble<br/>
Took a shot and then made it a double<br/>
Took a shot and then made it a double<br/>
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good<br/>
No one greedy inside my hood<br/>
But a tablespoon of this baking soda gon' make it good, like it should<br/>
That's ignant isn't it<br/>
Hold up now wait, take a look at my pigment<br/>
Tell me again, we can never be kin based on the color of my skin<br/>
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin<br/>
That's a club I don't wanna be in<br/>
My DNA get done integrated<br/>
My God it's innovative<br/>
That's a million miles away from administrative<br/>
I fuckin' hate it, anyway<br/>
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park<br/>
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive<br/>
Police would knock on the door, I would hide<br/>
Then they would talk to me and I would lie<br/>
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45<br/>
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away<br/>
Over down on the driveway<br/>
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade<br/>
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"<br/>
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn<br/>
Now I'm a grown man, oh man<br/>
What the fuck done happened to the plan<br/>
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy<br/>
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep<br/>
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker wide awake on the creep<br/>
Tryna kill you and he will too<br/>
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal<br/>
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel<br/>
My son, my seed<br/>
Watch 'em grown and then watch 'em lead<br/>
Let me proceed, bumpin' that that Californication, by the Red Hot<br/>
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot<br/>
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me<br/>
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jesse Boykins III:]</i><br/>
Follow me to paradise<br/>
Follow, follow me<br/>
Follow me to paradise<br/>
Follow me to paradise<br/>
Follow, follow me<br/>
Follow me to paradise<br/>
<br/>
I remember my life long ago in my adolescence<br/>
I could feel the presence in my residence<br/>
Hesitant even thought it was evident<br/>
I should get the fuck<br/>
I know something is wrong<br/>
Yeah, I know something is wrong<br/>
Feel like my mind gone<br/>
I know I play along, I might drown in this song<br/>
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this<br/>
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice<br/>
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed<br/>
Shit made me been unnoticed, huh, but maybe not<br/>
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious<br/>
So outrageous my age is on my mind<br/>
Walking to work and I go blind<br/>
Sippin' on that Koolaid, gettin' big wig money, that's toup√©e<br/>
Look around and see people with no class, like snow on a school day<br/>
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do<br/>
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu<br/>
Livin' life how I do is crazy<br/>
This shit never amaze me<br/>
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why<br/>
All I know is my mind racing<br/>
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it yeah I be pacing<br/>
Bitch I'm back again<br/>
Been here since way back when, now let that shit begin<br/>
<br/>
This album 2 but this song was written before the first<br/>
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst<br/>
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise<br/>
But it only makes it that much better when I rise<br/>
<br/>
This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it<br/>
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming "I knew it!"<br/>
This is real, so real<br/>
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill<br/>
Most of these people will never hit fruition<br/>
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition<br/>
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle<br/>
All alone with no one to dial<br/>
I'm just a man, I got problems, understand<br/>
This is all I ever wanted, yes I do it for the fans<br/>
And I ain't perfect<br/>
I've questioned if this life was even worth it<br/>
Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface<br/>
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done<br/>
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now<br/>
<br/>
This album 2 but this song was written before the first<br/>
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst<br/>
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise<br/>
But it only makes it that much better when I rise
