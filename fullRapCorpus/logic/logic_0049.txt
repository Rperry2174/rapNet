Yeah; pass the mic before I jack it like gore-tex<br/>
Bust like raw sex, rappers suck like vortex<br/>
The life of a Don- We living like kings, and killing our pawns<br/>
Boy, the seconds it's on – don't know where we going<br/>
I'm flowing and killing this shit from dusk til dawn<br/>
Just had sex with a Middle Eastern girl- The pussy was bomb<br/>
That last line made no sense like these rappers' careers<br/>
But I make dollars, cause I'm all about the fiscal year<br/>
Yeah; you don't like me? I'll conjure up and summon all your fears<br/>
You wanna fight me? I'll woop my own ass before you get here<br/>
Wanna write me? And tell me that my rhymes suck?<br/>
Bitch I don't give a fuck, I'll stab you in the gut, call it a tummy tuck<br/>
You can ask my ex, I bust quicker than two techs<br/>
Caressed by a kid with category 5 tourettes<br/>
In other words I squeeze with ease, dot my I's and cross my T's<br/>
I'm a perfectionist; the lesson is fuck everyone assessing this<br/>
It's hip-hop, not to be taken literally<br/>
However on the light of note I stayed with bills like Hilary<br/>
My flow convects, murder subjects with little respect<br/>
Best protect your neck, before you play my tape better inspect the deck<br/>
Fuck every other rapper forever ever forever since the dawn of time<br/>
Sike- I'm not that much of a dick when I rhyme<br/>
On another level like duplex, bust heads like suplex<br/>
Slaughter MC's then ask who's next...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[C Dot Castro:]</i><br/>
Ey yo my crew next, but you say you next, so I guess we now<br/>
Priceless flow so even If I write it's still a freestyle<br/>
Never busting gats I ain't no gangster put that heat down<br/>
Then go and grab a mic and see if you can fuck with me now<br/>
I got that A plus flow I'm on a roll bitch I can't fail<br/>
Making money with my mind, call that shit a brain sell<br/>
Raise hell, like I'm Satan's daddy while you in here<br/>
Catch me in a tenant caddy with a bitch from Cincinnati<br/>
With the thickest fatty while I hit the gas, you lick it gladly<br/>
With the window down see other bitches blowing kisses at me<br/>
It's a fact that me and Logic rip with vicious rap to list a wrap<br/>
We spittin' crack to keep the fiends, coming back to show world<br/>
Reppin Maryland but I make music for the whole world<br/>
Seduce a chick with lyrics whenever she hear it, it make her toes curl<br/>
So sick I hope I don't hurl, if you love me let me go girl<br/>
Cause no pussy come before my flow, just had to let you know girl<br/>
Spit it so thorough and in depth, I bet I leave in you impressed<br/>
Rattpack be my family, I fuck with y'all no incest<br/>
Only interest is to blow up, and watch they hands go up<br/>
Cause I used to throw shows back then but no one would show up<br/>
I ain't all about the money but I want it homie sho' nuff<br/>
Cause krispie crazy bout' the cream, you could say I'm doughnuts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
I murdered my manager Chris last night<br/>
We exchanged a couple words, he said some things I didn't like<br/>
I said okay... then punched him in the face with a butcher knife<br/>
I want more like Ashton Kutcher's wife<br/>
Now can you feel it? They won't {Sinatra}<br/>
Gimme what I want, so fuck it I'm a steal it<br/>
I'll dilapidate you, grab the butter knife and decapitate you<br/>
Yeah that's what I said – huh, and bitch I did it<br/>
We all have thoughts like this; I'm just willing to admit it<br/>
I would never act upon these thoughts now, don't you get it?<br/>
It's like when a gentleman sees the baddest bitch and thinks, "I'd hit it!"<br/>
But he never says it; I'll dump your body in a dessert<br/>
It's the wrath of a psychopath clutching a razor blade in a bath<br/>
Having his last laugh, anticipating a gash- the other night I murdered captain crunch<br/>
Right in front of Toucan Sam and a whole damn bunch<br/>
That's life, what can I say? I'm a cereal killer, venereal dealer<br/>
And yes you know they ain't none other iller<br/>
It's Logic.
