<i>[Verse 1 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Back again like I never left<br/>
Young Sinatra, that's to the death<br/>
We turnt up 'til we go deaf<br/>
Rep RattPack 'til my last breath<br/>
I cut records like Kid Cudi<br/>
Day and night, that's all the time<br/>
From the underground to the mainstream<br/>
My same team get all the shine<br/>
They wanted beef but I never knew<br/>
I just keep the peace and get revenue<br/>
Stay true, they never do<br/>
Cut all ties, I'll sever you<br/>
These rappers like women, that's off of their pill<br/>
We keeping it real but they flow is irregular<br/>
Grab the mic and I murder on the regular<br/>
While these bitches hit me up on my cellular<br/>
I can't take the time that I take to rhyme<br/>
And just bullshit, man, that blow my mind<br/>
I'm 23 like MJ<br/>
That's no rest like overtime<br/>
Writing rhymes on the tour bus<br/>
We stay real to the core of us<br/>
They talk shit 'bout RattPack<br/>
But every day, man, there's more of us<br/>
That money come and that money go<br/>
But this music shit, man, that's all I know<br/>
I been broke and I got paid<br/>
Like a Goodfella that got made<br/>
I'm draped up and I'm dripped out<br/>
Went to school, got kicked out<br/>
Told my mama, she flipped out<br/>
Said “fuck it all” and I dipped out<br/>
But I'm back though, whole time<br/>
Fuck bitches, I just rhyme<br/>
Brand new state of mind<br/>
My lifestyle is so divine<br/>
Cause I've lived and I've learned<br/>
Now I hustle and earn<br/>
Cause once you in the limelight, everybody concerned<br/>
With your wellbeing, and if you feel okay<br/>
Bitch, you wasn't here a year ago<br/>
Why are you here today?<br/>
I've got professor paper, your money need an extension<br/>
I'm selling success, save up and pay attention<br/>
Money can't buy happiness, but that shit can support it<br/>
Cause what's a family of five if you can't even afford it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Dizzy Wright:]</i><br/>
Feeling good, feeling great<br/>
Feeling like a XXL Freshman on your bitch ass, nigga<br/>
Creeping on the come-up with my nigga Logic<br/>
Time to get it popping<br/>
Got your city watching, hit the stage, them titties popping<br/>
What it do? Bruh, I fuck with you<br/>
Don't let these haters knock ya<br/>
Keep it gangsta, keep it, keep it G<br/>
Don't keep them lames around<br/>
And fuck the world, fuck the, fuck the world<br/>
Y'all gon' feel my passion (pass the blunt)<br/>
I'mma create that shit that's fuckin' everlasting<br/>
And I'm overboard with the tactics<br/>
Walk out the house and I ain't even matching<br/>
But I'm stunting cause I'm the coolest and the youngest<br/>
I told ‘em I was a threat, they scared of what's next<br/>
I'm Christoper Dorner in effect if you speakin' down on my name<br/>
Walking down this road, I'm the only one in my lane<br/>
And my fingers getting itchy, that's that money coming to get me<br/>
Mr. Wright, Mr. Dizzy Wright, Vegas nigga shit (making noise)<br/>
Wait a minute, ain't them niggas on the list?<br/>
Making moves, making super moves, who the fuck is you?<br/>
Nigga what? Nigga, nigga, what? Them niggas the truth<br/>
It's an honor to be a part of the heart of the young Sinatra<br/>
You ain't gotta smoke weed, we gon' celebrate with this vodka<br/>
Grinding for some time, and I'm hella straight with the dollars<br/>
So if you call me and you need me, then I've got ya<br/>
Don't talk about being the realest, niggas gon' feel us regardless<br/>
We gotta keep on killing, I've got the mind of Martian<br/>
I'm spaced out somewhere in a world where I've never been<br/>
Living out my dreams and I'm still tryna settle in<br/>
See it's amazing, studio sessions, beautiful blessings<br/>
I'm faded, usually quiet, but I've got this message<br/>
So I speak it like I know it<br/>
Got my shot, I took it and I didn't fuckin' blow it<br/>
Now everything is in motion<br/>
Calling out my homies who understand what it means<br/>
To get off your ass, get on your grind and follow your dreams<br/>
Making it a fact to be great at what you achieve<br/>
If I lead, would you follow with a ease?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Open your mind, elevate to the level of this rhyme<br/>
Keep it G to the dime, many seek, never find<br/>
Never knowing when I'm flowing, feeling heroic, never ask<br/>
Chilling with your bitch, I can't help but grab up on that ass<br/>
Swerving at 120 while she's rolling weed on the dash<br/>
Many never follow their dreams but follow the cash<br/>
And this is the reason the Reaper is coming for they ass<br/>
Top dollar, money, bitches, Impalas<br/>
Fuck it all, let me holler<br/>
And show you how we do it where I come from<br/>
We getting money for the long term, not just no lump sum<br/>
How you feeling?<br/>
Make a killing, bitches higher than the ceiling<br/>
I'm Goku, you fuckers is Krillin with the spirit bomb<br/>
Fuck around, throw your body on the lawn<br/>
Right in front of your mom, motherfuckers, I'm gone<br/>
RattPack
