<i>[Thomas &amp; Kai:]</i><br/>
"Okay so what do you think life was like before the fall?<br/>
I mean we've seen pictures of open land as far as the eye can see<br/>
and oceans incomprehensible in size that our grandparents would do their best to describe it.<br/>
I just can't imagine life anywhere but inside a space station.<br/>
I mean the simple concept of a sky doesn't even fully register."<br/>
<br/>
"We do have fields on the Babel station and also..."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah yeah but that's all synthetic, I mean were heading to this planet right?<br/>
That we call "Paradise" because we hope it can sustain life why?"<br/>
<br/>
"Because we'll eventually run out of resources."<br/>
<br/>
"Exactly I mean what if we got there and it's exactly as the data predicted beautiful, lush.<br/>
Then we destroy it just like we did Earth. There's only 5 million human beings left in the universe.<br/>
I mean it's weird to think about the fact that in 2065 the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel."<br/>
<br/>
"Man what's your point?"<br/>
<br/>
"The point is 30 ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this,<br/>
damn near all of them return without any luck some of them didn't return at all.<br/>
I guess my fear isn't that we won't find paradise... It's that we'll create purgatory."
