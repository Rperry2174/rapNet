<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
I've been on the low<br/>
I been taking my time<br/>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<br/>
It feel like my life ain't mine<br/>
Who can relate?<br/>
I've been on the low<br/>
I been taking my time<br/>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<br/>
It feel like my life ain't mine<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna be alive<br/>
I don't wanna be alive<br/>
I just wanna die today<br/>
I just wanna die<br/>
I don't wanna be alive<br/>
I don't wanna be alive<br/>
I just wanna die<br/>
And let me tell you why<br/>
<br/>
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it<br/>
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic<br/>
And my life don't even matter<br/>
I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it<br/>
I never had a place to call my own<br/>
I never had a home<br/>
Ain't nobody callin' my phone<br/>
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?<br/>
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine<br/>
<br/>
I've been on the low<br/>
I been taking my time<br/>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<br/>
It feel like my life ain't mine<br/>
Who can relate?<br/>
I've been on the low<br/>
I been taking my time<br/>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<br/>
It feel like my life ain't mine<br/>
<br/>
I want you to be alive<br/>
I want you to be alive<br/>
You don't gotta die today<br/>
You don't gotta die<br/>
I want you to be alive<br/>
I want you to be alive<br/>
You don't gotta die<br/>
Now lemme tell you why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alessia Cara:]</i><br/>
It's the very first breath<br/>
When your head's been drowning underwater<br/>
And it's the lightness in the air<br/>
When you're there<br/>
Chest to chest with a lover<br/>
It's holding on, though the road's long<br/>
And seeing light in the darkest things<br/>
And when you stare at your reflection<br/>
Finally knowing who it is<br/>
I know that you'll thank God you did<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'<br/>
I know you're the reason I believe in life<br/>
What's the day without a little night?<br/>
I'm just tryna shed a little light<br/>
It can be hard<br/>
It can be so hard<br/>
But you gotta live right now<br/>
You got everything to give right now<br/>
<br/>
I've been on the low<br/>
I been taking my time<br/>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<br/>
It feel like my life ain't mine<br/>
Who can relate?<br/>
I've been on the low<br/>
I been taking my time<br/>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<br/>
It feel like my life ain't mine<br/>
<br/>
I finally wanna be alive<br/>
I finally wanna be alive<br/>
I don't wanna die today<br/>
I don't wanna die<br/>
I finally wanna be alive<br/>
I finally wanna be alive<br/>
I don't wanna die<br/>
I don't wanna die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Khalid:]</i><br/>
Pain don't hurt the same, I know<br/>
The lane I travel feels alone<br/>
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out<br/>
And I see my tears melt in the snow<br/>
But I don't wanna cry<br/>
I don't wanna cry anymore<br/>
I wanna feel alive<br/>
I don't even wanna die anymore<br/>
Oh I don't wanna<br/>
I don't wanna<br/>
I don't even wanna die anymore
