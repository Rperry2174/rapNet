<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood<br/>
Been looking for holy water, now I'm praying for a flood<br/>
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug<br/>
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug<br/>
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?<br/>
Tell me you love me, need me<br/>
Promise me you'll never leave me<br/>
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street<br/>
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete<br/>
Tell white people I'm black, feel the need to retreat<br/>
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik<br/>
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters want to act like I'm adopted<br/>
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it<br/>
<br/>
Oh my<br/>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<br/>
Ohhh<br/>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<br/>
Oh my<br/>
<br/>
Somebody pinch me<br/>
Black man screaming, trying to convince me<br/>
I'm not black, So why the white man wanna lynch me?<br/>
Damn, my skin fair but life's not<br/>
And I be lying if I said I didn't care what whites thought<br/>
Or black people said, shit<br/>
Maybe it's in my head like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<br/>
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her<br/>
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her<br/>
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her<br/>
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater<br/>
Wondering what's gonna happen<br/>
And how the world gonna treat her<br/>
How could her momma mislead her<br/>
And her daddy just leave her?<br/>
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever<br/>
Oh my<br/>
<br/>
Oh my<br/>
Like the white women said oh my<br/>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<br/>
Ohhh<br/>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<br/>
Oh my<br/>
I don't feel right deep inside<br/>
Feeling like I need to hide<br/>
Everybody wonder why I get high<br/>
Cause I can't fight the feeling inside<br/>
Oh my, my, my<br/>
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence<br/>
And all this shit is so intense<br/>
Don't wanna go to this event<br/>
Just wanna stay home and invent<br/>
And sometimes, yeah, that let me vent<br/>
I'm taking shots and drinking liquor<br/>
But that shit don't make a dent in how I'm feeling<br/>
And yes I'm willing to keep chilling on this shit<br/>
I know there is someone out there far away<br/>
Who's feeling all this shit<br/>
And yes I know that when I'm low<br/>
There's so much further I can go<br/>
And so I look up to the sky<br/>
Oh my, oh my<br/>
<br/>
Oh my<br/>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<br/>
Ohhh<br/>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood<br/>
Been looking for holy water, now I'm praying for a flood<br/>
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug<br/>
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug<br/>
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?<br/>
Tell me you love me, need me<br/>
Promise me you'll never leave me<br/>
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street<br/>
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete<br/>
Tell white people I'm black, feel the need to retreat<br/>
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik<br/>
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters want to act like I'm adopted<br/>
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it<br/>
My oh my<br/>
My oh my<br/>
Like the white women said oh my<br/>
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<br/>
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her<br/>
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her<br/>
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her<br/>

Oh my, my, my<br/>
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I can't get you out of my mind<br/>
Baby no I just can't find, I just can't find<br/>
Such a beautiful state of mind<br/>
State of mind, state of mind<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes everyday right on time<br/>
But right now on my mind<br/>
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time<br/>
<br/>
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood<br/>
Been looking for holy water, now I'm praying for a flood<br/>
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug<br/>

Oh my<br/>
<br/>
So what now?<br/>
What advice can you give me?<br/>
What advice can I give humanity? I suppose so<br/>
Live your life<br/>
Don't waste your days on the negative energy of others<br/>
Remember that you're not your salary<br/>
You're not your house you're not your car<br/>
And no matter how big your bank account is<br/>
Your grave is six feet under just like everyone else's<br/>
So enjoy the days you have<br/>
Worry not bout the days that came before you<br/>
Nor the ones that will follow you in death<br/>
Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed<br/>
And the fact that you are living is what life is all about<br/>
So live your life to the fullest<br/>
According to your happiness and the betterment of all<br/>
Damn man we've been walking forever<br/>
Well Thalias tracking system says we'll be there in just over an hour<br/>
Shit at least we got good walking music or is that it?<br/>
Oh no man I'm cueing up the fourth album now, his final one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
1, 2, 3, 4<br/>
1, 2, 3, 4 listen<br/>
Look into my eyes<br/>
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on<br/>
This front that I'm puttin' up for you<br/>
I spill my soul into a microphone<br/>
With poems written in blood<br/>
In hopes that it's enough for you<br/>
Do you love me yet?<br/>
Do you love me yet?<br/>
No, okay<br/>
I'll go harder for you<br/>
In fact, I rap till I collapse<br/>
All I wanted was acceptance<br/>
My latest lesson<br/>
I'll never feel your approval until I accept my own<br/>
Come from a messed up home<br/>
Destitute and less informed<br/>
About the ways to raise a child up<br/>
To not become a product<br/>
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent<br/>
But I done built this wall up<br/>
Actin' like everything's all good<br/>
But in reality I'm lookin' for something<br/>
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after<br/>
Nas, Cole and Hov<br/>
Eyes closed I zone till 5 or so in the morn<br/>
I'm used to being alone<br/>
Shit you know how long I've been out on my own<br/>
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne<br/>
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along<br/>
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant<br/>
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in<br/>
And still then<br/>
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?<br/>
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap<br/>
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved<br/>
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs<br/>
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit<br/>
Be who you are, identify as a star<br/>
No one tells you you're that<br/>
It's something that you just know<br/>
The world be stealing your glow<br/>
Your mama did what she could<br/>
Her life was miles from good<br/>
Your father fell in the trap<br/>
They set for you when you're black<br/>
They met when they was low<br/>
And therefore you a product of that<br/>
And so your trauma is deep<br/>
Don't bury it you should weep<br/>
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em<br/>
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace<br/>
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release<br/>
I've been through it before<br/>
Can only share with you what I know<br/>
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you<br/>
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try<br/>
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you could fly<br/>
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky<br/>
But if you want to then you ought to know why<br/>
Are you running from something<br/>
With hopes of becoming someone<br/>
That's finally worthy of love<br/>
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough<br/>
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell<br/>
Find God learn to accept yourself<br/>
And I'm gone<br/>
Accept him
