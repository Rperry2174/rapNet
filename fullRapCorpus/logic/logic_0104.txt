Aye, this that shit<br/>
I'm looking at you 6ix<br/>
I've been feeling like a<br/>
<br/>
I've been feeling like a mothafuckin' postman<br/>
Sending letters to the people<br/>
All this knowledge that I got, I'm like an old man<br/>
Hold up, wait now oh man!<br/>
Let me back up in this bitch<br/>
I'm platinum in this bitch, I'm rapping in this bitch<br/>
Running the game, yeah I've been lappin' in this bitch<br/>
You know it's alright<br/>
Fuck around and they all might<br/>
Look at a brother different, I've been at it all night<br/>
I think I said it but I know I do it, this for everybody going through it<br/>
<br/>
Like woah<br/>
Through it like woah<br/>
Through it like woah<br/>
Going through it like woah<br/>
You already know<br/>
You already know<br/>
Gotta get it like woah<br/>
In this bitch like woah<br/>
Get it like, like, like woah<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Uh, I'ma get it like woah<br/>
<br/>
Back up in this mothafucka livin' like a goddamn king<br/>
Tell me money ain't a thing now<br/>
30 thousand feet above the world right next to the wing<br/>
Too high to hear the birds sing now<br/>
All around the world and back again it's finally happenin'<br/>
I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house<br/>
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side<br/>
Bringin' out my best side<br/>
I was on the road for like a quarter I was in and out the border<br/>
From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary<br/>
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry<br/>
Should've seen the itinerary, then we made it back home like woah<br/>
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'<br/>
I know I've been illin'<br/>
Probably wonder where I'm at, bitch I've been chillin'<br/>
Why they grillin'? Yeah I'm still in like I never left<br/>
They know I had to go but then I brought it right back<br/>
<br/>
Like woah<br/>
Do it like woah<br/>
Do it like woah<br/>
Going through it like woah<br/>
You already know<br/>
You already know<br/>
Gotta get it like woah<br/>
In this bitch like woah<br/>
Get it like, like, like woah<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Uh, I'ma get it like woah<br/>
<br/>
I get so high they wonder why no I can't go away<br/>
I gotta hold my own, know that's the only way<br/>
I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know<br/>
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go<br/>
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute<br/>
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite<br/>
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb<br/>
I'ma be here 'til the tomb<br/>
Lately I've been in my room<br/>
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall<br/>
Hold up<br/>
<br/>
Like woah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[William Kai:]</i><br/>
Yeah I hope we make it to fuckin' paradise and not fuckin' die on the way there, mothafucka
