<i>[Intro - Renee Soul]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vocals]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Logic]</i><br/>
Listen<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Look<br/>
I wish there wasn't no system<br/>
I wish death on almost every other politician<br/>
I wish freedom for all my brothers stuck in prison<br/>
I wish people weren't led by the television<br/>
I wish the kids turned against the media<br/>
Don’t believe everything you read on Wikipedia<br/>
Africa I wish that we were feeding ya and not raping ya wealth<br/>
I wish that people thought about somebody else before themself<br/>
Listen, then maybe then we’d all live good B<br/>
If you need it then I got that the way it should be<br/>
Life’s nowhere near where it could be<br/>
Sometimes I wish that I was Lowkey and they come and took me<br/>
Cause I feel kinda bad in my heart cause I feel the first bang so it’s hard yeah we bust case<br/>
iTunes number 1 yeah forget paves<br/>
Forget any of the offers that the labels make<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Renee Soul]</i><br/>
I wish<br/>
I wish that all my wrongs were right<br/>
And I wish<br/>
I wish that I could change my life<br/>
So my kids<br/>
Would never have to sacrifice<br/>
Like I did<br/>
So I give<br/>
And they live<br/>
People have to realize<br/>
That we live<br/>
We’re living in some crazy times<br/>
And I wish<br/>
I wish that we would all unite<br/>
And I wish<br/>
I wish I wish I wish<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Logic]</i><br/>
I wish for peace in every country<br/>
I wish for a stress-less life for my mummy<br/>
I wish that no kid went hungry<br/>
Cause trust me, if I had enough money<br/>
I’d fill up every hungry kid’s tummy<br/>
I wish that money gets abolished<br/>
So anyone can give everything to their kids never can’t afford it<br/>
I wish the whole world was able to live lawless<br/>
I wish that there wasn't no such thing as being the poorest<br/>
I wish we didn't know what more is<br/>
I wish that everyone saw everyone as beautiful and gorgeous<br/>
I wish for a lot of things<br/>
I wish that I was young and I still played for Kennington Kings<br/>
Look, I don’t wish for the fame or the glamour<br/>
I wish for everyone to understand us<br/>
See what I really wish for will probably never be<br/>
I wish Africa and Palestine were free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Renee Soul]</i><br/>
I wish<br/>
I wish that all my wrongs were right<br/>
And I wish<br/>
I wish that I could change my life<br/>
So my kids<br/>
Would never have to sacrifice<br/>
Like I did<br/>
So I give<br/>
And they live<br/>
People have to realize<br/>
That we live<br/>
We’re living in some crazy times<br/>
And I wish<br/>
I wish that we would all unite<br/>
And I wish<br/>
I wish I wish I wish<br/>
<i>[Vocals]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lowkey]</i><br/>
I wish I could see freedom for the Irish<br/>
And I wish you could see deeper than my iris<br/>
As I write this I wish<br/>
People would define it in a way that wasn't dictated by dividers and conquerors<br/>
Tell us conscious is what our genre is<br/>
You think their dominance is monstrous<br/>
But a bomb isn't stronger than a continent<br/>
Tell us we’re incompetent<br/>
That’s nonsense we’re just onto them<br/>
My confidence is shocking them<br/>
Not all open hands and open mouths<br/>
Dry your tears cause the pioneers of global south<br/>
That is why we’re here<br/>
Never will I appear on Oprah’s couch<br/>
Only in the press when the feds put my photo out<br/>
They wonder why the mad and young are grabbing guns (Why?)<br/>
But you could speak with your hands if you didn’t have a tongue<br/>
Even that’s better than sitting down sad and numb<br/>
At times I wish I was Gaberlunzie and I was about to have a son<br/>
Scratch that had a baby girl<br/>
Live twice and bring life to this crazy world<br/>
Be on rap congrats for the new arrival<br/>
I’m stuck in Britain accustomed to living suicidal<br/>
But not for much longer<br/>
I realize that our culture is a weapon<br/>
And nowadays I’m much stronger<br/>
Simply to exist is what I wish<br/>
Retirement or not what I have written is timeless
