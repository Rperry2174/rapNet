<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hold up, let me get my mind right<br/>
Let me get my mind right<br/>
You know everything is alright<br/>
You know everything is all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Just ride with a mothafucka<br/>
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucker hold me down<br/>
Chillin' in a-gadda-da-vida, rockin' Adidas<br/>
With a senorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter<br/>
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino<br/>
He know we be in the casino lightin' Cubans with a C-note<br/>
I'm a fuck the game, dare you to test my libido<br/>
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito whenever I step on the beat, ho<br/>
Like a killer on the creep slow<br/>
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho<br/>
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though<br/>
Wonderin' if I'm a ever fall off<br/>
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit her with the sawed off<br/>
Blowin' up like a molotov<br/>
This is war everybody ain't no reason I'm a call it off<br/>
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright<br/>
In the studio everyday so you know this shit about to be a busy night<br/>
Everything is all, everything is alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
It's finally famous over everything<br/>
Rattpack gang<br/>
What up though Logic, yeah<br/>
Day one shit right there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Oh my God they plottin' and schemin'<br/>
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'<br/>
They tryna take my blessins away<br/>
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday<br/>
And I'm blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well<br/>
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'<br/>
And I get to sit back and say that I'm happy<br/>
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'<br/>
Got champagne problems And I order more, of my wardrobe is aura gold<br/>
I'm a young nigga with a older soul<br/>
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more<br/>
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician<br/>
She doin' tricks with the pussy, I guess she's a vagician<br/>
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up<br/>
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up<br/>
Hype nigga back-back-back it up<br/>
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop<br/>
That's the type of shit I boycott<br/>
Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops<br/>
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts<br/>
I got these good girls hoin' out<br/>
Tell me what the fuck you know about<br/>
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about<br/>
Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out<br/>
Now everything is alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Rippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off 'em<br/>
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin<br/>
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane<br/>
Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' cause I'm into the game<br/>
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same<br/>
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela<br/>
Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella<br/>
Ain't nobody better do it like me<br/>
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me<br/>
Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace<br/>
No need to keep a piece<br/>
I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?<br/>
And keep it real for the people I reach!
