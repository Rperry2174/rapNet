<i>[Hook: Lykke Li]</i><br/>
Watch my back, so I make sure<br/>
You're right behind me as before<br/>
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow<br/>
Dry my eyes so you won't know<br/>
Dry my eyes so I won't show<br/>
I know you're right behind me...<br/>
<br/>
Won't you let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Won't you let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Won't you let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Won't you let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Won't you let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Won't you let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I know we seen a lot of shit in the time we've been together<br/>
Thought we knew it all but couldn't predict the weather<br/>
I think about you and imagine a house and some kids<br/>
I wonder if you found another and it's all his<br/>
See baby girl, I know you love me even through the lies<br/>
Cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes<br/>
Sometimes I see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl I know you hear it<br/>
My heart is calling for you tonight<br/>
And even though the time is wrong I know the love is right<br/>
That's why there's so much emotion when I recite<br/>
Anything about this angel that lost it's sight<br/>
Baby you were my everything, but you playing games<br/>
Fucking around got me feeling like blowing my brains<br/>
But you ain't worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action<br/>
I used to count the days with you but now I just subtract them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Lykke Li]</i><br/>
Let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
Let me go, let me go tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You were my best friend but then you out me<br/>
I never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me<br/>
So in the end it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me<br/>
I know you hearing the emotion that's deep in this letter but I don't give a shit about what you think<br/>
I write it so that the people can feel better that I've gone through what I've gone through<br/>
Memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you<br/>
And if you think I write this song to taunt you<br/>
I don't want you, I want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday<br/>
And have an endless love with an angel from up above<br/>
But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen<br/>
And another path within my life is calling<br/>
Cause I put everything below you, (everything below you)<br/>
Even my music, and when you left me I didn't lose it<br/>
I channeled deep within emotions and used it<br/>
My heart you broke it and bruised it<br/>
So now I address this microphone and just ooze it<br/>
<br/>
