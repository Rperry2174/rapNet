Step into the mind of a young man<br/>
And if you don't then I don't really give a damn<br/>
All I really wanna do is make you understand<br/>
But if you don't wanna listen I guess you ain't apart of the plan<br/>
Sorry if I digress all I ever wanted was to be the best<br/>
Through lyricism to put your mind to the test<br/>
Staying up late night no rest<br/>
Feelin' bullet proof, no vest<br/>
But I confess my minds a mess living in world of stress I digest<br/>
But I gotta keep grinding cause everyday success what I'm finding<br/>
And I don't give a damn if you hate on me<br/>
Cause when I blow what you gone say homie huh<br/>
Not a God damn thing<br/>
But that's enough of that I'll let my home girl sing<br/>
<br/>
Knocked down round for round<br/>
You're feeling like your shot down<br/>
On the ground<br/>
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)<br/>
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Knocked down round for round<br/>
You're feeling like your shot down<br/>
On the ground<br/>
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)<br/>
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
All I think about is music<br/>
Don't get me wrong I think of other things but this how I fuse it<br/>
So the whole wide world can use it<br/>
When you feel like you just might lose it take a breath home don't confuse it<br/>
Take a step in the Mind Of Logic<br/>
As long as you don't abuse it<br/>
So let me break it down for the whole world<br/>
Like I broke it down for my old girl<br/>
I cannot deal with your bullshit no more<br/>
Gotta let it go let it unfurl<br/>
Cause I remember the time<br/>
When I was living sublime wanted to make a living off of my rhymes<br/>
But the whole world told me never mind<br/>
I'm a star how could I not shine?<br/>
<br/>
Knocked down round for round<br/>
You're feeling like your shot down<br/>
On the ground<br/>
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)<br/>
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Knocked down round for round<br/>
You're feeling like your shot down<br/>
On the ground<br/>
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)<br/>
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna take it to another level that I've never even been on<br/>
So I can sit on every single piece of paper that I put a pen on<br/>
And when I been on for like 10 year I'm gonna do it better then anyone ever before me<br/>
So the whole wide world will adore me and no need to assure me<br/>
And why you wonder why I'm rapping so fast it cause I gotta lot of things on my mind<br/>
That wanna come out at the same time<br/>
In other words I'm racing I used to pursuit my dreams which are now a reality<br/>
And that's what I'm chasing, why are we on this earth? Why must we feel pain?<br/>
Why does everybody feel the need to judge one another when were all the same<br/>
<br/>
Knocked down round for round<br/>
You're feeling like your shot down<br/>
On the ground<br/>
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)<br/>
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Knocked down round for round<br/>
You're feeling like your shot down<br/>
On the ground<br/>
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)<br/>
When will the Heaven begin? (Yeah)
