I am literally in the air, right now, rapping up a stewardess<br/>
First class, I am so new at this<br/>
Used to ride the metro, now they say that's retro<br/>
Like the infrareds on my feet, baby let's go<br/>
Sinatra what the know me by, Logic what they call me<br/>
Gotta catch a flight but the fans wanna stall me<br/>
Life of a don, chain just glowin', always in the lab with the fresh kicks on<br/>
I'm at the MGM, rocking MCM, Bobby Soxer in my home it's only 10 PM<br/>
Got the Rattpack with me going HAM at the hotel<br/>
Name brand everything fuck a wholesale<br/>
No, I am not materialistic<br/>
I was broke my whole life, and no I don't miss it<br/>
Last 7 years of my life was in a lab<br/>
Working everyday giving it everything I had<br/>
Now that a brother is finally recognized<br/>
I will not let the limelight hypnotize<br/>
Everybody be sure, I'm a always want more<br/>
Does anybody make real shit anymore?<br/>
<br/>
The grind never stops, like I'm running from the cops<br/>
It's hard to stay humble when you're force-fed props<br/>
But I don't give a damn, I am just a man<br/>
I am not more important than any one of my fans<br/>
First name Bobby so I'm all about The Hundreds<br/>
Work so hard errybody think I'm blunted (hah)<br/>
Gunning hard with the mask and Glock<br/>
And I'm a stay with extra clips 'till the casket drops<br/>
Finna blow in the next three years, tops<br/>
Talking worldwide, not just hip-hop<br/>
Rappers now-a-days so flip-flop<br/>
Talking 'bout you, wanna work<br/>
Motherfucker kick rocks<br/>
I am on the come up, headed to the top<br/>
Repping MD, and never will I stop<br/>
Me and the crew V's up, Visionary what it do<br/>
Step to the mic, lyricism ensues<br/>
We go hard, only on campus when I wanna study abroad<br/>
Guess that's why they wonder if I go there<br/>
All the groupie bitches wanna put they fingers through my hair<br/>
Can't feed the thirst, chill out, whoa there<br/>
Let me get it, let me bring it back<br/>
Haters talking shit but I get richer when they doing that<br/>
Yes I am pursuing that, number one album, worldwide<br/>
And fuck whoever doubt him - Logic
