<i>[Reversed Speech:]</i><br/>
Is short<br/>
I am, ah<br/>
Currently on my<br/>
World tour<br/>
For The Incredible True Story<br/>
Uh, don't think too much into this shit man<br/>
Just have fun with it<br/>
It's that simple<br/>
It's crazy to think I'm currently on this tour<br/>
I'm working on two albums<br/>
The first of which that you will hear<br/>
Just know that<br/>
After this turn up shit, after this fun shit<br/>
Yo, man, you're in store for something special<br/>
Don't think too much man, just shut the fuck up and enjoy it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing:]</i><br/>
Ahhh bro<br/>
It's been a hell of a ride out<br/>
It's been a hell of a ride out
