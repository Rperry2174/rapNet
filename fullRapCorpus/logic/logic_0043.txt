<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Will I make it I don't know<br/>
From the bottom of my heart I swear to God I gotta blow<br/>
This for every time the world told me no<br/>
If I don't make it in this game I ain't got nowhere else to go<br/>
From the drama to the hoes<br/>
From the records to the shows<br/>
I gotta make it, and if they don't give me what I deserve<br/>
Then I'm a take it, I've been underrated, underestimated and hated<br/>
But I can't wait to look back and say that I made it<br/>
Cause nowadays everyone's a rapper and I hate it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh<br/>
Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
I had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears<br/>
While you was out partying, chilling and sipping on some beers<br/>
I was sacrificing adolescent years<br/>
Blood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is<br/>
And now I'm feeling, I'm feeling like the moment has arrived<br/>
With Bobby is no longer living and Logic has revived<br/>
From his ashes, music, money, liquor<br/>
I'm fucking passed this lyricism that's driven from a mass to you bastards<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Just another day, living in the hood<br/>
Just another day around the way<br/>
Feeling Good today, feeling lovely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
All I ever wanted was some financial security<br/>
And now I fuck with bitches just to match my insecurities<br/>
Cause pussy ain't nothing, but my heart is sure full of something<br/>
Now I'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather<br/>
High score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level<br/>
Mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner<br/>
Visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner<br/>
Noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: Logic]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 x2: Logic]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Logic]</i><br/>
You know my steelo, busting shots like free throws<br/>
The young bandito, cutting records like they was kilos (ha)<br/>
Is it a blessing that I'm messing with girls that wanna undress in the back of my car<br/>
Or is it just cause I'm a star?<br/>
Or is it just cause I'm a star?<br/>
5 foot 7, looked like she fell from heaven<br/>
With an ass hotter than the devil<br/>
Please call a reverend<br/>
She was black and asian<br/>
Part Hispanic and part amazing<br/>
Women they feen' us<br/>
Merely because we are the keenest<br/>
My heart only has one love like Serena and Venus<br/>
You know I under mean this genius with the bigger {ay, ay, ay}<br/>
See baby girl I know you got some problems<br/>
Just know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em<br/>
I swear I take care of all them but you gotta trust it<br/>
Love it, open your heart before you lust it<br/>
Now bust it, what<br/>
<br/>
