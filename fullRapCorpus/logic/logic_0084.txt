<i>[Hook: Adele]</i><br/>
This is the end<br/>
Hold your breathe and count to ten<br/>
Feel the earth move and then<br/>
Hear my heart burst again<br/>
For this is the end<br/>
I've drowned and dreamt this moment<br/>
So overdue, I owe them<br/>
Swept away, I'm stolen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah, It's been a long time coming, and you know it's all I got<br/>
I've been sacrificing for years while the rest of y'all have not<br/>
These motherfuckers want my spot, because we slippin' out they knot<br/>
So I'm a do this shit until the day my body rot<br/>
I said, I'm a give it my all<br/>
Never slippin', I won't fall<br/>
Down to fight right to the death, you know I've been ready to brawl<br/>
Swear to God, I've seen it all<br/>
Hold up, let me paint that picture<br/>
I was poor, you was richer<br/>
But I'm in the ring witchu<br/>
Hold up, wait, now let me hit you with some real shit<br/>
Open up your mind, maybe you'll find that you can feel this<br/>
I had nothing, came up with somethin' and I still got it<br/>
Motivated by the shit I've seen, boy, it's so hypnotic<br/>
Yeah, look to my left and see my brothers selling drugs<br/>
Uh, look to my right and see my sisters fucking thugs<br/>
It ain't funny how this life go<br/>
One moment you're in the dark, but when that light glow<br/>
It's like you're seeing for the first time<br/>
As I penetrate your mind<br/>
Like a burst of ammunition that was shot out of a nine<br/>
I'm givin' everything I got, so, yeah, it better be my time<br/>
They said I'd never make it, that's the reason I still rhyme now<br/>
<br/>
