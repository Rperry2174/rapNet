<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Let me kick rhymes<br/>
Let me do it slow<br/>
Gotta get it every time you ain't fuckin' know<br/>
See I'm half white<br/>
And half negro<br/>
So I guess that's why I got a big ego<br/>
I got double the talent so I guess I'm too nice<br/>
Tryna eat like two dykes cause I'm famished<br/>
Better yet I'm in the depths of Hungary like Budapest<br/>
And even when I'm fed I'm a keep going 'til the death<br/>
Call me the caller bomber <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cause I'm blowing minds like Osama<br/>
That's word to Obama<br/>
So much action within my words there ain't no time for drama<br/>
Bringing wisdom like Dalai Lama you ain't heard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]</i><br/>
My name is Castro<br/>
Hotter than taking shots of Tabasco<br/>
I'm the shit<br/>
Never constipated I got mad flow<br/>
Have you wondering why the fuck did he go do that for?<br/>
I don't know<br/>
Even my homies say I'm an asshole<br/>
My style is so defined<br/>
Cause I'm the definition<br/>
Of truth you want proof<br/>
Well then you better listen<br/>
I'm never dissin'<br/>
That's a waste of time<br/>
Why waste an amazing rhyme<br/>
On them when I can take it and make it mine<br/>
I'll make it fine<br/>
Homie I don't need no one's help<br/>
I stay on dimes so you can call me Roosevelt<br/>
Yeah, my flow is presidential<br/>
I rip it acapella I don't need the instrumental<br/>
So try to sleep on me<br/>
I leave you like Tom in Seattle<br/>
My wordplay is too vicious homie<br/>
So you don't wanna scrabble<br/>
You don't wanna battle<br/>
My shit will leave you without a paddle<br/>
Now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
My wifey livin' like Oprah<br/>
Matter of fact Princess Diana<br/>
Cause my first name is S-I-R<br/>
And I don't live like no bama<br/>
See I execute my emotion through perpetual grammar<br/>
Cause my stamina colder than Canada<br/>
And hotter than Hades<br/>
I spit more than babies infected with rabies<br/>
They can't get over the fact that I'm under their skin like scabies, what it do
