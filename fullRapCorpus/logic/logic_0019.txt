<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
My mentor once told me, that fire cannot be denied<br/>
I'm 20 years old, and I've sacrificed the last four years of my life, to create music just for you<br/>
My social life. Stayin' in the studio, practicing, grinding. Just to give you, the soundtracks for your life<br/>
So I'm gonna continue to wake up every day and make good music, and get that recognition<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it<br/>
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore<br/>
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Yeah, now let me switch it up with some shit you ain't ever heard<br/>
Ain't drunk but the flow's slow<br/>
Everybody just relax and listen to my words <i>[x2]</i><br/>
So many times have I designed a similar rhyme that came to mind, (inevitable)<i>[?]</i> to find the way I'm feelin' now<br/>
I'm feeling like I'm ready to blow, been waiting patiently but fuck it now I gotta go<br/>
When it comes to making this music it's nada yo, see you can't comprehend the amount of mind or heart I'm givin'<br/>
Hip-hops my show first, so you know I'm driven. Sunrise to sunset you know how I'm living<br/>
You see, I think it then write it, read it, repeat it then lace it, produce it then record it mix it then master it so the people adore it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore<br/>
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
