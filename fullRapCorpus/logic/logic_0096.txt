<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's the type of shit they read about<br/>
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out<br/>
I've been in the zone, I can't be without<br/>
This real shit that I be about<br/>
I'm a visionary, that's long term<br/>
But Def Jam, said they need it out<br/>
If I rush this shit, I might be without<br/>
But I need a vision, can't see without<br/>
I've been patient, never complacent<br/>
Left the underground when I left the basement<br/>
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation<br/>
On the road with Kid Cudi and Big<br/>
Conversations with No I.D<br/>
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay<br/>
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me<br/>
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be<br/>
Can't express what that meant for me, what it mean to me<br/>
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be<br/>
It's so different now, everything is so different now<br/>
I've been there and I've done that<br/>
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact<br/>
And I'm back again cause I love this shit<br/>
Write it down and they publish it<br/>
I went 5 years without a publicist, cause the word of mouth, they in love with this<br/>
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming<br/>
Went away a while but I've been fiending<br/>
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal<br/>
Been that way before the deal<br/>
Now the music got mass appeal<br/>
My main girl got ass appeal<br/>
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing<br/>
Little fish, that went mainstream<br/>
Now I'm big as fuck<br/>
My whole city, they know what's up<br/>
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit<br/>
I don't give a fuck<br/>
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt<br/>
When I'm talking business, I might erupt<br/>
If you're at the show, put your lighter up<br/>
Fuck with me if you're really bout it<br/>
Outsiders, I could do without it<br/>
I crept in, got slept on<br/>
Sold out shows, no one knew about it<br/>
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it<br/>
Your cosign, I could do without it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Laaa daaaa<br/>
Laaa daaaa la da da da daa da da da da da daaa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Okay, last verse I gotta make it count<br/>
Won't speak on my bank account<br/>
So many commas I'd have to pause and I can't afford to just waste the bars<br/>
Every day boy I thank the Lord, I got a lot of problems but could have more<br/>
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less<br/>
I been hungry like Budapest<br/>
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck I just know I'm blessed<br/>
Love life even though I'm stressed<br/>
This business boy, I swear a test<br/>
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check, I'll send Chris to go cut their neck<br/>
I love the building, no disrespect<br/>
But yall better ride when I'm in effect<br/>
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet<br/>
If yall fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist, Imma intercept<br/>
It's my time, put half a mill of my own money in this album<br/>
That's my dime<br/>
No rap features, just my rhymes<br/>
My story, it's all mine<br/>
From the basement to the stadium<br/>
From the Roxy to Palladium<br/>
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that<br/>
With this pretty girl on my floor, half naked playing Connect Four<br/>
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more<br/>
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind and then unwind with some slow head<br/>
All my homies like go ahead<br/>
Anyway, it's been a long time<br/>
And this here has been a long rhyme<br/>
So I gotta go, it's Logic<br/>
The one nobody would vouch for, how's that shit for an outro<br/>
<br/>
Nah nah nah nah nah nah<br/>
Nah nah nah nah nah nah<br/>
This is my story, Til The End<br/>
Nah nah nah nah nah nah<br/>
Nah nah nah nah nah nah<br/>
This is my story, Til The End<br/>
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah , Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sample:]</i><br/>
Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them<br/>
They may be misinformed about the truth<br/>
They may be misguided<br/>
Somebody has led them on the wrong path<br/>
A path of corruption and destruction, but yet God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved<br/>
<br/>
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah , Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Thalia:]</i><br/>
This concludes the Under Pressure program
