<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
On the low<br/>
What's up with you ho<br/>
Bitches smokin' dro<br/>
Bet you know<br/>
Bust like forty four<br/>
When I spit that flow 'cause we go hard<br/>
Like that shit they hustle on the boulevard<br/>
Fuck your broad<br/>
Bitch I bet I could<br/>
Bitch I bet I would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Lemme get it<br/>
Lemme get it<br/>
Lemme get it right now<br/>
That's the shit I've been on<br/>
R A double T P A C K<br/>
You know we shit on<br/>
Anybody in the way all day<br/>
I'm livin' my life boy you know to the fullest<br/>
These women, they love us, they push us and pull us<br/>
Just me and my team takin' shots without bullets<br/>
Gettin' this money, you know we don't bullshit<br/>
People they love it, they know the name<br/>
I got a little change, but I'm still the same<br/>
So break it down<br/>
Break it down<br/>
The shit I'm rockin, they don't make it now<br/>
I've got haters and they talk shit<br/>
But that's okay, I've got real shit<br/>
That's heartfelt, make you feel shit<br/>
But right now it's time for that trill shit<br/>
Killers and murderers<br/>
Dealers and burglars<br/>
Round my way, they never heard of you<br/>
From that West Deer Park<br/>
Where they kill after dark but that never occur to you<br/>
Been broke, dirt broke<br/>
While my brothers was hustlin' pushin' that coke<br/>
That's the life of a G, but it wasn't for me<br/>
And for real, that's the reason I wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kid Ink]</i><br/>
On the low<br/>
I be so high<br/>
Touchin' the sky<br/>
I got a wood, so fuck the world<br/>
Until I die<br/>
If you ain't know<br/>
It's Kid Ink baby<br/>
Representin' Alumni<br/>
Off three shots but, you ain't hear the gun cock<br/>
Fat ass blunt nigga, yours looks sun dried<br/>
What it do, I'm on two<br/>
Tell 'em straight up, no juice<br/>
Never goin' back to the broke old days<br/>
But I've got a room full of retro J's<br/>
Never seen these, look back at it<br/>
I see your bank and I laugh at it<br/>
Blowin' kush up, like an air mattress<br/>
One hit will leave a nigga asthmatic<br/>
And we goin' up<br/>
Ain't nobody sober<br/>
Know that molly, uncut<br/>
Eighteen and over<br/>
Got<br/>
Three chains<br/>
Two girls<br/>
Hangin' over my shoulders<br/>
Give it up in one motion<br/>
Know that money is the motive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Trinidad James]</i><br/>
My time<br/>
My time is now<br/>
I cannot wait<br/>
They say that love, it comes with hate<br/>
When I made it out the streets<br/>
And then that love it turned to hate<br/>
I didn't turn up, I turned away<br/>
The time is short, no time to waste<br/>
All these niggas up in my face, they ain't my friends<br/>
All these niggas up in my face, they ain't my friends<br/>
I've got fam servin' fiends<br/>
And fiends I call my fam<br/>
If you wanna keep your bitch<br/>
Then make sure she don't cross my path<br/>
'Cause if she do, she see my shoes<br/>
She peep my swag, she get online<br/>
Check my background<br/>
Bitch you seen that cash<br/>
My only motto about that money is get more<br/>
My only motto about that money is get more<br/>
<br/>
