(Hey) The mental state of a lyricist in his prime<br/>
Spittin' rhyme, thought from the mind<br/>
Poetic rhetoric that rhyme<br/>
We punch lines that leave you conflicted, and hit rewind<br/>
Every time I spit an I'll line the worlds mine<br/>
<br/>
Fuck a Matana<br/>
Quit it the second I'm out the vagina<br/>
Won't even call her ma√±ana<br/>
Sike<br/>
<br/>
Lyrical Unibomber<br/>
I'm a I'm a allergic to drama<br/>
Mentality of a felon<br/>
Rebellin' elevate<br/>
While you repellin'<br/>
Only hate because I'm sellin'<br/>
Who you tellin'?<br/>
<br/>
See I was on that raw shit<br/>
While you was on that naw shit<br/>
The people "they gonna toss it"<br/>
When that all they endorse it<br/>
<br/>
I just waited for my time to shine, I never forced it<br/>
Strategically planned it like Peyton Mannin' way before shit was even real<br/>
<br/>
I remember nights as a child with my momma, hungry<br/>
But my hunger for this music is on another level<br/>
This shit will truly have you contemplatin' deals with the devil<br/>
But homie I'm a king not a pawn I never settle<br/>
Cause this joint within my mind<br/>
Is so fine I can bend metal<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, In high school I wasn't worried about them A's and B's<br/>
I was trying to make the flow unkillable to obtain these Gs<br/>
Murder syllables, yes I aim to please, so much ice they call me Mr. Freeze<br/>
Sike<br/>
All up under your girls skirt as if I was the breeze<br/>
Flow celsius I surpass degrees<br/>
Homie, please<br/>
And now I'm feelin' like I'm number 1<br/>
Cause nobody made it in the game out of where I'm coming from<br/>
Can you feel me?<br/>
<br/>
Me and my team devised a scheme to get the cream<br/>
Followin' dreams, livin' our lives like movie scenes<br/>
It started as a team, sippin' liquor, smoking' green<br/>
For music I was a fiend, my homies know what I mean<br/>
<br/>
Ha, Lethal projectiles aimed at reptiles<br/>
Best get your money in order fore' you get checked now<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah) The beats my bitch, the mic's my mistress<br/>
Fiance flowin' I engage, don't miss this now<br/>
Hop on the track, you know I kill it to death<br/>
Fuckin' with Logic, it's inevitable that I will result in your imminent death<br/>
Now hit rewind and take a breath, Homie ain't nothin' left<br/>
I'm Gregory House and this game is testin' my patients<br/>
Been on the low like freemasons<br/>
Livin' amazing, if your shit is hot my shit is cajun<br/>
Divine white wine flowin', yes you know it's aging<br/>
You got sixteens? Ha, I got mathematical equations
