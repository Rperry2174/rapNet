<i>[Stewie Griffin:]</i> So, uhhh, it's been 24 hours. Got my money?<br/>
<i>[Brian:]</i> Ohhh, uh, you know what, just give me til next Friday. I'll have it for ya<br/>
<i>[Stewie Griffin:]</i> Oh, oh uh, that's funny. I could've sworn, I said have it today?<br/>
<i>[Brian:]</i> Yeah, I don't have it, sorry<br/>
<i>[Stewie Griffin:]</i> OH. Well alright then...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
I'm Stewie Griffin<br/>
And this game is Brian<br/>
Beatin' the hell out of em'<br/>
Tryin', to get this money<br/>
Check the statistics<br/>
The chances of me blowin' up are far from realistic<br/>
Fuck it, I'll risk it<br/>
To have a chance at fame, I'd never miss it<br/>
I know I'm gonna be famous cause my friends and family insisted<br/>
<i>[Laughs]</i><br/>
Been on the low, concernin' my shit just like a biscuit<br/>
But it's time to let off, set off, bread this bread off<br/>
Bitches I'm comin' and I ain't finna pull out<br/>
All I do is get this money<br/>
Cut these records and cool out<br/>
My favorite night of the week to perform is Friday<br/>
But I kinda see it as Louis Vuitton day<br/>
Cause when I step up on the stage<br/>
I'm snatchin' mics like Kanye<br/>
Too swift to book me for the night<br/>
That's Andre<br/>
Three stacks, I do it big<br/>
Take no relax, I'm spittin' the facts<br/>
Catch me in the booth, droppin' tracks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yeah they talkin' bout me<br/>
Yeah, I know they talkin' bout me<br/>
Yeah I know they talkin' bout me but<br/>
Never face to face, they evade it<br/>
By rappers I'm hated<br/>
Because I'm fly, while they just levitated<br/>
As the hating escalated<br/>
My flowing just elevated<br/>
Bitches I made it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Young jedi, all I do is stack bread<br/>
Said I, Be in the crib bumpin' Red Hot<br/>
Chili Peppers<br/>
This right here for all my city reppers<br/>
Fly talker, sky walker, get gritty reppers<br/>
Follow your dreams, this life ain't what it seems<br/>
They used to tell me I'd never make it<br/>
Now my flow streams<br/>
Across the world, spit lyrics, let them unfurl<br/>
Poetic rhetoric my girl<br/>
Got my mind playin' tricks on me<br/>
My eyes is closed, the ice is froze, I got it<br/>
Hip hop was never dead, but it was fallin'<br/>
And I caught it<br/>
The way I process chips, you think my brain's robotic<br/>
Fuckin' with bitches over seas cause the pussy's exotic<br/>
I went from switchin' lanes in the rain<br/>
To switchin' planes with dames<br/>
Poppin' champagne, spittin' game, and gettin' brain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stewie Griffin:]</i> Don't bring that trash in here. This is my house!
