So... here we go, here we go...<br/>
Am I ready? Are you ready? Are they ready? Are we ready?<br/>
I don't know, I don't know<br/>
What do I know?<br/>
I know<br/>
You need to<br/>
Open your mind<br/>
<br/>
I'm like hallelujah!<br/>
Praise God, almighty, the most high, alpha and omega in the sky<br/>
I'm like hallelujah!<br/>
Praise God, almighty, the most high, alpha and omega in the sky<br/>
<br/>
Made in the image of God<br/>
With a blunt in my mouth and a bitch on the side<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute my life need a massage<br/>
Happy ending with a money menage<br/>
Me, dirt broke, that's a money mirage<br/>
Runnin my city like I'm the Wizard of Oz<br/>
Everybody wanna know what I devise<br/>
Everybody wanna know, yeah<br/>
Got a new vision, everybody listen<br/>
Fuck around I got a new religion<br/>
What it is what it isn't, all of that revision<br/>
Get the fuck up out that prison<br/>
It's obvious the body is the cracker<br/>
The worse it is, what hurts it is, the blacker<br/>
Everybody actin like the brain don't matter<br/>
Mind over matter unless we talkin brain matter<br/>
Actin like you never seen a ass way fatter<br/>
Bitch way badder, mind in the gutter<br/>
Food for thought, yeah that's the plan with the butter<br/>
Talkin shit, ya get hit like what up?<br/>
I just wanna do it but I can't<br/>
World wanna tell me what I ain't<br/>
Far from a saint, come now just let that boy paint<br/>
Let a mothafucka like this live<br/>
Yeah, lemme show em what I gotta give<br/>
Let a mothafucka like this live<br/>
Made in the image of God, can you feel the vibe?<br/>
Mothafucka is you ready to ride? Is you ready to die?<br/>
Like B.I.G. the V.I.P<br/>
The greatest of all time, I'll be Ali<br/>
See, I be<br/>
The cost of livin it ain't free<br/>
See, the tab on me<br/>
Feelin' like the man got tabs on me<br/>
Wonder if I only had rags on me<br/>
Would ya love me, want me?<br/>
Here with this, I know<br/>
Funny thing is I don't even know<br/>
All I get to have and all I have to give is what my God will give<br/>
Yeah, lemme show em what I gotta give<br/>
Let a mothafucka like this live<br/>
Like, like<br/>
<br/>
I'm like hallelujah!<br/>
Praise God, almighty, the most high, alpha and omega in the sky<br/>
I'm like hallelujah!<br/>
Praise God, almighty, the most high, alpha and omega in the sky<br/>
<br/>
I'm like<br/>
Hold up wait a minute, know my mind been goin like whoaa ay<br/>
I been thinkin, prayin, hopin, dreamin it won't go away<br/>
I know my mind alright, I know ayy<br/>
I know my mind alright, do you know a way?<br/>
Your way<br/>
Do it your way<br/>
Do it your way<br/>
Do it your way<br/>
<br/>
This is beyond the flesh<br/>
This is beyond the flesh<br/>
This is from the soul<br/>
And for the soul<br/>
This is for all my brothers and sisters<br/>
For all my children<br/>
This is for every race<br/>
This is for every color, every creed<br/>
Music does not discriminate<br/>
Music is made to assimilate<br/>
Black is beautiful, black is beautiful<br/>
And so are you<br/>
Strollin down the highway, I'm strollin<br/>
And I was strollin down the highway<br/>
Strollin, strollin<br/>
With my mind ablaze<br/>
Strollin down the highway<br/>
For days and days<br/>
Strollin down the highway<br/>
With my mind ablaze<br/>
For days and days<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
I know, I know, I'm supposed to been home, I'm coming Just, I'm on my way home, every time<br/>
I'm on my way there right now, ok?<br/>
Oh shit!<br/>
Life, what's it all about?<br/>
What? Wait, where am I?<br/>
The space between spaces<br/>
Beyond time and existential intelligence<br/>
Forget, fuck all the hippy shit, where am I?<br/>
What's the last thing you remember Atom?<br/>
I was in the store, I bought some smokes, I came outside, the phone rang, I...<br/>
How do you know my name?!<br/>
You were walking home from work when you died<br/>
Died? Dead? I'm dead? I'm dead?!<br/>
It wasn't an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time<br/>
What do you mean it's my time? What? I got...<br/>
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?<br/>
Your wife? And son? You see, that's what I like to hear<br/>
You find out you're dead and the first thing you worry about is others<br/>
Man, answer me, what about my family? What's going on with Vanessa?<br/>
They're doing just fine. You see, your wife was cheating on you<br/>
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!<br/>
And even though she loved you dearly<br/>
She was a bit relieved you would never find out<br/>
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?<br/>
How you gon tell me I'm dead then gon tell me my wife cheated on me?!<br/>
Atom. None of that matters now<br/>
Walk with me<br/>
Wait, what is this? Is this... Is this heaven?<br/>
No<br/>
Well, I don't see no pitchforks, little red people runnin around, it ain't too hot up in here so I guess this ain't hell either<br/>
I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void, is to look upon it as a waiting room So... are you God?<br/>
Yes, I'm God
