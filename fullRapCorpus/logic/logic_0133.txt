Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first black man<br/>
Long ago before the white man could paint the black man with a gun in his hand<br/>
Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first white man<br/>
At the very moment when they looked around and said fuck it I'ma steal this land<br/>
Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first black man<br/>
Long ago before the white man could paint the black man with a gun in his hand<br/>
Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first white man<br/>
At the very moment when they looked around and said fuck it I'ma steal this land<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wanna tell me what I am, what I am not<br/>
You ain't black, you a mothafuckin white boy<br/>
Shut ya mouth, do it right boy, aight boy?<br/>
Man why you such a hype boy?<br/>
Why you always talk about being black?<br/>
Skin too white, nigga fuck that<br/>
Everything you talk about, cut that<br/>
That door you trying to open you could shut that<br/>
Grip the gat yeah that's how I'ma buck back<br/>
Tell me what I am and what I know now<br/>
All this prejudice has got to go<br/>
Life is moving fast it need to slow down<br/>
Come and see me when I am in yo town<br/>
Practice what we preach before it go down<br/>
Practice what we preach before it go<br/>
Yes I got the gift to gab fo sho<br/>
Will I have to get the gat? No no<br/>
Yes I got to get the gat fo sho<br/>
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the gat?<br/>
Masta deep down inside of me<br/>
The plantation deep down inside of me<br/>
Everybody fuck like sodomy<br/>
Because one or the other what it gotta be<br/>
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me<br/>
Unity for everyone that lied to me<br/>
Peace on earth what I try to be<br/>
I just wanna spread the message of equality<br/>
Yes I got to get the gat fo sho<br/>
Will I have to get the gat? No no<br/>
Yes I got to get the gat fo sho<br/>
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the gat?<br/>
<br/>
Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first black man<br/>
Long ago before the white man could paint the black man with a gun in his hand<br/>
Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first white man<br/>
At the very moment when they looked around and said fuck it I'ma steal this land<br/>
Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first black man<br/>
Long ago before the white man could paint the black man with a gun in his hand<br/>
Take it back, take it way back<br/>
Take it way way back to the first white man<br/>
At the very moment when they looked around and said fuck it I'ma steal this land<br/>
<br/>
Take it back, take it way back, take it way way back to about 1990<br/>
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland<br/>
7: 36am. Where a biracial baby was born<br/>
To a black father and a white mother<br/>
Father that wasn't there, addicted to crack cocaine, Alcohol, and various other drugs<br/>
Same as his mom<br/>
Way, way back<br/>
So I'm gonna tell you about that, I'm gonna tell you about how<br/>
All this young boy ever wanted was Happiness<br/>
All he ever wanted was positivity<br/>
All he ever wanted to do was entertain<br/>
And this boy went through hell<br/>
You gotta understand, his mother was racist<br/>
Which is crazy<br/>
Because how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men But you racist<br/>
Like bitch, that don't make no sense<br/>
But it is what it is<br/>
You know, he grew up, her callin him a nigga<br/>
The kids at school callin him a cracker<br/>
Identifying as black, looking as white<br/>
Being told what you can or can't be<br/>
This kid went through everything<br/>
He went through...<br/>
He saw narcotics in the household<br/>
He saw violence, murderers, drug dealers<br/>
He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit that happened to this kid<br/>
And he persevered while the whole world said<br/>
What they said?<br/>
Said you wouldn't be shit!<br/>
You ain't gon be nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin<br/>
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I'ma persevere<br/>
And that's why the message is always peace, love and positivity<br/>
And see, he always saw things from two sides<br/>
He always saw things from two sides<br/>
He always knew that the message<br/>
Everybody, was born equal<br/>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation<br/>
He knew that because he saw that<br/>
Because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters<br/>
That were uneducated and that did not know<br/>
And he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know<br/>
These people that are ignorant, that cannot see the bigger picture<br/>
That must fight, and kill, and murder each other<br/>
But once again, all he ever wanted to do<br/>
Was spread a message<br/>
Of equality, for every man, woman, and child<br/>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation<br/>
Now imagine this child growing up<br/>
And seeing the craziest shit<br/>
Being a part of the craziest shit<br/>
Running around with the wrong people<br/>
Running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and<br/>
All this, because he didn't know, he didn't know!<br/>
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn't right<br/>
And he knew that he needed to get away from it<br/>
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old<br/>
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself<br/>
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings<br/>
And then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep<br/>
But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of that working on music, persevering<br/>
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror<br/>
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people<br/>
Just chanting his name<br/>
Hoping that it would happen<br/>
But the, but the, but the world said No!<br/>
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no<br/>
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka<br/>
No no!<br/>
And he said fuck that<br/>
He said peace, love, and positivity<br/>
He said equality for all man<br/>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Now I also want you to imagine people telling him that he did not live this life<br/>
"You just a white boy." "You ain't never experienced that shit."<br/>
"You from Gaithersburg, Maryland. Nothing happens there."<br/>
"Oh no, no, we no, we weren't there, we didn't live with you, in your Section 8 household. We didn't live with the narcotics and violence in your household. We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside." "And since you white, you gotta have money, right?"<br/>
And this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was, wasn't, and would<br/>
Never be<br/>
And that man is here today, proud<br/>
A lover of all human beings<br/>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
And he's here to say:<br/>
Even though we're all born and created equal<br/>
We are not treated equally<br/>
There's extremists on every side<br/>
And you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe<br/>
As long as they're not hurtin anybody<br/>
You can believe they're going to hell<br/>
You can believe it's not right<br/>
You can believe you're superior, fine<br/>
Just stop killing each other
