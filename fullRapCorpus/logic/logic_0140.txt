<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Jesus, Black Jesus<br/>
Jesus, Black Jesus<br/>
<br/>
I been feeling so down<br/>
I think they should know now<br/>
I think they should know what's up<br/>
That's that road I been down<br/>
I know how it go down<br/>
I know how it go now, what's up<br/>
I feel like I don't belong<br/>
I feel like my life is wrong<br/>
I feel like I don't know what's up<br/>
What's up, what's up<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Ayy<br/>
<br/>
I ain't here to pick and choose<br/>
I ain't here to sing the blues<br/>
I'm just here to spread the clues<br/>
I'm just here to spread the news<br/>
Everybody know I do<br/>
Listen<br/>
I ain't ashamed to be white<br/>
I ain't ashamed to be Black<br/>
I ain't ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact<br/>
I know you fucking with that<br/>
And I'm not scared of the people who tell me I should be<br/>
Do what you love and don't ever wonder what it could be<br/>
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I'm good<br/>
Sometimes I'm misunderstood<br/>
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off<br/>
They feel like I'm fading<br/>
I'm right out my mind<br/>
Tell 'em!<br/>
Momma don't love me<br/>
Daddy don't love me<br/>
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly<br/>
You could be anything you wanna be<br/>
'Cept the person you don't wanna be<br/>
Let him hate let em love<br/>
Wondering if everybody still like this up above<br/>
When that push come to shove<br/>
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like<br/>
I just wanna be free<br/>
Not a slave to the stereotype<br/>
All alone in my room in the middle of the night<br/>
I don't have the words but my stereo might<br/>
I don't wanna be black, I don't wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today<br/>
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye<br/>
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin<br/>
Or the fact I'm attracted to her, maybe him<br/>
Or the fact I'm a single mother living all alone<br/>
Looking for a man and a home to call my own<br/>
But I already have one<br/>
The only man I'ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son<br/>
Son, say:<br/>
Black is beautiful<br/>
Be black and proud<br/>
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I'm black and proud<br/>
I'm just as white as that Mona Lisa<br/>
I'm just as black as my cousin Keisha<br/>
I'm biracial so bye Felicia<br/>
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher<br/>
Maybe Jesus was black<br/>
Maybe Jesus had dreads<br/>
Spiderman should be black<br/>
I vote for Glover instead<br/>
Glover instead<br/>
Like what's up<br/>
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more<br/>
I vote for so much more<br/>
<br/>
I been feeling so down<br/>
I think they should know now<br/>
I think they should know what's up<br/>
That's that road I been down<br/>
I know how it go down<br/>
I know how it go now, what's up<br/>
I feel like I don't belong<br/>
I feel like my life is wrong<br/>
I feel like I don't know what's up<br/>
What's up, what's up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic &amp; Damian:]</i><br/>
Go on and let your soul glow<br/>
Let your soul glow<br/>
Glow<br/>

Black Spiderman can he save a brother now<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Let your soul glow<br/>
Let your soul glow<br/>
Glow<br/>
