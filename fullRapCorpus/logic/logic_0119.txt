<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br/>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br/>
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br/>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br/>
I'm like...<br/>
<br/>
This the type of shit they said they really wanted<br/>
So I gave them this right here, now go get blunted<br/>
Check my last album, all y'all know I run it<br/>
Flipped the script just 'cause I could and fucking stunted<br/>
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit my life is all about<br/>
Check the Forbes list, you know I'm ballin' out<br/>
They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"<br/>
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now<br/>
Like oh, I think I know, I think I know<br/>
This flow, this super flow, out of control<br/>
Like woah, this shit like woah, I think I know<br/>
Like woah, like, like woah, like, like, like...<br/>
<br/>
This that flexicution<br/>
This is what the people say they wanted<br/>
From the young boy, from the- from the- from the God<br/>
This that flexicution<br/>
This is what the people say they wanted<br/>
From the rap God, from the- from the- from the God<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br/>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br/>
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br/>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br/>
I'm like...<br/>
<br/>
Hold on, let me bring it back<br/>
Everybody know I'm bringing the facts<br/>
And they wonder why I got it like that<br/>
'Cause I put everything right on the track<br/>
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go<br/>
I been living like woah, I been living, you already know<br/>
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake<br/>
And I'm showing where I'm going<br/>
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching<br/>
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?<br/>
Like God damn, I'm like (oh God)<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook<br/>
It's another day, another book<br/>
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana<br/>
Coming with the stamina<br/>
Bitch, put down your camera<br/>
And live in the moment<br/>
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it<br/>
So what up with it?<br/>
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing<br/>
Y'all can just shut up with it 'cause I know<br/>
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...<br/>
<br/>
This that flexicution<br/>
This is what the people say they wanted<br/>
From the young boy, from the- from the- from the God<br/>
This that flexicution<br/>
This is what the people say they wanted<br/>
From the rap God, from the- from the- from the God<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br/>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad<br/>
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<br/>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<br/>
Everything I do, you know I do it...<br/>

<i>[Jess Andrea (John Lindahl):]</i><br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
It's been a hell of a ride up (It's been a hell of a ride up)<br/>
Hell of a ride up (It's been a hell of a ride up)<br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up<br/>
