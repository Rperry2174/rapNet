<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond<br/>
I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie<br/>
Shout out to Mac... Miller<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money<br/>
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys<br/>
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<br/>
I'm one of a kind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind<br/>
And at this moment in time, I'm on a roll when I write this rhyme<br/>
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he's passed out<br/>
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out<br/>
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out<br/>
Oh my, good God you know we fly<br/>
They dreaming out the window watch how buildings pass me by<br/>
See I ain't signed but at this point in time<br/>
I feel like the 3-6-8th<br/>
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl<br/>
All I do is rhyme and get money, that's my repertoire<br/>
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"<br/>
Baby what's the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?<br/>
(Cudi what up?) It's going down, feeling like a millionaire<br/>
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That's my shit!"<br/>
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit<br/>
Or while you cruising round town riding in a whip<br/>
One thing's for sure, you better get all of your friends it<br/>
If a shorty like my music, then she a (bobbysoxer)<br/>
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie yes I rocks her<br/>
The second I jump on a stage, I'm rocking it, ain't nobody stopping it<br/>
Whoever goes on after me, I'm sorry, you ain't topping it<br/>
It's going down, feeling like a millionaire<br/>
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Ever since I was a youngin I knew I'd break in the game<br/>
While you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained<br/>
I was strategizing, before people the knew my name<br/>
Fame, but I sell it sane on the road to success<br/>
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane<br/>
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain<br/>
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito<br/>
I know we fight, but that's poquito<br/>
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we're finito<br/>
<br/>
