I wrote a bunch of letters but, I thought it made me look like a fool so I never mailed any of them out<br/>
I just wanna talk to you girl, mama you know a... I just got something I wanna say...<br/>
<br/>
Baby do you remember<br/>
Warm summers and cold winters<br/>
Songs by soul singers the feeling it still lingers<br/>
Elevated by my kiss as you melted between my fingers<br/>
Baby girl, sometimes I wish that I could just rewind this shit and take it back<br/>
I had visions but they just faded black<br/>
My train of thought is on a different track<br/>
When you're in love it's hard to separate fiction from fact<br/>
Your image in my head, and I'm tryna get rid of that<br/>
But you're always on my mind like a fitted hat<br/>
Baby girl, I wanna bring it back to puppy love<br/>
When you was sent from up above to care for me<br/>
Said that you'd always be there for me<br/>
And even though you're gone, it's like you never left<br/>
Cause you always in my heart and still take away my breath<br/>
<br/>
Can I love?<br/>
Baby girl, can I love?<br/>
I said mama can I love?<br/>
Yea, can I love?<br/>
<br/>
I wanna laugh with you<br/>
Run the water and take a bath with you<br/>
Stay up late and watch romantic comedies<br/>
When it comes down to it you're my hearts commodity<br/>
Yea, and now I'm feeling like a fool<br/>
Writing love letters that you'll probably never get<br/>
And right now, I love you more than I'd like to admit<br/>
Because we're separated<br/>
Onto you this song is dedicated<br/>
I'm love sick and I need you to medicate it<br/>
Feeling devastated<br/>
I think about the past<br/>
And now I hate it<br/>
Cause all it proves it that whenever made it<br/>
Uh, see me and shorty got history like a textbook<br/>
But lately our position is changed like that sex book<br/>
Ms. Independent she the type to hold her own<br/>
Late night contemplating all alone<br/>
The kingdom is empty without the queen upon the throne<br/>
<br/>
Can I love?<br/>
Baby girl can I love?<br/>
Mama can I love?<br/>
I'm a ask you can I love?<br/>
<br/>
They say there's many more in the sea<br/>
But rather then go fish I play solitare<br/>
I look around and see you everywhere<br/>
But at the same you're never there<br/>
Fingers through your hair<br/>
Reminiscing bout when and where<br/>
Remember when we pulled up to that spot and did it there<br/>
See I hate to watch you walk away<br/>
But I love to watch you come<br/>
Baby girl you're so lustful then innocent when it's done<br/>
The love we share is like a fine wine<br/>
Cause no matter what happens, it only gets better with time<br/>
Baby girl you're so fine that I had to take the time<br/>
To articulate this rhyme with you in mind, you're so divine<br/>
Ain't no matter who you're fucking with<br/>
Or no matter who I'm fucking with, you'll still be mine<br/>
Will we make it? I don't know<br/>
The only thing that will tell us is time<br/>
<br/>
Can I love?<br/>
Can I love?<br/>
Baby girl can I love?<br/>
Can I love?
