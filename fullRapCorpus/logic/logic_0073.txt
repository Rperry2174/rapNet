<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Who would have thought that painting pictures 'bout being broke<br/>
Would get me rich just like dealing coke<br/>
Like big brother used to do so we could stay afloat<br/>
I heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would talk<br/>
Thought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote<br/>
While they was firing, you could hear sirens<br/>
From people dialling and women crying in the phone<br/>
I was in the zone, trying to make a living<br/>
Heading to work in the morning<br/>
Nobody felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased<br/>
Until I quit my job, then my work ethic increased<br/>
Elevated to levels I ain't ever seen<br/>
Stacking this cream, living the American dream now<br/>
I'm going crazy, I ain't slept in days<br/>
Dreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J's<br/>
Always shouting out my team 'cause I get all the plays<br/>
But they the ones that motivate me on depressing days<br/>
See I'm from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation<br/>
From the smallest altercation, that can lead determination<br/>
With a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation<br/>
Passing bars back and forth like legal examinations<br/>
As a youngin I was running wild<br/>
Me and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud<br/>
Doing shit just to do it, 'cause we wasn't allowed<br/>
I thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah<br/>
Now when my momma was at home drinking, thinking 'bout the bills<br/>
I was dreaming 'bout the mills, running round looking for thrills<br/>
I guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page<br/>
And paints a picture of another age<br/>
Back in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark<br/>
'Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down<br/>
'Til we get older and hustle, now they try'na gun us down<br/>
We just trying to make a living off of what we've been given<br/>
Wassup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Walk on by<br/>
Walk on by<br/>
Walk on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
They call me Logic, yeah that's L-O-G-I-C<br/>
I ain't rucked up in them bitches, I just write 'bout shit I see<br/>
'Cause these lyrics set me free, fuck the world, let me be<br/>
And when I feel like I can't write, that's when I hit the MPC<br/>
My talent limitless, my time limited so listen up<br/>
If you can't see the shit I see, you better get your vision up<br/>
I'm the king, watch me reign, born to rule my domain<br/>
Album ain't even in stores, they trynna sue me for my name<br/>
Shit insane, so berzerk, never complained, I just work<br/>
Chasing after my dreams like them high school skirts<br/>
Back as a youngin, spitting game, try'na get the nut in<br/>
Living life to the fullest 'cause them little things ain't nothing<br/>
My flow un-killable when I be murdering syllables<br/>
But I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme<br/>
Perfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb<br/>
I be rapping 'til I'm dying, doing everything I love<br/>
That's the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor<br/>
Try'na get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed<br/>
That's the type of shit I need, lyrics bleed from my mind state<br/>
Elevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate<br/>
'Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low<br/>
And sometimes I do shit I thought I'd never do before<br/>
My life is like a movie role that's starring me<br/>
Got these women on me<br/>
I hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me<br/>
At the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot<br/>
Pretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips<br/>
Put my hands on her hips, 'til she puts them on her tits<br/>
Freak bitch, want the dick, biting on her finger tip<br/>
I only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit<br/>
I'm thinking 'bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wiling out<br/>
But that pussy wet as hell, I think it's time to end the drought<br/>
Then I guess she could be burning, and that's not what I'm about<br/>
So I dipped out, to live another day and die another night<br/>
'Cause when I'm gone that ain't go'n be the song that they recite<br/>
Waddup
