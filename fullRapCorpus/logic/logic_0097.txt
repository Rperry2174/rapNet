<i>[Verse 1 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Somewhere this shit done got crazy<br/>
I've just been driving Miss Daisy<br/>
With my hands on the steering wheel<br/>
And my eyes on the pavement<br/>
I give a fuck 'bout where they went<br/>
I owe my lawyer a payment<br/>
They talking 'bout no arraignment<br/>
Now I wonder where the rain went<br/>
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressing<br/>
I been counting what's on my bucket list and not on my blessing's<br/>
I think it's time for a lesson, hold up, you better pay attention<br/>
I can't end up like my momma popping anti-depressants<br/>
My therapist think I'm crazy, well shit, she probably does<br/>
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs<br/>
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs<br/>
Shit I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was<br/>
But I know who I am, yes, I know who I is<br/>
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy vibing with this<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
That Bino the realest, uh, this beat made me kill it, uh<br/>
Her feet to the ceiling, she said that she love me<br/>
She never said that in college, 3005 is our mileage<br/>
I'm in my lane like a Prius, because I'm moving in silence<br/>
You still ain't broke down yet?<br/>
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's<br/>
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left<br/>
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left<br/>
Relationships look closer in that rearview<br/>
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you<br/>
So now you gotta stop, park, put that shit in neutral<br/>
Yeah, you really love her, but is she worth your future?<br/>
Your Ciara, your Beyonc√©, they'll be saying he got money<br/>
Think that Kim be with Kanye if he left drive in the driveway?<br/>
Yeah, I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is<br/>
We were driving together, when we met we were kids<br/>
You ain't know 'bout the biz, I ain't know 'bout it either<br/>
I see you in that new ride, I flash my lights when I see you<br/>
I just be driving<br/>

<i>[Outro - Logic:]</i><br/>
Turn left on West Deer Park<br/>
Doing ninety on the highway, we gon' do it my way<br/>
Ninety on the highway, we gon' do it my way<br/>
Ninety on the high <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I've just been driving Miss Daisy <i>[4x]</i>
