Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed<br/>
Everywhere I look a killing spree<br/>
All the things they wanted me to be<br/>
Is all the things that I turned out to be<br/>
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed<br/>
Everywhere I look a killing spree<br/>
All the things they wanted me to be<br/>
Is everything that I like, like, like, like<br/>

Real shit goin on in Lebanon<br/>
But I don't give a fuck, my favorite show is coming on<br/>
Hashtag pray for this, pray for that<br/>
But you ain't doing shit, get away from that<br/>
Blame it on black, blame it on a white<br/>
Blame it on a gun, blame it on a Muslim<br/>
Everybody wanna blame him, blame her<br/>
Just blame it on a mothafucka killing everyone!<br/>
Everybody wanna get high, everybody wanna live life like they can't die<br/>
Everybody gotta be right<br/>
Everybody scrollin, scrollin, thru they life<br/>
I wish they would love me like I like they pictures<br/>
I wish I had bitches<br/>
I wish I had motivation to get money<br/>
Ain't it funny, my rainy day would be sunny<br/>
If I had the vision of currency fallin above from the sky<br/>
Fallin above from the sky, listen up<br/>
Everybody looking for the meaning of life thru a cell phone screen<br/>
Everybody looking for the meaning of life thru a cell phone screen<br/>
Everybody think that the meaning of life is<br/>
Everybody think that the meaning of life is<br/>

<i>[Ansel Elgort:]</i><br/>
Oh, I know it's hard, I know it's hard like<br/>
I know that's the reason you turn up at night<br/>
Livin yo life, just livin yo life<br/>
Can't nobody tell you how to do it right<br/>
Come away with me, come away with me<br/>
Let me take you from this world of insanity<br/>
Come away with me, come away with me<br/>
Far away from flying bullets on this killing spree<br/>
Oh, I, I know, I, I know<br/>
It's hard, yea, it's hard, yea<br/>
Yea I know it's hard sometimes<br/>
It's hard sometimes<br/>
