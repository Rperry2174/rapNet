I am not a poet, I am just a designer of words<br/>
Architecting sentences the way I form and merge<br/>
Paragraphs together that force MC's to submerge<br/>
With an urge, to break free of this bi-racial jail cell<br/>
Feast on my memories, please come and taste this<br/>
Papa was a black man, mama was a racist<br/>
Growing up she called me nigga, kids called me cracker<br/>
While the whites got whiter, and the blacks got blacker<br/>
I was hurting, doing everything I can<br/>
Conceived as a white boy with the soul of a black man<br/>
God damn, looking up to Malcolm X<br/>
Studying his speeches, underlining text<br/>
How can I be white devil if my parents had sex<br/>
'Cus I'm black and I'm white<br/>
And I'm proud of every word that I recite<br/>
I know my roots, I know my past<br/>
I know the issue of my race ain't gonna last<br/>
Yo, we all breathe the same air and bleed the same blood<br/>
And when we die, the same dish gets dug<br/>
<br/>
"I still have a dream, it is a dream teached within the American dream<br/>
That one day, this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of being free<br/>
Behold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equally."
