<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know that I got it yeah we got it over here<br/>
I know that I got it yeah we got it all here<br/>
Just me and my homies livin' life over here<br/>
Couple bad bitches down to ride oh yeah,<br/>
I know that I got it if I take my time,<br/>
I know that I got it everything will be fine,<br/>
Couldn't wait to get it now we got it over here,<br/>
Couldn't wait to get it now we got it oh yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Tell me what you know about the come up,<br/>
While you at the party I be working 'til the sun up, yeah<br/>
I just wanna live my life, and give you everything that I can give all right, all right<br/>
Me and my homies live in Hollywood, but that don't mean we hollywood<br/>
And if I could reply to everything, hell yeah you know I probably would<br/>
Live life 'til I overdose I said it once, had to say it dos<br/>
I remember living at Mary Jo's, now I'm living like pharaohs<br/>
I, work like a slave, live like a king<br/>
Cause in the end I promise money ain't a thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I just wanna do it right<br/>
I just wanna go tonight<br/>
Getting lost in the city lights, getting lost in the pretty lies<br/>
Yeah, shout out to Maryland, shout out Chicago<br/>
Shout out beautiful women that follow where I go,<br/>
Cause I know I got no time for these fake hoes and these fake rhymes<br/>
We live it up and it's great times,<br/>
Always on my mind this is real life,<br/>
Okay I guess this is what it feels like<br/>
Just me and my homies do you realize?<br/>
This the type of shit I used to prohisize<br/>
Eyes on the real though<br/>
All ya'll probably back down on the real low,<br/>
I switched it up the day I got a deal yo,<br/>
But I'm bringing that real flow<br/>
And of course a little bit of melody guess I got the appeal though<br/>
But don't ever think I'll be sacrificing with the skill though,<br/>
I said I'm bringing that real flow,<br/>
I 'membing coming up real po<br/>
Let me bring it down real slow<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeahhh, oh yeah.<br/>
Yeah
