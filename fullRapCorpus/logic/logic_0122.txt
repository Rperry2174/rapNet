<i>[Phone Intro - Logic (Marty Randolph) &amp; Logic (Female Voice):]</i><br/>
Let's see here, uh, (301) 776-4308<br/>
This motherfucker better pick up the God damn phone this time, Jesus Christ<br/>
Thank you for calling RattPack Industries<br/>
Yes hel...<br/>
Where we don't fuck with anybody<br/>
Someone will be with you momentarily<br/>
Jesus man, seriously? Jesus bro, fuck bro...<br/>
Current wait time is 1 minute<br/>
Fuck man, fuckers better not have me waiting all God damn day in here-Jesus...<br/>
While you wait, please listen to a word from our sponsors...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit - YaLocalWhiteBoy, Logic (Marty Randolph) &amp; Logic (Female Voice):]</i><br/>
Y'know, it's crazy cause it's two types of motherfuckers<br/>
It's one motherfucker talking 'bout:<br/>
"Oh Logic's so slept on, he's so lowkey..."<br/>
Knowing damn well this motherfucker did 135K first week<br/>
First fucking week!<br/>
Then it's other motherfuckers talking 'bout:<br/>
"Oh, Logic's blowing up, he's getting so big now. I don't want him to blow up on me. Oh, Logic's changing..."<br/>
Cause he made a turnt ass mixtape!<br/>
We're going to be bumping this shit the whole summer!<br/>
The fuck?!<br/>
Current wait time is 36 minutes...<br/>
36 minutes? It was just a minu-it was just one minute!<br/>
What the fuck?!<br/>
And do y'all not listen to lyrics?<br/>
He's making a whole other concept album<br/>
That's fucking insane!<br/>
This man dropped a project every year for six years<br/>
I mean, I'm not complaining though but-<br/>
Current wait time is 1 hour, 40 minutes...<br/>
1 hou-WHAT THE F-?! This, this-this is gotta be hands down the fucking worst customer service of all time<br/>
You can just-I can't-<br/>
This motherfucker made a number one album!<br/>
What?<br/>
Made a mixtape after...<br/>
Oh my God-<br/>
And then he's making another concept album...<br/>
This is fucking bullshit...<br/>
Like his first shit didn't already go Number 1?!<br/>
Nobody cares...<br/>
This motherfucker's on a role!<br/>
NOBODY CARES!<br/>
This motherfucker's like butter, he's on a roll motherfucker!<br/>
Current wait time is...<br/>
Okay God, thank God!<br/>
16 hours<br/>
What the...? WHAT THE FUCK?!<br/>
And it's peace, love and positivity<br/>
Logic is the only rap concert you can go to<br/>
And not get shot in the face<br/>
Like this motherfucker actually loves his fans<br/>
You name it: YouTube videos, Periscope, Vlogs, Q&amp;A's<br/>
This motherfucker does it all!<br/>
You name it, he does it! The fuck?<br/>
WHAT FUCKING RAPPER DOES THAT?!<br/>
Current wait time is...<br/>
Okay...?<br/>
Go fuck yourself<br/>
Go-go fuck? WHAT?!<br/>
And this motherfucker can solve up to seven Rubix Cubes in a minute...<br/>
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW CAN DO THAT?!<br/>
This is ridiculous!<br/>
No one is available at this time<br/>
WHAT?! I'm gonna let this motherfucker have it!<br/>
Please leave a message after the tone...<br/>
