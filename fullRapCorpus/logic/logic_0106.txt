Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time<br/>
I think about specific moments that I could rewind<br/>
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide<br/>
And truly understand the deeper things that I don't know about<br/>
Now take a trip with me and vibe<br/>
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?<br/>
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe<br/>
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive<br/>
I'm gonna take this moment right now here and school them people<br/>
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal<br/>
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people<br/>
Truly wish that I could, check it<br/>
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world<br/>
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world<br/>
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters<br/>
All different colors and creed all come together for me<br/>
Boy, I'm blessed to be free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lucy Rose:]</i><br/>
This is our time<br/>
Still I'm looking back<br/>
Let me rewind<br/>
This is our ride<br/>
Don't let me lose my faith<br/>
Let me rewind<br/>
<br/>
Doing 70 on this highway<br/>
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open<br/>
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping<br/>
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in<br/>
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit<br/>
It's been like 3 months since I've been home<br/>
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone<br/>
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on<br/>
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it<br/>
Let me bring 'em back<br/>
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever<br/>
My endeavor like a feature film<br/>
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?<br/>
I'm in it, my limit the chillest<br/>
Let me bring 'em back, yo<br/>
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing<br/>
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing<br/>
But I'm testing, reminiscing when I would listen to my intuition<br/>
And now I made it, resurrecting, Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated<br/>
It seem like everyone's somehow related<br/>
Letters back and forth from my homie that's locked up in prison<br/>
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him<br/>
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man<br/>
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in<br/>
What if the tables was turned and I was the one that been in, damn<br/>
He said he's seen me in the magazine<br/>
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel<br/>
That's been my dog from the kennel<br/>
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one<br/>
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun<br/>
Skipping class with all of my homies, on a constant search for who I was<br/>
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because<br/>
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs<br/>
I never graduated but I made it to the summit<br/>
Don't get me wrong, so many times I thought that I would plummet<br/>
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem to stomach<br/>
All of the beef around my way<br/>
I mean, I never wanted to live a life where all you're truly living is a lie<br/>
I knew I always wanted more and so they wonder why<br/>
I said they wonder why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lucy Rose:]</i><br/>
This is our time<br/>
Still I'm looking back<br/>
Let me rewind<br/>
This is our ride<br/>
Don't let me lose my faith<br/>
Let me rewind<br/>
<br/>
So what do you think about space<br/>
Um, space is called the galaxy<br/>
Do you know planets? What are- can you name some planets off?<br/>
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth, Mars and the planet Paradise<br/>
You've never been there before?<br/>
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in a coolest ship.<br/>
My TV showed us where we are in space. But there was droid ships everywhere<br/>
Well, thank you for your time, sir. I appreciate the interview
