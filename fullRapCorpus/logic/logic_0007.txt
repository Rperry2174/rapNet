Big L rest in peace...<br/>
<br/>
2 A.M., just got outta the bar, headed to my car<br/>
Me and Castro kind of blown 'cus we parked so far<br/>
Walkin' down the street, spot a couple of goonies on the creek<br/>
Pockets full of cash, so we dash fast, to avoid they ass<br/>
Cause we know they trailin' now we on the run<br/>
Heavily inhaling, exhaling as I begin to caress my gun<br/>
We gettin' closer to our destination<br/>
I always mind my business but, somehow I find myself in these situations<br/>
Death what I'm facin' if I give up now<br/>
They startin' poppin so you know we exchangin' bullets in the street<br/>
He dropped one but, I graze another<br/>
And in the heat of the moment I thought about my girl and how much I love her<br/>
Prayin' to god that tonight wasn't my last supper<br/>
Cause they tryin' to spill my blood and break me for this bread<br/>
Motherfucker take all this lead, yeah that's what I said<br/>
That's 2 down and 2 to go<br/>
But, then the others disappeared yo<br/>
So, now we on the roll, finally made it back to the car<br/>
My homie thinkin' that we all good but, hold up there they are<br/>
Buckin' fast in the XLR<br/>
Goddamn what a mission<br/>
Thought process, keys to ignition<br/>
Try to ditch 'em, so now we in the whip speedin'<br/>
Dodgin' bullets as we proceedin'<br/>
'To my man lenbo<br/>
These bammers try to play us like nintendo, hell no<br/>
Hit him on the phone, let him know we wasn't alone<br/>
Comin' through the zone, my homie picked up before the dial tone<br/>
"Whaddup my man, what's good? Is everything ok?"<br/>
Hell naw, get your heater and be ready to spray<br/>
Pulled up to his crib and my man was ready to go, ha<br/>
Jumped in the back with a semi-automatic<br/>
Bustin' eratic, quite the lethal weapon addict<br/>
So, we let 'em have it<br/>
Weaving in and out of traffic until we lost 'em<br/>
Whippin' for a couple of minutes wishin' we could've tossed<br/>
So now I'm drivin, thankin' god that I'm still survivin'<br/>
Received the call from my man boss, he was chillin' and vibin'<br/>
Said he was on the road, found out about a pack of waves<br/>
So, I said that's getup, I got a story that'll blow you away<br/>
Couple minutes passed, met up at a red light<br/>
Called him on his celly celler<br/>
"Lets hit the deli and grab a bite"<br/>
So, now it's me lenbo and Castro inside of my car<br/>
Plus, my homie boss trailin' behind us but, not too far<br/>
Now we on the strip, everybody coolin' they jets<br/>
'Til I hear my man Castro yell out "oh shit"<br/>
Here come the motherfuckers again out the blue like a crip<br/>
They must've followed us tryin' to take out the whole lot of us<br/>
Now they bustin' at boss<br/>
Movin' through the tired and I made them crash<br/>
Now they comin' for ours<br/>
I hit the uuee while, my man blast<br/>
Hit the passenger in the door, now his brains up on the dash<br/>
The driver stopped, tryin' to clean the blood up off the glass<br/>
Givin' us just enough time to go and pick up boss' ass<br/>
All together, started raining I hate this weather<br/>
But it didn't matter, only thing on my mind is vendetta<br/>
Cause that was for the one<br/>
He scared as shit but, we chasin' sun<br/>
Hit the highway, doin' it up by a buck and some<br/>
Castro halfway up the sunroof firin'<br/>
No fear, so, I guess that's what I do admire him<br/>
Duckin' Strays, 'til he caught one in the shoulder<br/>
Fell back, gushin' blood, but, my man's a soldier<br/>
He hit the exit, now we whippin' through the city<br/>
Contemplating, how the situations getting shitty<br/>
Now we out of ammo, so. we sped up to the side of his ride<br/>
And tended to collide hit him quick and watched the whip slide<br/>
My man boss strapped the gat from lenbo half out the window<br/>
Shot the gas tank, we watched the whole thing blow<br/>
Now we laughin' headed to the hospital for Castro<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, I guess popo got wind of the blow<br/>
Cause like 15 cars came out of nowhere yo<br/>
And now they on pursuit, didn't even hesitate to shoot<br/>
Murder weapon possession in the trunk for the loot<br/>
If we get caught it's either life or death so fuck 'em<br/>
Might as well go out blazin' we might just duck 'em<br/>
Hit a hard right, goin 120 through a warehouse<br/>
Hit the lights in the engine so, they don't know our where abouts<br/>
Just around the corner was a bridge out of the city<br/>
No cops in sight, me and my homies feelin' giddy<br/>
My man, Castro, was like fuck them coppers<br/>
But, speak of the devil 'cause appearred two choppers<br/>
They lights on us, callin' out cars to our location<br/>
Mind racin', checked the rearview<br/>
Saw every cop from the fuckin' station<br/>
And what was comin' and the bridge was risin'<br/>
You shoulda saw it, told my boys to buckle up cause I'm about to floor it<br/>
Everything was perfectly aligned and we was at a good speed<br/>
My homie lenbo didn't hesitate to spark the good weed<br/>
Feelin' like I'm home free halfway up the ramp<br/>
Escape is my goal, but, open fire hit the tire<br/>
Now we outta control, off of the bridge we go<br/>
<br/>
(Logic, yo Logic, yo wake up man, Logic, yo wake up man, Logic, wake up man)<br/>
Wassup?<br/>
(We're finally here, man)<br/>
Oh<br/>
(The studio, let's go)<br/>
Oh, alright, alright<br/>
I had the craziest fucking dream, dawg
