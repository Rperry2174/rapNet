<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You already know what I been on<br/>
You know where I be at<br/>
Cause men lie, women lie<br/>
Numbers don't I see that? (Don't I see that?)<br/>
<br/>
Catch me in a private jet<br/>
Like fuck it where the weed at?<br/>
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass<br/>
You know I need that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Now these bitches say they love me<br/>
But they're just obsessed with the image<br/>
Now if practice makes perfect<br/>
Then this is a scrimmage<br/>
<br/>
Cause I ain't perfect<br/>
I never said I was<br/>
But now they're hating<br/>
Cause a brotha finally got some buzz<br/>
<br/>
The things that I say (Say)<br/>
The places I'm seeing (Seeing)<br/>
The people I talk to<br/>
You don't know what I mean<br/>
<br/>
Even matters of love<br/>
It ain't always as it seems<br/>
Yeah there's plenty in the sea<br/>
Until you hit the mainstream<br/>
<br/>
The girl that I love<br/>
The one I call my honey<br/>
Now I wonder if she love me for me<br/>
Or for my fucking money<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think about the love<br/>
That I had in the past<br/>
I truly miss it<br/>
But It just wasn't destined to last<br/>
<br/>
Cause our separation<br/>
Lit a fire under my ass<br/>
And now I'm gunning for the throne<br/>
Yeah that is my task<br/>
<br/>
Just a youngin' with a dream<br/>
That acquired a team<br/>
Motivated by bad bitches<br/>
And rockin supreme<br/>
<br/>
Now the whole world<br/>
Wonders what's his next move<br/>
That all depends on<br/>
What I feel that I need to improve<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what you think of me<br/>
I swear it doesn't matter<br/>
Just as long as I am happy<br/>
And my pocket's getting fatter<br/>
<br/>
Just watch me shatter the competition<br/>
Getting madder then all of them wishing<br/>
You couldn't of done it like I done it<br/>
Bitch I run it, Ah!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah you know I do it<br/>
Like it ain't never been done<br/>
Hit the Vegas strip<br/>
And blow a million euro just for fun<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I may have embellished<br/>
That last line<br/>
Chillin' with a shorty<br/>
That is so much more than fine<br/>
<br/>
At the penthouse poppin' bottles<br/>
Of that hundred thousand dollar wine<br/>
I got the connect<br/>
Met 'em through the grape vine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: first four lines x2]</i><br/>
You know what I been on<br/>
You know where I be at<br/>
Cause men lie, women lie<br/>
Numbers don't I see that? (Don't I see that?)<br/>
<br/>
Catch me in a private jet<br/>
Like fuck it where the weed at?<br/>
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass<br/>
You know I need that<br/>
<br/>
Now these bitches say they love me<br/>
But they're just obsessed with the image<br/>
You know what I been on<br/>
You know where I be at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah, It's been a year<br/>
And everything I said would happen, has<br/>
New school style with old school bars<br/>
Like Alcatraz<br/>
<br/>
Cause I ain't never<br/>
Second guess this music shit<br/>
I knew this shit<br/>
Was all I ever wanted, all I ever had<br/>
<br/>
Born famous now it's just time to convince the world<br/>
Ditch cats, like drainage<br/>
If they disrespect it<br/>
Don't step through<br/>
<br/>
I paint pictures for your mind<br/>
And bring it to life like cinematography<br/>
Say it then I do it<br/>
My whole career is a prophecy<br/>
<br/>
Now, better grab your jacket<br/>
Cause in this world we live in it's cold out<br/>
And when my album hits the stores<br/>
It's sold out<br/>
<br/>
Like these rapper's careers<br/>
I'm the sum of our fears<br/>
Fuck a grammy nominated<br/>
Bitch, I made it and I'm here<br/>
<br/>
I said it's all about the fans, Not about the record sells<br/>
They said it wouldn't work, I told them go fuck themselves<br/>
Why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail<br/>
Why, Why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: first four lines x2]</i><br/>
You know what I been on<br/>
You know where I be at<br/>
Cause men lie, women lie<br/>
Numbers don't I see that? (Don't I see that?)<br/>
<br/>
Catch me in a private jet<br/>
Like fuck it where the weed at?<br/>
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass<br/>
You know I need that<br/>
<br/>
Now these bitches say they love me<br/>
But they're just obsessed with the image<br/>
You know what I been on<br/>
You know where I be at<br/>
<br/>
Sinatra<br/>
<br/>
"You gotta realize, a lot of the time when I talk<br/>
And I'm talking extremely cocky, I'm not talking<br/>
About myself, I'm talking about the work."<br/>
<br/>
You know here I be at<br/>
<br/>
