Smoking in London while the snow fall<br/>
In another country so pardon me for the roll call<br/>
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense<br/>
On the first fucking plane to Paris so pardon my french<br/>
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out<br/>
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese<br/>
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, "bitch please, what up?"<br/>
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse<br/>
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse<br/>
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me<br/>
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me<br/>
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental<br/>
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental<br/>
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental<br/>
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel<br/>
My ex hit me talkin bout she wanna make up<br/>
But on the real, I got no time for cover girls<br/>
Music is my main bitch, no time for other girls<br/>
I'm finna blow like Hiroshima, my demeanor get meaner<br/>
Watch me elevate to arenas<br/>
Me without the mic, that's like<br/>
Martin without the Gina, Venus without Serena<br/>
Now these thirsty bitches on the dick, we call that Aquafina<br/>
I used to bus tables until them tables turned<br/>
And everything I have obtained is everything I've earned<br/>
And everything I rap about is everything I've learned<br/>
So hopefully the listener can position a situation where they don't get burned<br/>
And they can learn from my mistakes, like I've learned from the greats<br/>
To do whatever it takes, for Heaven's sakes open your mind<br/>
This shit's one of a kind, elegant and refined, irrelevant to the swine<br/>
What's the deal?<br/>
Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville, on the real<br/>
To various people I do appeal, because of skill<br/>
So this the type of shit I'm gon keep making<br/>
That make MCs break fast like flapjacks and bacon<br/>
Rest in peace to BIG, and many other fallen soldiers<br/>
Never Hollywood, I'm grounded like a cup of Folgers, bitch I told ya<br/>
Allow me to open up your mind and mold ya<br/>
Indulge ya, within this shit I call the second Renascence<br/>
The system broke and they sent Logic in for maintenance<br/>
All you wack rappers couldn't break change to make sense<br/>
I'm back again with another argument about how much I'm black again<br/>
Fighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin<br/>
It's kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you<br/>
That's ignant<br/>
Ain't seen my mommy in a minute<br/>
Cause growing up she called me a nigga<br/>
That would never amount to nothing<br/>
Racism from my own momma, left home because of drama<br/>
But I can make it in the rap game, look at Obama<br/>
You ain't been in my shoes, you don't know my story<br/>
You don't know what's in store, but bitch I stocked the inventory<br/>
Fuck a critic with the balls to try to tell me how I feel<br/>
You wasn't with me as a child<br/>
Never once did you feel the pain of my stomach<br/>
That manifested from the lack of meals<br/>
Headed to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels<br/>
We aim to keep it real<br/>
And hell no we ain't never missing<br/>
Came a long way from eating when government gave permission<br/>
If you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen<br/>
Just an outkast with a mission to spit to whoever listen<br/>
Bitch it's Logic!
