<i>[Intro: Logic - acapella]</i><br/>
I'm on the come up<br/>
Anything that ya'll do I'm one up<br/>
Ya'll grind till like 3 in the morning<br/>
I grind till the sun up<br/>
Homie that's dedication<br/>
This world is what I'm facing<br/>
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
(I'm trying to write my wrongs, but it's funny these same wrongs helped me write this song)<br/>
Momma I'm sorry that I left at 17<br/>
(I apologize a trillion times)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Everything ain't what it seem when you try and follow your dreams<br/>
First you saw the bigger picture<br/>
Now you see behind the scenes<br/>
You though everything was sweet<br/>
Now you see that shit is mean<br/>
Got a taste now you a fiend<br/>
Been into it since you been a teen<br/>
Yeah he nice so all his friends say he gon' blow like Hiroshim<br/>
Eyes on the prize like the baddest bitch you ever seen<br/>
At home late night, chillin, envisioning<br/>
Himself on the cover of Vibe magazine<br/>
But everything ain't what it seems<br/>
Though it seem like he gon' blow<br/>
Will he make it?<br/>
Maybe so<br/>
Too be honest I don't know<br/>
He got lyrics, he got flow<br/>
But it takes so much mo'<br/>
So much love<br/>
So much pain<br/>
With such little time to grow<br/>
Yeah we love it when he smile<br/>
But hate it when he frown<br/>
Remember when that girl turned his world upside down<br/>
But it made his music better<br/>
Brought emotion made it clever<br/>
Now we growing everyday<br/>
But he hungry try to eat<br/>
Brain like an EKG the way that he study the beat<br/>
Now we know that he gon' make it and he won't accept defeat<br/>
Now I ain't tryin to be mean<br/>
Now I ain't tryin to be mean<br/>
But everything ain't what it seem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
So many times did I design a rhyme to blow your mind?<br/>
Cause I know that I wasn't destined to live a life of crime<br/>
I remember Christmas's with no presents<br/>
I use to fear my future now I dread my adolescence<br/>
Living a life of logic<br/>
But it ain't what it's cut out to be<br/>
Cause if I couldn't rap ya'll wouldn't give a fuck about me<br/>
Hip hop is politics<br/>
Filled with nothing but strife and stress<br/>
Time is money and it's hard to invest<br/>
Step on the stage I get the honeys so wet<br/>
Rockin thousand dollar tuxes sippin on nothing but Moet<br/>
Thinking I'm so set but really I ain't done shit yet<br/>
This game is war and in my mind I'm like a Vietnam vet<br/>
Now I'm on the come up<br/>
Anything that ya'll do I'll one up<br/>
Ya'll grind till 3 in the morning; I grind till the sun up<br/>
Homie that's dedication<br/>
This world is what I'm facing<br/>
I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
For the motherfuckers that hated I made it<br/>
Slowly elevated, escalated onto another level ha<br/>
My flow is crack the game is Whitney yeah<br/>
Fame is Bobby on their first date it ain't hit me yet<br/>
Visualizing driving down the horizon<br/>
While you despising the fact that I'm rising<br/>
So much hate within this world this shit is so traumatizing<br/>
Steppin to me yeah you better be alphabetically ready<br/>
Aim steady<br/>
Lyricism sharp as machete<br/>
I got it already<br/>
See I was born to sell records<br/>
You was destined to sell tunes<br/>
All up your headphones<br/>
Killing booths like cellphones<br/>
(I got it)<br/>
Cause everything ain't what is seems<br/>
It ain't just him it takes a team<br/>
At the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean<br/>
Yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety<br/>
So truly he is me and motherfucker you can't face me<br/>
Now I've had a lot of doubt<br/>
I thought I had to throw that out<br/>
Cause I find that they listen when I rhyme not when I shout<br/>
And right now shit is rocky<br/>
With me and my girl<br/>
See music is my moon but this shawty is my world<br/>
Think about you all the time<br/>
Turn that shit into a rhyme<br/>
Cause sometimes you can ignore me<br/>
But the beat listens just fine<br/>
Tell me do you even know<br/>
If you truly want to grow<br/>
Hate letters when I'm writing Love Jones all I know<br/>
Cause everything ain't what it seems<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Logic - acapella]</i><br/>
Living a life you only dream about<br/>
Flow angelic but now it's time to bring the demon out<br/>
Can you feel me?<br/>
I said it's hard being a saint inside a sinner's body<br/>
You know it's hard living as Logic after living as Bobby<br/>
This is the life I depicted<br/>
As a child I picked it<br/>
Feeling conflicted<br/>
To music I am addicted<br/>
Not one of ya'll can predict it<br/>
So many bars I'm feeling convicted<br/>
Now writing like a felony I'm selling homie who you telling<br/>
While ya'll do everything by the book fuck that I'm rebelling<br/>
Bitch I'm on another level<br/>
A level you ain't seen<br/>
A level that is truly only deemed for a king<br/>
The second you listen it's my mission to murder any rendition<br/>
Busting with precision<br/>
If you in my vision I'm never missing<br/>
Logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener<br/>
Can you motherfuckers feel me?
