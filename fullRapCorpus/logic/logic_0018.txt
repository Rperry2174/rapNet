Welcome, to some shit that's considered legendary<br/>
I'm here to put the rap game in the cemetery<br/>
They told me it couldn't happen<br/>
Ain't no way in hell you gon' make millions off of rapping<br/>
But I'm just so determined<br/>
Catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon<br/>
You know I had to make them realize<br/>
Lights, camera, action, mawfucka check the real in my eyes<br/>
Now they all looking so surprised<br/>
The dawn of a new era, like the sun had arise<br/>
Through these lyrics, I am immortalized<br/>
Strictly spiting the truth but the rest is telling more lies<br/>
This the type of shit most people fantasize<br/>
But this the shit I used to analyze<br/>
They told me I was too underground<br/>
So I took the mic out my basement and found another sound<br/>
I want it, I need it, I'm coming for the crown<br/>
Can't nobody stop me, I'm Rocky let's go another round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Kanye West from "Can't Tell Me Nothing"]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm kinda on my Rockafella meets Nelson Mandela<br/>
Raining money, no umbrella flow<br/>
Most of these people they will never know<br/>
Watchu have to sacrifice as a person to truly grow<br/>
See I'm in love with this shorty right<br/>
But first I gotta get this story right<br/>
Cause in this business love will never last<br/>
Sold out shows, hoes, and a whole lotta ass<br/>
Damn what a concoction<br/>
But these hoes ain't an option<br/>
Cause a woman what I'm looking for<br/>
A girl with wisdom that give me brain so insane<br/>
Or maybe I'm just going insane<br/>
On the road to success, so I'm living in the fast lane
