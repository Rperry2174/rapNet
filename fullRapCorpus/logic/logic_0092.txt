<i>[x2]</i><br/>
When that liquor get po’ up<br/>
And that green get roll up<br/>
When them sets get throwed up<br/>
I’m like naw man, hol’ up<br/>
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff<br/>
Better hope they don’t call my bluff<br/>
Cause my mind is going crazy<br/>
This shit is never enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
Never enough, never enough, never enough<br/>
This shit is never enough<br/>
<br/>
Crush a bit, little bit<br/>
Roll it up, take a hit<br/>
At the party with my homies<br/>
Walk up and they play my shit<br/>
On the road, kick a song<br/>
Didn’t have to sell my soul<br/>
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal<br/>
Where you stay, every day<br/>
Just got my crib in LA<br/>
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ<br/>
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh<br/>
Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck<br/>
Y’all must not know what’s up<br/>
In the cut, we don’t give a fuck<br/>
We just tryna cut<br/>
Line em up, if they say they bout then we’ll sign em up<br/>
Rattpack, that’s a fact<br/>
Basic bitch can’t fuck with that<br/>
Where you at<br/>
That’s what they be asking, I say on the map<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
We are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet<br/>
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it<br/>
Living like we got it cause we get it<br/>
Do it just to say we fucking did it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
When that liquor get po’ up<br/>
And that green get roll up<br/>
When them sets get throwed up<br/>
I’m like naw man, hol’ up<br/>
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff<br/>
Better hope they don’t call my bluff<br/>
Cause my mind is going crazy<br/>
This shit is never enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
Never enough, never enough, never enough<br/>
This shit is never enough<br/>
<br/>
