I'm ready to go and I'm ready to bang<br/>
I'll never be doing the same old thang<br/>
I'll give it my heart so I give it my whole<br/>
I'm ready to stand and I'm ready to fall<br/>
It ain't ever gonna get better, you see?<br/>
Your best homies will become your enemies<br/>
Anger will fill up your whole entity<br/>
Trying to live out the life of a G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Never mistaken I'll never be faking<br/>
I'm givin you wisdom so best get to taking<br/>
Now why in the fuck would I lie? (Fuck would I lie) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I'm giving you everything that you need<br/>
Everything that you need to succeed<br/>
Now why in the fuck would I lie? (Fuck would I lie) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now tell me how you're gonna be a real killa<br/>
Fake mother fucka with a real nine-milla<br/>
Live in a tin but I'm ready to rhyme again, avoid the pain<br/>
Now tell me what I gotta do to maintain<br/>
The mainframe, to keep my life the same<br/>
Not a damn thing 'cause your life needs change<br/>
Psycho-logical know<br/>
How to flow. Stack dough fo' sho<br/>
When I do what I do, I do it for you<br/>
Him, her, over there, you too. Who knew?<br/>
When I ride I do it to make money<br/>
Up in the drop top whippin' when it's sunny<br/>
Gambino flow is how I roll<br/>
All y'all rappers who just don't know<br/>
Your track is preposterous<br/>
My library monstrous<br/>
Y'all know who the bosses is, S-I-R-7<br/>
Breedo, royal, brethren<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
What's up with the honey in the back?<br/>
Shaking what she's got, trying to earn a fat stack<br/>
You're losing your self respect<br/>
Twisting your body, your ass, and your neck<br/>
Used to be a woman, now you're just a bitch<br/>
Your booty is passing by all these good guys<br/>
Tryin' and sewin' some between your thighs<br/>
Fuck that, open your eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
