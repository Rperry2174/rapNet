Now some guys they just hate for no reason, kapish?<br/>
<br/>
Fuck yo money, fuck yo jewelry, fuck yo cars<br/>
Fuck all yo bitches that you got<br/>
It's obsolete, now<br/>
All that shit ain't fresh no more, fuck all that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
On the real homie, on the real<br/>
Tell me how you feel<br/>
Everything I spit is gold like I got a grill<br/>
Bet you people talking thought I'd sell out once I got a deal<br/>
Still me and my team, only difference - we live in the hills<br/>
We living a dream, these bitches perpetrating the skills<br/>
At the soup kitchen with my mama they giving us meals<br/>
I was poor in my adolescence but now I'm getting mills<br/>
Come on, tell me how it feels when that brand new record spills<br/>
Homie this the come up<br/>
I'm from where them drug dealers will run up<br/>
But I was never bout that shit, I just worked till the sun up<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
Claiming that they got it over there<br/>
But they never had it over there<br/>
Homie this the come up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Came a long way, this the come up<br/>
Been a long time coming, it's the come up<br/>
Been a long damn time, it's the come up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Open your mind, this is work ethic<br/>
Ninety-nine percent of you couldn't comprehend the method<br/>
Cause you too wrapped up in the money and bitches<br/>
I get riches but never sacrifice the art<br/>
Been real from the start, now break it down<br/>
That super-duper-killer flow<br/>
All these bitches in here make you wanna kill a ho<br/>
It's kind of funny how the flow make me sound ignant<br/>
But you know the wordplay on another level, isn't it?<br/>
I been at it since a young'n on a dolo<br/>
Till I got a team and sat by the door in a solo<br/>
Bad bitches wanna fuck me on the low though<br/>
Tryna' break the ice she like, "Can I get a photo?"<br/>
A long time comin', what you call that?<br/>
Shorty blowin' up my phone, I promise to call back<br/>
Unless you a crazy ass bitch<br/>
I'm a tell your ass to fall back<br/>
This the come up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
