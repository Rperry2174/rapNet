I would like to make an announcement<br/>
To everybody that said I wouldn't amount to anything<br/>
In the minds of music<br/>
I told you, what did I tell you?<br/>
Didn't I tell you<br/>
Cause I told you<br/>
Mmhmm<br/>
And when did I tell you<br/>
A long time ago<br/>
And what did I say<br/>
What happen when I told you<br/>
Exactly what just happened<br/>
<br/>
I love to jump up on the track<br/>
So poetic with the champagne<br/>
I'm sipping got me spitting moetic<br/>
The second I aim I det it<br/>
Now give me the credit<br/>
Cause I envision myself living in wealth<br/>
Breakfast at Tiffany's<br/>
Lunch at Louis V's<br/>
Now excuse me please<br/>
I got dinner plans overseas<br/>
Killin' with ease<br/>
Young Sinatra got your girl<br/>
And now she a Bobby Soxer<br/>
Girl with nice clothes<br/>
And thick curls
