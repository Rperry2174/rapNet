<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
May I ask in what way your life is contributing to society<br/>
As you sit here day after day after day<br/>
In this dark room, stringing along on that stupid guitar?<br/>
Have you ever thought about that?<br/>
What are you doing for the world or for other people?<br/>
Day after day, hour after hour, night after night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Me and my homies just chillin' feelin' the vibes<br/>
This the time of our lives but many don't realize<br/>
Havin' visions of livin' on another level<br/>
Never signed with the devil,<br/>
The rebel that we fuck around with the treble<br/>
Bumping tribe in the system like penicillin<br/>
Motherfucker I'm killing<br/>
Spittin' venomous never remember this it's like a system<br/>
Say it then I do it I never missed 'em<br/>
Fuck 'em after I kissed 'em<br/>
Sit back and listen my chain, it glisten<br/>
It's like I'm from another dimension<br/>
Did I mention my circles smaller then an intervention<br/>
Then some, beautiful women tell me I'm handsome<br/>
Then I<br/>
Snatch they heart and make they pussy the ransom<br/>
I fuck them until inside they belly burst<br/>
Stop it drop the beat and then we cue the verse<br/>
Spitting lyrics like How a Mac-11 really disperse<br/>
Slaughter MCs and resurrect them when they in the hearse<br/>
They say I got too many styles bitch I've been diverse<br/>
They scared to jump in the cypher I be all up in it first<br/>
My apologies but if you're after me then it gets worse<br/>
When I come through I spit voodoo and leave them cursed<br/>
Common logic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This is the realest<br/>
Only unto the real shall I reveal this<br/>
I even made this beat my self just so y'all could feel this<br/>
From Nasty Nas to Big L to A Tribe Called Quest<br/>
We the Rattpack in other words the tribe that's next<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
It's been a long time<br/>
And I ain't even in my prime<br/>
I remember many moons ago spitting the realest lines<br/>
On the come up<br/>
Matter of fact it was long before that<br/>
Before I bought my first mic, before I could afford that<br/>
This is a letter to the underground the place where I'm from<br/>
This is a letter to the fans that understand what I've done<br/>
And even though I've gotta leave man don't none of y'all grieve<br/>
Cause even in the mainstream that lyricism I breathe<br/>
Some of y'all love my raw records, some of y'all don't<br/>
Some of y'all will love my radio shit, some of y'all won't<br/>
Just like my race, my music has always been yin and yang<br/>
Something for everybody no not just one lane<br/>
And on the real I'll never forget the day I got my deal<br/>
Full creative control and the money was unreal<br/>
Started from the bottom and got here cause of my skill<br/>
And I never set a goal that I didn't plan to fulfill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
You're not any less of a man if you don't pull the trigger<br/>
You're not necessarily a man if you do<br/>
