<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Outside I can hear 'em bussin' bussin'<br/>
And the police they rushin'<br/>
Go to my head like concussion<br/>
I'd rather not have this discussion<br/>
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood<br/>
Where my mind, don’t know now<br/>
But I know where it was<br/>
I need Nikki, where is Nikki<br/>
Baby girl please come and get me now<br/>
I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that god is with me<br/>
This that baby mama drama<br/>
Give a fuck about a man I know Imma<br/>
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun<br/>
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month<br/>
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt<br/>
That welfare check, won’t ever bounce like my daddy did<br/>
But I’m glad he did cause it made me strong<br/>
Made me help somebody with this song<br/>
Paint the picture of my life<br/>
Growing up what it was like<br/>
Section 8, grab a plate<br/>
Food for thought, gravitate<br/>
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away<br/>
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today<br/>
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that’s all I know<br/>
Just me and my homies, people that know me<br/>
Only ones that know<br/>
Around my way, living day by day<br/>
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs<br/>
5 O with them canines<br/>
Manhunt when it's game time<br/>
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day<br/>
Now I’m running from the police, don’t know how but I got away<br/>
Selling weed to my homies, and a girl in the building that know me<br/>
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen<br/>
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean<br/>
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do<br/>
Such a youngin, such a fool<br/>
Now I’m breaking into school<br/>
Cause my homie told me to<br/>
What to do, what would you<br/>
When will I lose my anonymity and become one with the enemy?<br/>
Tell me would I be the enemy, feel like nobody in front of me<br/>
I can feel the vibe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Bobby what are you thinking?<br/>
What are you dreaming about?<br/>
Bobby, what’s inside?<br/>
What are you thinking right now?<br/>
What are you thinking?<br/>
Go to sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I guess that I was just thinking things would be different now<br/>
Cause when I wake up my dreams fade<br/>
Everything cascade<br/>
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames<br/>
Why must I open my eyes<br/>
I wish that I could stay asleep forever<br/>
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever<br/>
Will it happen, maybe never<br/>
Maybe so, I got to know<br/>
But tell me why<br/>
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming<br/>
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons<br/>
Maybe not<br/>
All I know is this life I live I can’t live it no longer<br/>
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive<br/>
Turn on the TV let it wash my brain<br/>
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain<br/>
Hello children, how was school?<br/>
It was good, how bout you?<br/>
I love you (I love you son)<br/>
I love mama too<br/>
Are you ready for dinner? I’m able to set the table<br/>
Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off and I realize I’m back in hell<br/>
(Bobby)<br/>
