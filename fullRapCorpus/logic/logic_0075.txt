Yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
It's funny how your role model gets outdated, becomes the old model<br/>
At the hotel, asking for mo' bottles<br/>
Ménage et plus one - I'm fucking fo' models<br/>
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle<br/>
Murci-lago, whipping through Chicago<br/>
All these beautiful women follow wherever I go<br/>
Million-dollar deals on the table<br/>
Just a couple years ago I couldn't pay for cable<br/>
Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel<br/>
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label<br/>
Plus Def Jam, know who I am<br/>
I'm that motherfucker that do it just 'cause I can<br/>
Now I'm on a level that your elevator can't reach<br/>
I've got information that the school system doesn't teach<br/>
I've got verses that your Sunday service wouldn't dare to preach<br/>
Second-coming-of-Christ flow, they like, "Whoa!"<br/>
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul<br/>
And changed your mind like I'm penetrating your skull<br/>
I seen shit John Lennon couldn't imagine<br/>
Just me and a mic on a main stage, spazzing<br/>
It's the type of shit normal people can't even fathom<br/>
So much swag, kiss your bitch and she orgasms<br/>
I'm hazardous, you would have sworn I was from Nazareth<br/>
I'm resurrecting hip-hop like it was Lazarus<br/>
<br/>
Step to the mic and they gon' dread it like Weezy<br/>
Man this industry is so damn greasy<br/>
Swaggin' on the track, they say I sound like Yeezy<br/>
But I don't give a fuck cause gettin' money too easy<br/>
21st century, doing something mean to it<br/>
Play this in the south and everybody gonna lean to it<br/>
"Greatest of all time" has got a nice ring to it<br/>
We do it for the music, money ain't a thing to us<br/>
Been shining muhfucka what's bling to us<br/>
Most loved, most hated at the same time<br/>
Star player in this bitch and it's game time<br/>
Who you know lyrically killed the club in the same rhyme?<br/>
They call me Logic, motherfucker, better know the name<br/>
I spit crack like Pusha (Yuugh!), Novocaine<br/>
We never dumb it down, you know we just numb it down<br/>
And watch you get up in your feelings when we come around<br/>
Grew up on section 8, you probably can't relate<br/>
‘Cause y'all just watched the throne, I'm tryna checkmate<br/>
I been shinin since before I brought them diamonds in, and<br/>
They talk that shit, they talk that shit, it's so astonishing<br/>
Y'all better swallow that pride like a klonopin<br/>
Cause I can lay tracks with my eyes closed, Chinaman<br/>
<br/>
Got a show in LA Sunday, then New York Monday<br/>
Looking at the BET cypher like I'll be there one day<br/>
It's the Roc reincarnated, we call it Visionary<br/>
Fuck the world 'til I'm on top, we call that missionary<br/>
The game's on pause, it need to load again<br/>
These rappers is reruns and we need a new episode again<br/>
Yeah, well motherfucker, this the pilot<br/>
So fly I recorded this on the PJ next to the pilot on a CB<br/>
Now you see me on the TV<br/>
Said this would happen back in the day but you ain't believe me<br/>
So um, I'mma keep rising to the top<br/>
Never stop and finger fuck the world 'til the day my album drop
