Okay now this how I'm feeling, lately I'm like the villain<br/>
Cause while they on that other shit I been posted, out here chillin'<br/>
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5<br/>
You know this that shit that you bumpin' in your whip while you drive<br/>
I've been living life, and I hope that you do the same<br/>
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame<br/>
Come on I've been through the game, 'bout time that they know my name<br/>
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine<br/>
Lord Willin' we over came, it's time to get over man<br/>
I've been around the world and back and I swear it's all the same<br/>
And what I learned, a prophet don't do it for the profit gone get off<br/>
Check the topic watch me drop it, can you top it<br/>
I don't know I've been at it on the low<br/>
Never did it like this here before<br/>
But I'm still here and I just hope I'll make a difference make a killin'<br/>
<br/>
Lord willin'<br/>
Lord willin'<br/>
Make a difference, lord willin'<br/>
Uh, lord willin'<br/>
I tell 'em hold on<br/>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br/>
And I tell 'em hold on<br/>
I don't understand what's happening<br/>
And so I tell 'em hold on<br/>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br/>
And I tell 'em hold on<br/>
I don't understand what's happening<br/>
So I tell em<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm back at it, I ain't done, I ain't had it<br/>
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic<br/>
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic<br/>
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic<br/>
Yes sir I've done this shit before like your baby momma momma<br/>
I'mma tell 'em like it is, I'mma tell 'em like it is<br/>
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop<br/>
I'm well up I'm way up, nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up<br/>
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions<br/>
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'<br/>
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way, but no not quite like this<br/>
Live it like that in a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this<br/>
Not quite like this on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel<br/>
Are you listening?, I hope that you're listening<br/>
This feel like it's summertime, waiting for the bus number nine<br/>
Through the city all alone, not a worry, not your phone<br/>
We just vibing maybe flying 'round the world<br/>
Man, I hope you see the world<br/>
And all your dreams will unfurl, just don't never cash your pearl<br/>
Go out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'<br/>
Make a difference make a killin', make a killin'<br/>
<br/>
Lord willin'<br/>
Lord willin'<br/>
Make a difference, lord willin'<br/>
Uh, lord willin'<br/>
I tell 'em hold on<br/>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br/>
And I tell 'em hold on<br/>
I don't understand what's happening<br/>
And so I tell 'em hold on<br/>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<br/>
And I tell 'em hold on<br/>
I don't understand what's happening<br/>
So I tell em
