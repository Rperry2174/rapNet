Oh, oh, ah<br/>
Take it, take it, take it<br/>
Take it slow<br/>
Take it, take it, take it<br/>
Take it slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Shawty I don't know you<br/>
But you know I'm trying to get to<br/>
Know you think I'm fine but my mind that's what gets you<br/>
Late night conversations ain't no way I'm gon' forget you<br/>
So let me lay you down, baby girl let me split you<br/>
Yes you know I want it but first time I'll get to know you<br/>
Cause this ain't about your body take my hand and let me show you<br/>
Now what we have is partnership I won't try to control you<br/>
I just want to ride, I just want to fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
I just want to take it slow<br/>
Baby you already know<br/>
I just want to take it slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Baby girl I think I really want to speed it up<br/>
Lay you in the bed, kiss slow let me heat it up<br/>
But I promise I'll be gentle when I beat it up<br/>
Never do it on the regular but I'mma eat it up<br/>
Kiss you, touch you, tease you<br/>
Doing anything and everything I need to please you<br/>
What it is, momma let me know right now<br/>
Ain't no need to talk I just want to bite down<br/>
On your bottom lip, let your bra rip open<br/>
Never had a feeling like this and I'm hoping<br/>
We could do it again, never thought I could find heaven within<br/>
A heart of a woman and now I begin<br/>
To understand more than I did from the start<br/>
Gimme your heart, trust me with love<br/>
Baby girl that's where you fell from above<br/>
Lend me your hand, I'll be your man<br/>
I promise to do everything that I can<br/>
I'll be your Sinatra, be my Monroe<br/>
Give me your heart and I'll know it will grow<br/>
I put it on everything baby my love is yours for the taking, my darling, my drug<br/>
And now I know, and now I know<br/>
<br/>
