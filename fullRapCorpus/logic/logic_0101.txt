All day (all day), everyday (everyday)<br/>
We was on that block until we made a way<br/>
Day to day, man that's the only way<br/>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br/>
<br/>
Fade away, fade away<br/>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br/>
(Way, way, way), fade away<br/>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br/>
<br/>
I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that<br/>
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back<br/>
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kid, gotta get my son back<br/>
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you<br/>
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday<br/>
Drop into work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day<br/>
I know, I'mma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce<br/>
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit<br/>
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah<br/>
Yes I'mma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'mma ride in the dead of it yeah<br/>
Yeah I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable<br/>
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away<br/>
<br/>
Fade away, fade away<br/>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br/>
(Way, way, way), fade away<br/>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this<br/>
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this<br/>
So I might just, might just, I don't know<br/>
Reinvention, that's my intention, want so much more than this third-dimension<br/>
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture - no metaphor<br/>
I’m being real with ya but it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"<br/>
Going HAM, full of all of them in a spaceship, I’m in another system<br/>
So futuristic, on another mission but back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen<br/>
Livin' my life - no inhibition, life to death with no intermission<br/>
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain<br/>
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when inside the frame<br/>
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer<br/>
When ya get to heaven I'mma come and get ya<br/>
Sit back and really get the picture<br/>
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away<br/>
But one thing I know day to day, I'mma do somethin' 'fore I fade away<br/>
<br/>
Fade away, fade away<br/>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br/>
(Way, way, way), fade away<br/>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Kai:]</i> So she can actually hold a conversation?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Yeah. Ask her yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> Uhh, what am I thinking, Thalia?<br/>

<i>[Thalia:]</i> Sure thing, Thomas. Would you like a -distorted- or something a little more exotic?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> Holy shit!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Told you, man. The upgrade’s crazy. Thalia, revert last command and run simulation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thalia:]</i> Running simulation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> Man, what the hell is that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Well, you can pick anyone in history, and based off a collection of data, it allows you to personally speak with them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> Anybody?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Anybody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> Thalia, do Big Sean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Alright, let me get this straight. You can speak with anyone in recorded history, like Jesus, Steve Jobs, Einstein, and you pick Big Sean?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kai:]</i> Man, fuck yeah! That’s my dog!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thomas:]</i> Okay. Thalia, simulate Big Sean<br/>

<i>[Kai:]</i> Yeah, I'mma have to upgrade my shit
