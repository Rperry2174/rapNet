<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tryna get it like me, can't get it like me<br/>
Tryna get it like, like me<br/>
Tryna get it like, can't get it like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Chillin on the west side bringing out my best side<br/>
Where they only care about bitches and how big they breast size is<br/>
Yes I is on the come up gearing all you on the run up<br/>
Cuz you know I'm finna one up muthafucka uh<br/>
Pull up in the Benz while the homie smoking medical <br/>
Only bring your friends if them bitches look identical<br/>
The pinnacle of what we doing they know we're around<br/>
Started from the ground, always gotta hold it down<br/>
Now they think they got it cuz they signed up on the dotted<br/>
But there's only so much money in the kid that gets allotted<br/>
Plus you probably don't even know how it is divided <br/>
Muthafucka I got it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Acting like they got it but they really don't<br/>
Bitches say they love me but they really don't<br/>
Shut the fuck up and get out my face hoe (fuck out my face)<br/>
Talking all that shit but you don't really know<br/>
Put that pen to pad and watch em talk about it <br/>
All I know is real life, they don't give a fuck about it<br/>
Take ya chain, ya bitch, ya car get the fuck up out it (uh)<br/>
Real is on the rise, all of yall demise<br/>
This is who I am so ain't no need for a disguise<br/>
I have been advised, by the greatest that made it to do it<br/>
Living legend's richest never knew it<br/>
This record was written right before I got on the stage<br/>
My mind racing reciting lyrics from pen to page<br/>
Bitch I bet I record this record on the radar <br/>
Just because I said I was a Jedi, bust like Beretta <br/>
Now feel my penetration, no hesitation <br/>
This is warfare<br/>
Like a realer banana this get me iller<br/>
Fuck a feeling, this is the realist the symphony<br/>
Ima kill these epiphanies I can feel this<br/>
But you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Casey Veggies - Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Can't get it like me, I'm a real young winner<br/>
Might take you out to dinner<br/>
Tryna hit it all night, I put that on me<br/>
Baby girl gon' feel it I know she about the business<br/>
If she want it then she know she about to get it<br/>
Throw some D's on that bitch, pull up in that Audi Coup feeling like Hercules in a whip<br/>
Cuz I'm dealing it, got it off the dealership<br/>
We be throwing hard no muthafuckin censorship<br/>
Beezy can't squash how they tell what the dealy is<br/>
She gon roll with us like she need a ride to the crib (word)<br/>
She influenced me to go hard, shout out to my niggas that's gon go hard<br/>
We gon get the private player that just be the logic<br/>
Put my hands together, pray, then I doze off<br/>
<br/>
