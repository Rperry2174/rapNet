<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Living good, I've been living good<br/>
Rolling through my hood, understood<br/>
Just a younging in this bitch up to no good<br/>
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me<br/>
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties<br/>
Out the blue, like a Crip<br/>
But I never bang though, they know<br/>
We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the fame)<br/>
We've been at it way before the fame, ho (Way before the)<br/>
We've been at it way before the fame, psych<br/>
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it<br/>
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch<br/>
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit<br/>
No ain't just tryna hit, get, get with this<br/>
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do<br/>
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue<br/>
I'm coming through<br/>
If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do<br/>
We ain't never switch it up, we keep it true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Out the blue, like a Crip<br/>
But I never bang though<br/>
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho<br/>
Way before the fame, ho<br/>
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br/>
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)<br/>
Way before the fame (Bounce)<br/>
Way before the fame (Bounce)<br/>
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)<br/>
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame<br/>
We've been at it way before the fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Back again, like I never left<br/>
Had to take a breath<br/>
Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore<br/>
God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam<br/>
They know who I am<br/>
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce<br/>
Fuck it, make it count<br/>
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa<br/>
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla<br/>
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross<br/>
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world<br/>
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl<br/>
RattPack, know the deal<br/>
What's the motto? Keep it real!<br/>
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it<br/>
We live in an era where it get deleted<br/>
I'm wondering if Imma make it<br/>
Man fuck it I'll take it, that record I'll break it<br/>
These bitches they love it, but I never covet<br/>
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing<br/>
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living<br/>
Don't know what I'm given<br/>
It's so hard not to give in<br/>
