<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah, this is my vision<br/>
Written without second thought or revision<br/>
The type of shit that affect you like an oncoming collision<br/>
That just make you freeze, drop to your knees and beg em;<br/>
Please lord forgive me for gripping a semi now<br/>
When searching for God all I ever do is stare up<br/>
While Satan sending me women wearing nothing but they hair up<br/>
Got the condom on the dresser, I can't wait to undress her<br/>
Would you think lesser of me if I did it?<br/>
Cause I get lonely, I'm human, and boy it's been a minute<br/>
Fresh out the states, surrounded by women that wanna hit it<br/>
But should I take the pussy just cause I could get it?<br/>
Or do I want something that's more committed?<br/>
God damn, it's hard to admit it<br/>
As you focus on the little things, the bigger ones will get you<br/>
So I minimize the negatives to see the bigger picture<br/>
I get richer while you fuckers hate,<br/>
So keep it up and watch a young brother elevate<br/>
I'm black and white but racism I still cannot evade<br/>
I never understood the concept, even to this day<br/>
You know we're all the same in the eyes of a blade<br/>
Because when men share blood it's to the same shade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Logic]</i><br/>
That's why I'm just a man homie<br/>
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man<br/>
But I don't think they understand homie<br/>
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man<br/>
Y'all think I'm more than just a man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
I contemplate on the daily if I'll survive and strive<br/>
To be the greatest lyricist dead or alive<br/>
I gotta prevail<br/>
That's my word like excel<br/>
Went from a small town in West Deer Park to XXL<br/>
Now we shopping at Louis V, back in the day it was Ross<br/>
They calling me the savior, hope they don't give me the cross<br/>
Now that's the realest shit you ever heard<br/>
Never in the streets but I was closer than the curb<br/>
Do you feel me?<br/>
Whole world wanna kill me<br/>
Signed a deal but I'm still me<br/>
In five years will I still be?<br/>
Ever since I was a youngin this is all I've ever wanted<br/>
Always kept it real while they perpetrated and fronted<br/>
I was in the studio while they was gettin' blunted<br/>
Always have my doubts but deep down I knew I'd run it<br/>
Sportin' Armani like menage a trois that's double breasted<br/>
A lot of time I've invested and never once have I rested<br/>
Feeling nervous like when you getting tested<br/>
The game is over saturated, completely infested<br/>
The greatest story ever told, realest song ever written<br/>
To hell with a Plan B, motherfucker I ain't kiddin<br/>
I''m just trying to get this money, I'm just trying to get paid<br/>
That's the type of mentality put careers in the grave<br/>
Fuck how much you made<br/>
What's it worth if your memory fades?<br/>
Now I ain't perfect, on occasion I'm strayed<br/>
It's been forever since I prayed<br/>
And I guess today is the day,<br/>
So I step in the booth and treat that shit like a confession<br/>
Thinking back as I reminisce,<br/>
Wondering; does God even exist?<br/>
A man of faith but mentally I feel at risk<br/>
What you want from me, where am I supposed to go?<br/>
Seems like you never talk, tell me how I'm supposed to know?<br/>
I'm just a man, I ain't perfect<br/>
Is this life even worth it?<br/>
It's time to dig up the past so fuck it let's unearth it<br/>
Like my childhood, living free like a child should<br/>
Remember the time I opened the bedroom door crack?<br/>
And saw my daddy smoking more crack?<br/>
No food in my house, we just couldn't afford that<br/>
Momma drinking, sleeping until five<br/>
But she always seemed to get up whenever men arrived<br/>
Feeling alone at like eleven<br/>
Segregated from the other kids like it was 1957<br/>
I've loved, I've hated, I've cried, I've died inside<br/>
I've resurrected but don't neglect that I've modified<br/>
I'm stronger, faster, better than ever before<br/>
And everything I've been through can honestly assure<br/>
I'm no less, no more,<br/>
<br/>
