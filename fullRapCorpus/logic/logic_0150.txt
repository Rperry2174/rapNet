<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah fast cars with iPods in them<br/>
Young Sinatra what they blastin like a beretta<br/>
V for Vendetta, bitches sit and play to get wetter<br/>
Haters talking shit but then they study every letter<br/>
I'm the first draft pick with the last laugh bitch<br/>
See I'm angry on the track but I deserve to be<br/>
Cause all these rappers with no talent wanna murder me<br/>
You've been talking shit ain't even heard of me<br/>
I went from park benches at night, to first class flights<br/>
Yeah, that's what you call takin' shit to new heights<br/>
Put the 750 in reverse like Benjamin Button<br/>
We've been doing it for years and they down all of a sudden<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Logic]</i><br/>
Bobbysoxer doing 120 in the corvette<br/>
Watch your boy blow up in front of your eyes, war vet<br/>
Give a fan nothin' but fire, now they want more of it<br/>
Everybody want my album it ain't in stores yet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
I keep it real all the time like my crew<br/>
When I rhyme just to kill it in it's prime<br/>
With that predator state of mind, I'm set to detonate<br/>
Stack my bread and watch the paper escalate<br/>
Don't test my fate, Logic finna blow like Mary Kate<br/>
I play my role like Shakespeare<br/>
Ratt Pack ain't no fakes here<br/>
I conceal my talent like a 357<br/>
And ever since I was 11 I've been a G<br/>
Chillin on the low key, incognito<br/>
Manipulate the steel like Magneto<br/>
Smacking suckers like mosquitoes<br/>
Dispersing verses like a kilo<br/>
I'm Michael, the king, you fuckas is Tito<br/>
Versace frames with the green shades I only see dope<br/>
Falling like a free throw you know my stylo<br/>
I once was a prince with the vision of a king<br/>
Now I run the whole thing not defined by the bling<br/>
Exterminate the fakes like crooked Jakes, killing for high stakes<br/>
Guarantee it is my fate to be, remembered as one of the greats<br/>
No matter what it takes boy I'm a give it my all<br/>
Like Jordan when he balled, never stumbled never fall lyrical medicine<br/>
Repeat the formula until I get it right like Edison (Edison)<br/>
Now step into my mind as I calculate lyrics like Einstein<br/>
The way he manipulated numbers I manipulate the rhymes<br/>
Like E=MC squared nah<br/>
E= Eater of MCs beware<br/>
Watch me shine in the darkness like a flare<br/>
Married to the game, I'm the heir to the throne you been watching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Logic]</i><br/>
Bobbysoxer doing 120 in the corvette<br/>
Watch your boy blow up in front of your eyes, war vet<br/>
Give a fan nothin' but fire, now they want more of it<br/>
Everybody want my album it ain't in stores yet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
Walk into a room and they staring at a brother like<br/>
What up, what's the next move, should I improve<br/>
On some shit I never gave a fuck about before<br/>
Let relationships end up cause all I do is flow<br/>
See I'm a selfish motherfucker I already know<br/>
Don't try to tell me what I'm not<br/>
Bitch I'll conquer the globe<br/>
I sacrificed my whole childhood to explode<br/>
I want this more than what's under Mila Kunis' robe<br/>
Meanwhile Daddy's lil' girl asking for more money<br/>
But little did he know the bread was for blow money<br/>
What's in store, money, soldout shows and hoes fo me<br/>
I can't fade, this the only reason I was made<br/>
To follow my dreams and manipulate these rhyme schemes like a genius spittin the meanest<br/>
I done seen this as a child 10, 000 people in the crowd<br/>
Reppin the Ratt Pack watch em all go wild
