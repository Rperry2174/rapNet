I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though<br/>
Brothers on the corners selling crack like it was nada though<br/>
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor<br/>
Police banging on the door<br/>
While gripping the.44<br/>
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before<br/>
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro<br/>
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and heat flow<br/>
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow<br/>
I just wanna keep the peace, and help people<br/>
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people<br/>
So if you hatin' on me goddamn you evil<br/>
And just don't understand cause I'm flyer than Knievel<br/>
Been through a lot of shit, but I keep it on the D-Lo<br/>
Never bustin' in'em streets but I keep it G though<br/>
I ain't in a fairy tale, I'm just me, ho!<br/>
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know<br/>
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast<br/>
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece<br/>
I just kill'em with kindness, yeah we leave 'em deceased<br/>
And tell it like it is and now you got it capish shorty waddup!<br/>
<br/>
Let me bring it back down<br/>
You think it's a game right now (yeah)<br/>
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)<br/>
Back where I came from now<br/>
We're gon' live it up<br/>
Till we bring it back down<br/>
<br/>
Let me bring it back down<br/>
You think it's a game right now (yeah)<br/>
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)<br/>
Back where I came from now<br/>
We're gon' live it up<br/>
Till we bring it back down<br/>
<br/>
I hope you live a long life hatin'<br/>
And watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh<br/>
So successful they'll probably say I signed with Satan<br/>
But I got God on my side, always down to ride<br/>
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least<br/>
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease<br/>
Matter fact like a geneticist<br/>
These rappers' records comin' out they so repetitive<br/>
Shout out my Homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars<br/>
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars<br/>
It's all love, man that shit is ours<br/>
They never thought I'd make a shooting from the stars<br/>
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a cold world<br/>
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl<br/>
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah<br/>
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though<br/>
Keep it Rattpack, till the beat go<br/>
You might not get the flow now, let it seek though<br/>
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor<br/>
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio<br/>
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant<br/>
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it<br/>
I don't give a fuck, my mind stays celibate<br/>
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich<br/>
Out the blue like elephants<br/>
My flow is so elegant<br/>
Death before dishonor<br/>
Murder all rappers in front of they momma's<br/>
I rip Artanis<br/>
Decipher the word because it's eubonics<br/>
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra<br/>
Yes, I got you bitch it's Logic<br/>
<br/>
Let me bring it back down<br/>
You think it's a game right now (yeah)<br/>
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (yeah)<br/>
Back where I came from now<br/>
We're gon' live it up<br/>
Till we bring it back down
