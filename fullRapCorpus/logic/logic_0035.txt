Various women I'm swimming in like a shark<br/>
Hold up, that was the first one<br/>
Let me run it back and restart<br/>
Young Sinatra ripping the beat apart<br/>
Shining like a diamond<br/>
When I be rhyming<br/>
But y'all in the dark<br/>
On point like a poisonous dart<br/>
I can feel it now<br/>
The fame is coming soon<br/>
How can sky be the limit when there's footprints on the moon<br/>
Now, I used to buss tables now I bust rhymes<br/>
Spitting lines to the illest of dimes<br/>
Just to pass the time<br/>
Living like a Don<br/>
Mafietic mind state<br/>
Hip Hop heads never die we multiply then dominate<br/>
Now I been flowing since a adolescent up until the present<br/>
Rehearsing flows for various shows<br/>
Yeah that's how I roll<br/>
Getting respect and never neglect<br/>
That as I infect... and when I dissect<br/>
Rip it and wreck it now<br/>
That's on the record<br/>
As the vinyl spin so slowly<br/>
Bringing verses like a holy<br/>
Bible, my flow is tribal<br/>
Meet me in the street homie I'm liable<br/>
To get it right then and there<br/>
Mother fuckers like where<br/>
He come from<br/>
Got music for days and then some<br/>
They were stepping confident until I made 'em run<br/>
You know it's Logic<br/>
In your vacinity murder evil entities<br/>
Better known as your enemies<br/>
You feel it now<br/>
Spark the L and you be coolin'<br/>
Chillin' relaxin' to this audio satisfaction<br/>
I beat MC's tested in action<br/>
Leave you gashin<br/>
From a thousand lashes<br/>
Why I'm laughing with a passion<br/>
Standing over you smiling<br/>
Til I hear sirens then I'm dashing<br/>
<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
... broke the bottle<br/>
Coulda struck the lotto<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
Got rhymes 365 days and plus some<br/>
<br/>
This second verse is dedicated to rappers that never made it<br/>
Cause they gave up on their dream<br/>
In other words they hesitated to take it<br/>
But I swear I'm a make it better than ever before<br/>
Cause half of y'all don't even know<br/>
See I be rolling through the streets<br/>
In a beamer bomber like Hiroshima<br/>
Gonna hit you like a train until they like Damn Gina<br/>
I eat MCs like fast food<br/>
Hella rude<br/>
I'm the reason that your favorite rapper's in a bad mood<br/>
My name is Logic<br/>
I was born in 1990<br/>
Ain't no need to remind me<br/>
That when you listen you wanna rewind me<br/>
All the labels wanna sign me<br/>
For the right reason<br/>
We aim to please<br/>
Hunting dollars and it's buck season<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
That's why we get high.
