Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now<br/>
Sit the fuck back down<br/>
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood<br/>
Oh it's like that now?<br/>
I'm a show you mothafuckas how to act now<br/>
I'm a show em how to act<br/>
I'm a show em how to act<br/>
<br/>
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round<br/>
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man<br/>
Run, mothafucka, run<br/>
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!<br/>
Everybody know you ain't about it<br/>
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it<br/>
Red light, stop. Green light, go!<br/>
Everything ain't what it seem like<br/>
Mothafucka I know!<br/>
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?<br/>
Bitch I been in<br/>
This is merely the beginning again<br/>
What you been living in?<br/>
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?<br/>
Looking for something to complete us<br/>
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist<br/>
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us<br/>
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus<br/>
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us<br/>
And I wish I could erase that, face facts<br/>
<br/>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br/>
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go<br/>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br/>
Everybody love, everybody know<br/>
<br/>
I been knockin doors down like a Jehovah witness<br/>
God as my witness, I'm with this<br/>
But on the real I think I need another witness!<br/>
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing<br/>
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga<br/>
Well I'll be God damned, go figure<br/>
In my blood is the slave and the master<br/>
It's like the devil playin spades with the pastor<br/>
But he was born with the white privilege!<br/>
Man what the fuck is that?<br/>
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin with his toys<br/>
I should be ashamed to be black<br/>
And some black people look ashamed when I rap<br/>
Like my great granddaddy didn't take a whip to the back<br/>
Not accepted by the black or the white<br/>
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light<br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that<br/>
Wish I could erase that, face facts<br/>
<br/>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br/>
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go<br/>
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something<br/>
Everybody love, everybody know<br/>
<br/>
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now<br/>
Sit the fuck back down<br/>
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood<br/>
Oh it's like that now?<br/>
I'm a show you mothafuckas how to act now<br/>
I'm a show em how to act<br/>
I'm a show em how to act
