<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Oh, I can't wait to say<br/>
I can't wait to say<br/>
Bitch I made it<br/>
Yeahh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Just a youngin' with a dream<br/>
Both his parents were some fiends<br/>
Living life behind the scenes<br/>
He was destined for that cream<br/>
Smoking weed, sipping liquor, skipping school<br/>
Falling quicker as he elevates with fame<br/>
All the haters they gonna bicker<br/>
Yeah, but little did he know<br/>
He was set to detonate and surely blow<br/>
That's just how the story go<br/>
Motivated just to flow<br/>
White boy with the soul of a strong negro<br/>
Let them know daddy black mamma white that's how he roll<br/>
Will he drink from the coloreds?<br/>
Will he sip from the whites?<br/>
1950s, why they fighting, fuck them both that shit ain't right<br/>
Now, raised with killers<br/>
Wolves and drug dealers<br/>
Living on food stamps and sleeping on dirty pillows<br/>
Thinking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm living every rappers dream<br/>
Motivated by my team<br/>
Now let's take it back a bit<br/>
2006, that was the scene<br/>
Spilling ink upon my paper<br/>
High as a sky scraper<br/>
Now I'm spitting so hot that I'm salivating vapor<br/>
Forced to be reckoned<br/>
Spitting at a million mother fucking words per second<br/>
With punches like Tekken<br/>
The moment the mic beckons<br/>
This is everything, all I got<br/>
And I'm a be rhyming until they drop the casket<br/>
I mastered impeccable flows that could not be captured<br/>
The God of this rap shit<br/>
I just raptured the game<br/>
I'm the man<br/>
And you might think I'm cocky but that's not me<br/>
I say that I'm the best to envision what I want<br/>
While you partied getting' drunk<br/>
I wrote endlessly for months<br/>
Now I got so many rhyme books they can't fit inside my trunk<br/>
Now I got so many rhyme books they can't fit inside my trunk<br/>
Like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
A natural born killer<br/>
Egotistical pistol packing mystical blood spiller<br/>
When that full moon hit<br/>
Run the mic and I'm a leave the room lit<br/>
For the people that never gave a shit<br/>
I'm a give the world hit after hit<br/>
This is my destiny<br/>
Recipe for success is the best of me<br/>
Thank God for blessing me<br/>
With a life in this hip-hop world<br/>
And the moment that it all unfurl<br/>
Ain't no way that I'm looking back<br/>
You know I live for this, die for this<br/>
Laugh for this and I cry for this<br/>
Hip-hop metropolis<br/>
Ain't no one toppin' this<br/>
Haters ain't stoppin' this<br/>
Moment I'm droppin' this<br/>
Fans will be coppin' this<br/>
Take a moment let it sit and hall of fame is where I'm headed<br/>
Set to detonate and bitch I'm blowing up like Armageddon<br/>
<br/>
