<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>

<br/>
Baby girl, you know what I want<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Let me get it right now<br/>
Let me get you aroused<br/>
Baby you been on my mind for a while now<br/>
I just wanna take some time<br/>
Write this rhyme<br/>
With a beautiful woman like you in mind<br/>
Baby be mine<br/>
I'm trying to find what makes you tic, can we talk<br/>
Maybe walk around the park<br/>
Trust me girl I stand up hard<br/>
All women ain't bitches and all<br/>
Men aren't dawgs even though we bark<br/>
Cause I just want to get to know you<br/>
Maybe run around and show you<br/>
What a gentlemen is<br/>
Yeah, tell me what it do<br/>
Shawty I'm coming for you<br/>
Ain't talking about sex<br/>
I'm talking about something from above<br/>
I'm talking about love<br/>
Talking bout love, love, love (love)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Now that you know that I'm for real<br/>
It's the perfect time to kill<br/>
Any fear that you may have<br/>
Baby girl I won't be mad if you ain't feeling it<br/>
But if you down you better believe I'm killing it<br/>
Take it to the crib on that late night drilling it<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Wait a second, hold up<br/>
How you think I got this name<br/>
I'm all about the brain<br/>
Why you think they call me (Logic)<br/>
Ok, condom in my pocket<br/>
Lay on the bed let me rock it<br/>
Please don't stop the spit from profit<br/>
But this right here on the house<br/>
Fuck the bed, we cutting on the floor then later on the couch<br/>
Ladies give out 'till I gets it in<br/>
Make you scream and make you grin<br/>
From the very beginning from the second I'm in<br/>
I'm trying to tease you let me please you<br/>
Baby girl you know I need you<br/>
Do you like it, never had it<br/>
Putting work with this one right here<br/>
Yeah you know it's just for fun<br/>
Give it to you like I was trying to conceive a son<br/>
I gets it done then I'm ready for more<br/>
Ain't no telling where we'll go<br/>
But one thing that I know fo sho<br/>
This angel has no halo<br/>
I don't play no games<br/>
You can ask my ex I never eat the box<br/>
But if I control her I may select some freaky shit to start<br/>
Then bring it back<br/>
We can go for hours girl I never slept<br/>
Tell me how you want it<br/>
Face to face or rough and from the deck<br/>
Just like that she gon' overwork me if I let her<br/>
But I don't give a damn I just wanna feel better (ay)<br/>
<br/>
