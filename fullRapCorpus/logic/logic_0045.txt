<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone<br/>
I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white<br/>
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that<br/>
We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery<br/>
We don't want to hate and despise one another<br/>
In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone<br/>
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way<br/>
Greed has poisoned men's souls<br/>
<br/>
Sinatra<br/>
'Sinatra shot ya', God damn you'<br/>
'Is this what you want?'<br/>
Logic<br/>
'You are watching a master at work'<br/>
'You have interfered with our affairs for the last time'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons<br/>
Fans telling me never change, but it's harder fighting seasons<br/>
They hear me on the radio and now they yelling 'Treason!'<br/>
Cause Logic giving them mainstream verses like Ephesians<br/>
But, I never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow<br/>
There's a time and place for everything so what the fuck you yelling for?<br/>
The fame hit me quicker than previously determined<br/>
Rat Pack, real all the time, fuck a vermin<br/>
Motivated by money, sex, drugs and violence<br/>
Cause the era that we living, it was built up on defiance<br/>
What we need is alliance, but y'all don't really hear me though<br/>
So, hip-hop's a chariot and Logic's finna carry it<br/>
Stallion, coming for their necks like a medallion<br/>
Straight out of Sierra Leone<br/>
Motherfuckers it's on, I'm under your skin like cortisone<br/>
99% of these motherfuckers is bullshit<br/>
But I'm on that Bull shit, Michael Jordan<br/>
Cutting records after the show at my hotel while I'm touring<br/>
Yeah, and I ain't even 23<br/>
But my bank account can vouch, I'm balling like an MVP<br/>
Yes it's me, L-O-G-I-C, I'm repping MD<br/>
Now what the fuck is a vacation? I see no satisfaction<br/>
I work 12 hours a day, every day with no distraction<br/>
7 days a week and 12 hours, that's a lazy day<br/>
Going 74 hours with no sleep, call that a crazy day<br/>
This is Manhunt, and I ain't stopping 'til y'all apprehended<br/>
Many years I have attended and finally been commended<br/>
For keeping it real so finger fuck whoever I've offended<br/>
Now, pull out the Mac and watch them freeze like PCs<br/>
I'm Celsius, never graduated so fuck degrees<br/>
I educate 'em with ease, however listener please<br/>
Don't knock that last line, school it just wasn't for me<br/>
We all different, and I'm here to make a killing<br/>
So say hello to the villain cause in this day that we living<br/>
And the nice guys finish last, I'm blowing up<br/>
Guess you could say I'm having a blast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
'Sinatra shot ya', God damn you'<br/>
'You are watching a master at work'<br/>
'Is this what you want?'
