East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows<br/>
Everyone knows, everyone knows<br/>
East side, west side, we ride, we die, everyone knows<br/>
Everyone knows, everyone knows<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights, no lights, all for this<br/>
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside, no ride in the wintertime all for this<br/>
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank<br/>
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this<br/>
Ex you out, get solved with this... everybody know I...<br/>
<br/>
I'm a slave<br/>
I'm a slave<br/>
You a slave<br/>
You a slave<br/>
I'm a slave for this shit<br/>
I'm a slave<br/>
You a slave<br/>
I'm a slave<br/>
You got to slave for this shit<br/>
<br/>
Walk inside of Def Jam<br/>
Step on the president table and dap 'em up with the left hand<br/>
Cause I'm countin' money with the right<br/>
In a different city every night<br/>
And I'm sellin' records like it's white<br/>
It's another day, another flight<br/>
Paris in the morning, what elegant night<br/>
What a beautiful sight<br/>
Now tell me who be fuckin' with me, alright?<br/>
Everybody know I'm livin' this life<br/>
Everyone know that I got the baddest wife<br/>
This shit right here, everybody gonna like<br/>
Hold up, I know, I know what I like<br/>
Tell me why everybody in the pipe<br/>
Cause I'm the only one doin' it right<br/>
I'm a Rap Genius like Rob Markman<br/>
Spent a couple of million on my new apartment<br/>
Down in Manhattan, that's a multi-million dollar view<br/>
And I got it from rappin'<br/>
Damn near everyone nabbin' on the boy, heh, shit<br/>
I'm not a mad rapper, but what?<br/>
I'm angrier than Kanye<br/>
Angrier than Kanye when he talkin' about clothes<br/>
That's a fashion line<br/>
And my last album went number one<br/>
So what that mean?<br/>
I did better than you, you, you<br/>
Sold way more than that pop bitch<br/>
And I dare Def Jam to drop this<br/>
I just drop hits<br/>
Check the Instagram fam<br/>
I got fifty-thousand people in the crowd, singin' out loud<br/>
Every word, that's every lyric<br/>
You can hate, shit, just stop actin' like you don't hear it<br/>
This shit right here for the party<br/>
That album that comin', that's shit for the spirit, woo!<br/>
<br/>
