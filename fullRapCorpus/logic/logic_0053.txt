<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Life of a don<br/>
Top 5 Mc's you gotta rewind me<br/>
This what ya'll been waitin' for ain't it. <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Chilling with my team counting this fucking money<br/>
I stay with presidents like special agents honey<br/>
You get it from the bank<br/>
I get it from the mint<br/>
Only new bills call me the fresh prince<br/>
We gon' take over the whole world<br/>
Real all the time<br/>
Ratpack so thorough<br/>
Used to rock stones<br/>
And now my shorty wearin' pearls<br/>
Fuck with grown woomen no time for these lil' girls<br/>
I used to think about the things in which I never had<br/>
But now whenever I reflect it only makes me glad<br/>
I went from H.O.C. to chauffeurs in the HOV<br/>
But hustlin' tapes like they was keys<br/>
So much paparazzi catch an epileptic seiz'<br/>
I used to struggle with this shit now I kill it with ease<br/>
Started nation wide now I'm tourin over seas<br/>
Life of a don money blowing in the breeze<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
They say time is money and I spend most of that one rhymin'<br/>
I eat filet mingnon reminisce when this was ramen<br/>
Yeah yo chain shinin'?<br/>
But my aura is blindin'<br/>
I'm sick of us currency<br/>
I want millions and diamonds<br/>
Ya'll roll blunts, we roll cubans<br/>
Sound of my city so soothin'<br/>
Check my method man bring the suits in<br/>
Haters we leave em oozin'<br/>
Headed to the top penthouse where we movin ha!<br/>
Bless the mic with my presence and then I teach ya<br/>
Listen carefully as I beseech ya<br/>
If I never meet ya<br/>
I hope my lyrics reach ya<br/>
Some like they keys white homie I prefer Alicia<br/>
<br/>
