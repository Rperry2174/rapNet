<i>[Verse: Logic]</i><br/>
Baby you got me confused, with one of them other dudes<br/>
Under they breath mumblin', shout out to Spitta I'm crumblin'<br/>
All these haters that want it homie I keep it a hundred<br/>
Never fronted while you stunting acting like you hate it but really want it<br/>
I swear to God when they talkin' shit it just make me smile<br/>
Cause you ain't no hater my brotha' just a fan in denial<br/>
Every time that you hate on me I get stronger when risen<br/>
Judgin' these lyrics by my skin homie that's racism<br/>
My momma white my daddy black but ya'll don't even listen<br/>
Judgin' by only what you see that's (eye-tistic?) division<br/>
And (then the end?) creates an intellectual collision<br/>
But if you listen to my words then you would see my vision<br/>
But that's enough on that subject homie I'll make you flaunt<br/>
On the tour bus, four of us, the weed's gone<br/>
But I ain't smokin', I'm just writin' while homies tokin'<br/>
Playin' this game until that shit is broken<br/>
Fuckin' with honeys 'til they panties soakin'<br/>
Feelin' victorious, hella glorious, my story is gonna be depicted by<br/>
Me and my team that's <i>[?]</i> that did it big like Notorius<br/>
Haters talkin' shit gon' get the (goriest?) of <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Yo, that shit is whack yo;<br/>
Man what the- maaaaaan that shit was weak yo what the fuck was he talkin' about, errything he said made sense;<br/>
Maaaaan, that's some bullshit;<br/>
I mean- I mean you can't say much you know what I mean like yeah he spit you know what I'm sayin' like<br/>
His lyrics is good and- you know, he kill it- with the flow but, man that shit sucked though yuh)
