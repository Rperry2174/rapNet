<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted<br/>
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted<br/>
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki<br/>
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly<br/>
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go<br/>
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the model<br/>
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago<br/>
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die<br/>
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing<br/>
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh<br/>
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me<br/>
All that competition right there, are dead to me<br/>
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages<br/>
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous<br/>
Boy, I've been feeling courageous<br/>
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages<br/>
Feels like I'm running through mazes, everybody has they phases<br/>
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this<br/>
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it<br/>
One of the few that be killing it uh<br/>
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living<br/>
On the road to success you know that I'm driven<br/>
But they didn't wanna publish it, but right now I'm on some other shit<br/>
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl<br/>
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme<br/>
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills<br/>
And I never forget how that feels back when I went<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break 1:]</i><br/>
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone<br/>
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude<br/>
I look out of the window like goddamn, that's what I really do<br/>
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I was to sustain<br/>
If I look back on it I would do it all over again<br/>
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in<br/>
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again<br/>
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor<br/>
Crazy racist white bitch looking at us like "Who are these niggas?"<br/>
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash<br/>
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash<br/>
Now I'm riding on the train, All this shit inside my brain<br/>
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane<br/>
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam, oh my God this is my jam<br/>
May-December by Mos Def in my headphones, that's the man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break 2:]</i><br/>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own<br/>
He starts inside my mind, he fuckin' with me when I'm all alone<br/>
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?<br/>
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away<br/>
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am<br/>
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van<br/>
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala<br/>
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah<br/>
Up today the couple years, now my idols are my peers<br/>
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer<br/>
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this<br/>
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice<br/>
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive<br/>
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit - Logic &amp; Nikki:]</i><br/>
I can't believe you don't like Tarantino<br/>
Ugh, I don't like him because, like, when it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie<br/>
You mean like Inglorious Bastards?<br/>
I didn't see that<br/>
What?!<br/>
I didn't, I don't know<br/>
Oh my God, have you seen Pulp Fiction<br/>
Yeah, but I don't really remember it<br/>
What you talking about? Have you seen uh, this is funny cause we're on the train, have you seen, fuck! What's his name. The guy from the movie, in the place on the<br/>
On the train? With the scenery?<br/>
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit, Source Code<br/>
No<br/>
You haven't seen that?<br/>
No<br/>
With the dude from Donnie Darko<br/>
Who's that?<br/>
Oh my God<br/>
Well I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break 2:]</i><br/>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
And they wonder why I never get high<br/>
