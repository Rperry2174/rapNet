We get higher and higher<br/>
Crazy blue<br/>
Like St. Elmo's fire<br/>
Love's so sharp<br/>
And flat<br/>
That it's hard to know just where you're at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
From the back to the front door<br/>
Dealers on the Southside sellin on their front door<br/>
Little bit of weed, little bit of crack, whatever you need<br/>
While I'm sellin out shows in the ice cold<br/>
Shout out to the homies in the front row with the blunt rolled<br/>
That waited for hours in the snow just to see me flow<br/>
So you know I gotta stay after the show<br/>
'Cause if Chi-Town show love, I'm a show love<br/>
Outside, no gloves in the wintertime<br/>
'Cause I'm hungry like dinnertime<br/>
Stayin for every single one of my fans<br/>
Autographs 'til I couldn't feel my hands<br/>
Just a man with a plan, but you wouldn't understand<br/>
I get high by the notes, you get high by the gram<br/>
While you smoke to this<br/>
Reminisce when I wrote to this<br/>
Up-and-comers take note to this<br/>
We get it done on tour, waking up before the sundown<br/>
Lake Shore Drive shooting videos<br/>
On the block getting spotted by them city hoes (Hey!)<br/>
I know I never had to wonder if it's love or not<br/>
Shout-out to the homies up at Juggernaut<br/>
For keeping a motherfucker fresh, hell yes<br/>
No contest when it comes to gear in the city they be the best<br/>
Love my girls outgoing in my City, Chi<br/>
But it's MD 'til the day I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We get high<br/>
Oh so high<br/>
That my mind is in the sky<br/>
Shorties love it when I rub it<br/>
'Cause I never leave them dry<br/>
<br/>
We get high<br/>
Oh so high<br/>
That's what they say in the Chi<br/>
I get high<br/>
You get high<br/>
'Cause I'm the one that supplies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Shout-out to the Bobby Soxer girls that just love the flow<br/>
Chillin out late night with the weed lit blunt split and the paper rolled<br/>
RattPack smoking loudpack yeah they 'bout that<br/>
Haters talking shit yeah I never doubt that<br/>
With the GPS flow we re-route that<br/>
Road to riches we be 'bout that<br/>
Getting money like Oprah<br/>
Fryin' motherfuckers like Okra<br/>
Put your L up if you're a smoker<br/>
Full-time toker<br/>
Everything I got that's what I'm given no division 'til it's over<br/>
Sleeping on the Young Sinatra like a sedative<br/>
Now they on a brother's dick, so repetitive<br/>
And they wonder why (and they wonder why)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
