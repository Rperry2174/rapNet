He was a, class clown<br/>
Lover all around<br/>
He was kind of goofy<br/>
Make you feel good when you're down<br/>
But one day he disappeared and never came back<br/>
At 17 got kicked out by his mother just like that<br/>
He moved in with his father<br/>
That he never grew up with<br/>
But we're not gon' get into that like cocaine we gon' cut it<br/>
He loved music, but never had the time<br/>
Cause he was working two jobs and they both was overtime<br/>
His girlfriend always told him that he was destined to shine<br/>
He smiled, said "really?" but really paid it no mind<br/>
And when he was of age the situation was shitty<br/>
So he packed up all his stuff and then he moved across the city<br/>
Went to the room from his homie's mom and dad<br/>
They saw the situation and they felt so bad<br/>
They let him live with 'em, and he was doing good<br/>
Working at the street fixing cars under their hood<br/>
He got up with his mentor, that he knew for a while<br/>
He met him back when he was a youngin' only a child<br/>
A real good guy<br/>
That gave him some equipment<br/>
And then he sent him packing like a UPS shipment<br/>
He said "lay some tracks, and maybe we can get it"<br/>
So then he quit his job and he moved in with his sister<br/>
They lived together as children so yes he really missed her<br/>
But then he got another job, still working on music<br/>
Tryna find a style and figure out how to use it<br/>
But one day he got it<br/>
Yes he's so excited<br/>
But then he stopped<br/>
Said I got a way to go on top, they gon' find me<br/>
Such a long journey like I'm walking I-90<br/>
Three thousand miles leaving the haters behind me<br/>
Along his path, he ran into a wise man<br/>
Said "please tell me how I let 'em know I'm great"<br/>
Wise man then said "drop a mixtape<br/>
But not just a regular shit that everyone doin'<br/>
You gotta let'em know that you for real on what you're pursuing"<br/>
Then he was gone, just as quick as he came<br/>
After this encounter he would never be the same<br/>
'Bout 100 miles and runnin', he started feelin' something<br/>
What's that?<br/>
Maturity<br/>
Every single night, sacrifice rest to write<br/>
Dusk 'till dawn he be rapping 'till the sun up<br/>
Call him super Mario he always get the one up<br/>
Finally dropping tracks, now the mixtape is completed<br/>
His appetite for perfection was seriously needed<br/>
Then it dropped<br/>
He would, sell it for twenty but his country in recession so<br/>
Take it for ten homie consider it a blessing<br/>
Yes he a rookie, but you know they respect him<br/>
That Botox flow, so whenever he inject 'em<br/>
Them haters tighten up their game but now it don't affect him<br/>
'Cause if they step out of line yeah you know he finna check 'em<br/>
He grew up on the bottom, but dreamt about the top<br/>
He finally found out that until he reach it he won't stop<br/>
He's headed to the summit, where everybody plummet<br/>
The game need change and Logic can break a hunnit<br/>
The consul to the game so you know we run it<br/>
Nah, that last line was, over dramatic<br/>
But he coming for that ass and he gon' let 'em have it
