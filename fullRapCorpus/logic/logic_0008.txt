Psychological!<br/>
Damn right<br/>
Have you ever heard Psychological spit a verse son?<br/>
It's quite crazy<br/>
It's quite crazy son<br/>
Damn right!<br/>
<br/>
Some walk a vine line<br/>
I sip fine wine<br/>
Rhyme ahead of my time<br/>
A fetus with a wise mind<br/>
Now you know it's on<br/>
Hungry like Ramadan<br/>
And mothefuckers I ain't leaving 'til the plate's gone<br/>
I thought you knew<br/>
Lactose intolerant fool<br/>
Don't eat cheddar but my wallet do<br/>
This is how a scholar do<br/>
Phenomenal, I affect like domino<br/>
Rolling through like Geronimo<br/>
I'm hungry like a third world diet<br/>
80 sets a day send it my way<br/>
I'm viral, infectious<br/>
My state of mind is, bigger than Texas<br/>
I wrote this rhyme in my phone where the text is<br/>
Cause I ran out of paper if that they hungry I don't know what is<br/>
<br/>
Psychological, you know what that means y'all?<br/>
That means he is in your head for sure
