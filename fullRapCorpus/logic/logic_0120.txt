<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br/>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br/>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br/>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br/>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br/>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br/>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br/>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br/>
<br/>
Sellin' records on a major label<br/>
But I'm still movin' like I'm independent<br/>
Still respected like I'm independent<br/>
I'm just talkin' my shit so don't get offended<br/>
Bitch I been invented this real<br/>
Been the same since my deal<br/>
If you try to say that I'm changin'<br/>
Wait for the album, see how you feel<br/>
My third album, my Graduation like Kanye<br/>
Music on another level, yeah I'm tryna take this shit further beyond Ye<br/>
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise like I'm Beyoncé<br/>
Got a couple million in the bank right now<br/>
But I want my zeros beyond Jay<br/>
Counting money like Rothenberg, VC<br/>
Paid a price to be me<br/>
Ain't it nice to be me?<br/>
Ain't it nice to be free?<br/>
Do what you want when you wanna do it<br/>
On the real, it ain't nothin' to it<br/>
Young man on his Alan Watts<br/>
In a bookstore with my pocket watch<br/>
Wifey, goin' hard with the squats<br/>
Life good so they take shots<br/>
That's childish, I hate shots<br/>
I've been at it, Rattpack, get that shit tatted<br/>
Fuck with me on Snapchat<br/>
Talk shit and get clapped back<br/>
Only carry-on is my backpack<br/>
When I jetset like a war vet<br/>
What up<br/>
<br/>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br/>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br/>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br/>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br/>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br/>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br/>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br/>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br/>
<br/>
Everybody know I've been at it with this rap shit<br/>
Fuck around with this trap shit<br/>
But this next album is a wrap, shit<br/>
My third album, my Graduation like Kanye<br/>
Music on another level, yeah I'm tryna take this shit further beyond Ye<br/>
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise like I'm Beyoncé<br/>
Got a couple million in the bank right now<br/>
But I want my zeros beyond Jay<br/>
I want my zeros beyond<br/>
I want my zeros beyond Jay<br/>
That shit they talkin' beyond fake<br/>
Fact 'em right now he beyond fake<br/>
I'm a take a minute and get in it so you know I'm in it<br/>
This right here my house, you the tenant<br/>
Everything that happens, I intend it<br/>
Every word that you hear, I invented<br/>
I've been living like a king<br/>
I ain't worried 'bout a thing<br/>
I've just been bumpin' that<br/>
This why your girl on a sling<br/>
That's the type of shit I bring<br/>
I'm doin' this for the fans, so they can turn up in my absence<br/>
Started a channel, already made a hundred grand off of AdSense<br/>
I ain't do it for the money though<br/>
I don't do it for the money though<br/>
Shout out to Kid Cudi though<br/>
That's the homie, you already know<br/>
<br/>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br/>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br/>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br/>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br/>
What the fuck you mean you ain't know my name?<br/>
Only thing I changed, I ain't got no change<br/>
Still me and my homies and we all the same<br/>
Still me and my homies, screamin', "Fuck the fame"<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a damn, I know who I am, tell 'em<br/>
I don't give a damn, I know who I am<br/>
Yeah they talkin', but I'm gettin' money for me and my fam<br/>
This shit ain't that super deep<br/>
Nah this right here just the jam<br/>
This right here the jam<br/>
This right here just the jam<br/>
This shit right here jam<br/>
This my jam<br/>
This shit here the jam
