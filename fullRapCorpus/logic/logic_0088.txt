<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah, livin' life like this<br/>
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this<br/>
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this<br/>
Where they up to no good on a night like this<br/>
And they murder motherfuckers just cause<br/>
Type of shit I see and probably wonder what it was<br/>
I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug<br/>
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug<br/>
Now, born and raised in my area<br/>
Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria<br/>
Fuck around and bury ya tonight<br/>
Ridin' with my homies on sight<br/>
Momma tell me to come in at night<br/>
Now I really gotta go, but they never know<br/>
Living life to the fullest, I got to blow<br/>
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib<br/>
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib<br/>
God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night<br/>
Waking up, scared for my life<br/>
Never had the heat, just a knife<br/>
When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that<br/>
Guarantee you it’s a wrap, finna put you on your back<br/>
Like that<br/>
Just breathe, while their mama grieve<br/>
Bullet to the dome like an aleve<br/>
Got to leave from the premises, to murder my nemesis<br/>
No, no, uh, uh<br/>
Just stop, stop, stop<br/>
‘fore they even call the cops<br/>
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props<br/>
Tell me why another body even got to drop<br/>
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related<br/>
<br/>
<i>[News Reporter:]</i><br/>
"Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this<br/>
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this<br/>
All about the money on a night like this<br/>
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib<br/>
Got a lot to give but I never had the chance<br/>
Never had the chance, yeah<br/>
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out<br/>
If you want it Imma lay it out<br/>
Hope my little brother make it out<br/>
Every night what I pray about<br/>
What I pray about, check it uh yeah<br/>
Got a son on the way<br/>
But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away<br/>
I imagine a better life<br/>
Where I never had a debt in life<br/>
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night<br/>
Selling crack to my own pops<br/>
Pushing this weight on my own block<br/>
If I sell a brick I can buy a house<br/>
If they find a key they might lock me up<br/>
But I take the chance cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<br/>
Take the chance cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Get down and lay down<br/>
Hit you with the Beretta and you better stay down<br/>
Straight shots on the playground<br/>
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given<br/>
Anybody that’s riding with me, I’m riding with them<br/>
Show me the enemy and Imma hit em<br/>
The second I bit em I get em and hit em with the venom<br/>
Ain’t no need to pretend Imma never do it<br/>
I knew it, all ready been through it<br/>
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life<br/>
Anybody that's gang related
