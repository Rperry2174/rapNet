<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Yea<br/>
Bitches be pressed for paper<br/>
Chillin' with my homie sledro while he ignites the vapor<br/>
Life is a bitch and you cannot escape her<br/>
Unless you talking suicide<br/>
What the fuck you mean that I'm changin'?<br/>
Cause I finally gotta little bit of money and a range in my drive way<br/>
With a rattpack smoking on zimbabwe<br/>
Crankin' Sinatra that my way<br/>
Bitches they love it<br/>
Visionary nothin' above it<br/>
Get shorties wet when I rub it<br/>
Carbon copies they dub it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
You used to hate it<br/>
Now you love it<br/>
Smile in my face?<br/>
I think nothin' of it<br/>
Yea I'll shake your hand<br/>
Kill em' with kindness<br/>
Homie this is young Sinatra at his fuckin' finest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Yea<br/>
This is for my independent women that is runnin' shit in high heels<br/>
Educated in business but majored in sex appeal<br/>
My shorty she gotta<br/>
Sportin' gucci louie and Prada<br/>
Looking beautiful in it all but I prefer nada<br/>
Yea, low maintenance and high scale<br/>
Type of shorty that when you get locked up she pay the bail<br/>
I used to follow my dreams until I caught up to em'<br/>
People talking shit but pay attention to what we doin'<br/>
It's never been done<br/>
Watch me go platinum just for fun<br/>
Far from materialistic but let me stunt son<br/>
You know what I be on, you know where I be at<br/>
The proof is within the numbers they slumber but now they react<br/>
I got 3 tapes, 0 tolerance one of the greats<br/>
Put that shit together and what you get that's where I'm from<br/>
The 301, smoking joints with your girl for fun<br/>
Stand strong and never run unless the po go for the gun like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Logic]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
We snatch it like interception<br/>
Met the girl of my dreams, her love resembled inception<br/>
Her sign was a leo<br/>
Me, her, and music that's the perfect trio<br/>
Spanish hunny we met in rio, future lookin cleo<br/>
Bitches be braggin<br/>
So much money my pants saggin<br/>
VMG is up-to-date but these businessmen be lackin'<br/>
Eve bit the apple, steve changed the world<br/>
Getting money like zuckerburg, my bank account is sterol<br/>
I am not defined by that in which I do possess<br/>
Cause all it takes is riches to get bitches to undress<br/>
I need drive in a lady, not a girl that drive me crazy<br/>
Need a girl that don't care if a drive a honda or mercedes<br/>
Spit fire like hades, I infect it like rabies<br/>
It's all that, shout out to them 90's babies<br/>
Never hesitate to supply the heat<br/>
What 6ix produces from his chest, we call that shit a heartbeat<br/>
I'm a king, you fuckas my pawns<br/>
Shortcut to the desktop, I am your newest icon<br/>
These bitches they love it, I truly can't stress it enough<br/>
Girl got them daddy problems that's why she be actin tough<br/>
Innocent in person, but in the bed she love it rough<br/>
Running away from reality to sniff coke and puff<br/>
So, let me get it the second I spit it you know that I did it all the people wanna come around<br/>
They used to hate it, but now they love the sound<br/>
<br/>
