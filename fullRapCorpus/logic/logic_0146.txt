It feel like just yesterday I was broke as hell<br/>
Livin life behind these bars like I couldn’t make the bail, shit<br/>
Workin at wings, start cookin chicken that was boneless<br/>
Til my sister kick me out before Christmas and I was homeless<br/>
Girl I ain’t mad at ya you know I love you the same<br/>
Cause all I did was light the fire to break up in this game<br/>
I had a girl for a while, she was the love of my life<br/>
Thought we’d have a couple kids, she’d be my lover, my wife<br/>
Til she felt it wasn’t working so I asked what was next<br/>
She said nothing and left me with that goodbye sex<br/>
That was 2010 felt like I would die then<br/>
Til I packed up the mics and fuck it all and fully dived in<br/>
Fast forward a couple years my flow is fully infectious<br/>
Up in your system like Tetanus, close to your heart like a necklace<br/>
In private events, Kevin Liles and John Gotti<br/>
Trey Songz and even Trey’s mom what a party<br/>
This the life that I’m livin, can’t forget where I came<br/>
Maryland just like Monroe man all of y’all know the name<br/>
It’s been a long time comin, and this music all I got<br/>
And even though I knew I’d always make it still who woulda thought<br/>
Def Jam, goddamn, but you know we keep it visionary<br/>
V’s up, til we on top like missionary<br/>
Conversations while the Empire State in the backdrop<br/>
Spittin bars with Nas on the Manhattan rooftop<br/>
Talkin business and predicting what quarter the tape will drop<br/>
15, writing rhymes, inspired by Illmatic<br/>
I’m still at it, every record I record leave the record shattered<br/>
Cause I’ll be in the lab for a month<br/>
Searchin for inner peace through meditation like a monk<br/>
I’ll be, makin that music, makin, makin that music that<br/>
Resonates from the birds to the hood<br/>
I remember wishin Yeezy would sign me to GOOD<br/>
But now we on the same label so the shit’s all good<br/>
And to be honest I’m glad that I did it myself<br/>
Cause I know what’s in store like I stock the shelf<br/>
All the hip hop fans, they gotta wait through the commercial<br/>
But they know the feature presentation gon be universal<br/>
That rehearsal thinkin bout my life<br/>
And how you know I refuse to be blinded by the light<br/>
And everything is all right<br/>
RattPack, Visionary all day it’s Logic<br/>
I’ll be spittin this never written ridiculous goddamn off the top of the dome<br/>
I’m murderin every single one of they chromosomes<br/>
I’m reppin Maryland to the fullest, push us but never pull us you know the deal<br/>
This is how we do it all the time, we keep it real<br/>
It’s that RattPack, hit you with a gat, crack crack<br/>
Like that never slack goddamn now can you feel it<br/>
Can I ride wit ya, paint this picture like I got it so ridiculous<br/>
I got it like that, ain’t no need for grippin the gat<br/>
Keep it ratt, never slack, motivation attack<br/>
Goddamn I could feel it this is strictly off the top<br/>
It’s never written cause that shit is forbidden<br/>
I’m never kiddin like the miss that’s on that birth control<br/>
Goddamn, the second that I feel the vibe<br/>
And yes I’m fuckin up so that’s how you know that this shit is so goddamn real<br/>
Tell me how you feel, how you feel, never squealed like that<br/>
Blat, hit you with a gat, sike nah<br/>
NYC to MD the L-O-G-I-C I’m reppin in<br/>
Yes I gotta get it, second that we steppin in<br/>
It’s strictly off the top<br/>
I could feel the energy, I ain’t talkin E-N-E-R-G-Y<br/>
I mean inner G, that’s the shit they never see<br/>
But I’ll hold supremacy, number one I bet I’ll be<br/>
Bitch I said I better be<br/>
Tryin to take my kindness for weakness<br/>
Get the better of me, fuck that<br/>
Never stop with that<br/>
This is how we doin, pack it back then I hit that<br/>
Ridiculous, understand it’s ridicule’less<br/>
You can never top this, you can never stop this<br/>
Hundred thousand first week, album when I drop this<br/>
Goddamn can you feel it that’s the man<br/>
Said it’s Logic
