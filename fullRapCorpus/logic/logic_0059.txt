Aye girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Aye girl<br/>
It's obvious you fine<br/>
I just want to know what's deep inside your mind<br/>
Maybe we can play girl<br/>
I hope you ain't got no man<br/>
If you do I understand<br/>
But I'm tryna make plans<br/>
That body one of a kind<br/>
I'd be lyin<br/>
If I said I wasn't tryna make you mine<br/>
I can give you my number you can give me what ever we'll have a hell of a time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
What up baby girl won't you come here<br/>
I put it on my life I seen you some where<br/>
Where you stay at I'll come there ha<br/>
Ain't no stalking shit<br/>
I just want to talk and shit<br/>
Maybe grab a bite then after walk a bit<br/>
I just want to converse<br/>
Come on baby ain't no need to disperse<br/>
Shorty got that type of beauty that inspire this verse<br/>
So what's up<br/>
I'd be lyin if I said I didn't want a cup but it's deeper then that getting knee deep in the cat<br/>
I'm looking for that ride or die type of women it's what ever<br/>
I can be your king you can be my correta<br/>
Ain't no better<br/>
Get you wetter<br/>
Fuck em all<br/>
Think outside the box baby girl you know I ball<br/>
Yes you know I want it all<br/>
So make that shit a double<br/>
This is Young Sinatra and I'm rising from the rubble<br/>
People never say what's on there mind I'm like fuck a muzzle<br/>
Cause I got the feeling your the missing piece to my puzzle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Aye girl<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
What ever she wants I let her pick it like a fence from the suburbs everything coach but her plane ticket yea heard<br/>
We real all the time that's my word<br/>
Catch me in the cut tryna book her like a nerd<br/>
She a red bone bobby soxer<br/>
I had to stop her ha<br/>
Shorty a dime so you know I'm tryna cop her<br/>
Pop a bottle at our table periodically<br/>
Now check the science of that last line do it logically<br/>
No stopin me<br/>
I bet she would've never guest I never<br/>
Graduated<br/>
Cause the way I put my words together she infatuated<br/>
Mama I don't want know drama and I'm serious<br/>
Pause like a coma for I end it like a period now<br/>
Girl don't treat me like your ex man<br/>
I'm a beast on the track but if I am your next man<br/>
I'm a treat you tender<br/>
Take it slow like one video render<br/>
I remember<br/>
When I seen you for the first time<br/>
It was special like when I wrote my first rhyme<br/>
So if all I do is grind and never sleep<br/>
Then how in the hell is me and the girl of my dreams supposed to meet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Aye girl<br/>
It's obvious you fine<br/>
I just want to know what's deep inside your mind<br/>
Maybe we can play girl<br/>
I hope you ain't got no man<br/>
If you do I understand<br/>
But I'm tryna make plans<br/>
That body one of a kind<br/>
I'd be lyin<br/>
If I said I wasn't tryna make you mine<br/>
I can give you my number you can give me what ever we'll have a hell of a time
