I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins<br/>
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain<br/>
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you<br/>
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you<br/>
Maybe I'm not as strong as I once was<br/>
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz<br/>
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs<br/>
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go<br/>
Cause in the end what happens you already know<br/>
Probably wonder where I been at I been laying low<br/>
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for<br/>
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that<br/>
You the only girl I need I gotta have you back<br/>
Even though you turn my lungs black<br/>
Tell me where you've been jack<br/>
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary<br/>
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing<br/>
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy<br/>
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me<br/>
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first<br/>
Me and you together swear to god I saw that work<br/>
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work<br/>
Uh, my heart is hard at work<br/>
We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man<br/>
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go<br/>
What will they write upon my grave<br/>
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave<br/>
But everything he gave her was for nothing though<br/>
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go<br/>
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas<br/>
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous<br/>
All I know is I'm living the life I never would<br/>
Finally let you go I thought I never could<br/>
Don't get me wrong can't forget the times shared<br/>
Seem like everywhere I go I always know you there<br/>
Tried to run but my legs won't<br/>
I look away but my head don't<br/>
I love it when you're fresh<br/>
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath<br/>
I hate it that I need you, Nikki<br/>
But I love it when I feed you Nikki<br/>
I hate that I bleed for you<br/>
Uh, I long and I need for you<br/>
But I love it when I taste you<br/>
Nothing can replace you<br/>
I wish I could erase you, you're everywhere I go<br/>
But you're everywhere I long to be<br/>
And all these other people that don't seem to understand<br/>
I'm just a man they always ask what's wrong with me<br/>
Man you're everything I crave<br/>
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in a grave<br/>
I'm a king, you're my Coretta<br/>
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine<br/>
<br/>
Slave for the<br/>
Said I'm a slave for the nicotine<br/>
Been a slave for ya<br/>
I'm a muthafuckin slave for ya<br/>
Slave for the nicotine<br/>
Nikki, Nikki slave for ya<br/>
I'm a slave for ya Nikki<br/>
I'm a muthafuckin slave for ya<br/>
<br/>
