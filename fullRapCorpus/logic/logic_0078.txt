<i>[Verse 1 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Okay it's RattPack til my pulse flat<br/>
We keep it real, no false rap<br/>
I got 4 cars and they all black<br/>
Got 4 broads and they all that<br/>
(What) we call that?<br/>
Balling, doing this since my calling<br/>
Flow is so appalling<br/>
My phone off and she calling, I'm like<br/>
"Yeah, what it do?", Penthouse man what a view<br/>
Fall back because I'm coming through with my whole team they coming too<br/>
That's real, too real<br/>
Motherfucker tell me how you feel<br/>
I'm too good for my own good, I won't leak the album I'll let it spill<br/>
Number 1 bitch I bet it will, do the numbers I said it will<br/>
I play the game and I'm still the same and I'll never change<br/>
Just to get a deal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin',<br/>
I came from nothing to something like it's nothing<br/>
Yeah you know I done it now there's no discussion<br/>
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin',<br/>
I made a promise to my mama I'mma turn these zeros into tons of commas<br/>
Bitch I'm ballin', ballin',<br/>
Closing million dollar deals catch me swervin', burning 100 dollar bills<br/>
How it feel when you<br/>
Ballin', ballin', going places they never go<br/>
It ain't all about the money but I stack it cause you never know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Logic:]</i><br/>
I'mma live life 'til I overdose<br/>
While they sleeping on me, that's comatose<br/>
I went mainstream with my main team you just mad as fuck you ain't come close<br/>
And yo next girl is my ex girl she fine as hell but she a mess girl<br/>
All I do is rhyme I got no time so I can't reply to yo text girl<br/>
Bitch I'm back again and I run it<br/>
Always gotta keep it one hundred<br/>
All of y'all know y'all want it<br/>
Turn it up and get blunted<br/>
I'm like fuck the money, fuck the fame<br/>
I came here to fuck up the game<br/>
Gon' get it... I'm feeling myself<br/>
Fresh to death, bitch I'm killing myself<br/>
I'm gone<br/>
We burning it up, step in the building we turning it up<br/>
Talking that shit but they never end it, when I step to the mic I be murdering it<br/>
And we living real good,<br/>
Mainstream but it's still good<br/>
I got raw shit, I got real shit but right now it's time for that feel good<br/>
What we call that?<br/>
Balling, doing this since my calling<br/>
Flow is so appalling<br/>
My phone off and she calling, I'm like<br/>
"Yeah, what it do?",<br/>
Penthouse man what a view<br/>
Fall back because I'm coming through with my whole team they coming too<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - C Dot Castro:]</i><br/>
Yeah, you know that we ballin' we be going all in hold on<br/>
Let me slow it down so y'all get the shit<br/>
These haters talk but I don't give a shit<br/>
Got models, bottles and the piff is lit<br/>
But we balling, kinda like Spauldin and Rawling<br/>
On the road to riches never Stalling<br/>
Got yo girl all up all on my nuts<br/>
But she do it with joy, no almonds, ugh<br/>
Living life to perfection<br/>
VIP that's the section<br/>
Presidential watch, presidential suites<br/>
You would think we held an election<br/>
It go Logic first then I'm up next<br/>
I do not converse I just cut checks<br/>
I do not rehearse I just drop the verse<br/>
I need to cop a hearse cause I'm fresh to death<br/>
I bet you never seen so much designer<br/>
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer<br/>
Boy I stunt but I ain't even tryna<br/>
Swagging is nice but first I'm a rhymer<br/>
And I rep Maryland home of the Terrapins<br/>
Say you spit crack homie we spit that heroin<br/>
Bring it right to your front door like I'm caroling<br/>
Standing next to me would be so embarrassin' yeah we be ballin'!<br/>
<br/>
