<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
And to immediately start our show<br/>
I want to bring out the host of tonight's show<br/>
You all know him<br/>
A very wonderful, wonderful personality of show business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Now ain't it funny how the whole thing changed<br/>
They said I'd never make it, now their words rearranged<br/>
I went from nothing to something<br/>
But I was something all along<br/>
Who you know on the come-up doing numbers in Hong Kong<br/>
Got fans in LA, got fans in NY<br/>
Got fans down in Atlanta and all the way to the Chi<br/>
We world wide (world wide)<br/>
World wide motherfucker<br/>
They think we pay for promotions but our strength is in numbers<br/>
This is so comical, so hilarious<br/>
All these stupid groupie bitches want to marry us<br/>
And just a year ago I had to pay to perform<br/>
And now venues across the country dropping stacks to go on<br/>
I've been working for years and sometimes I get heated<br/>
But those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it<br/>
I do it for the fans<br/>
They know what the message is<br/>
Rattpack is world wide, don't believe it check the messages<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
And now I'm back but I'm a switch the style up<br/>
We moving at high speed, these fuckers are dialed up<br/>
You know I formulate my words like a dissertation<br/>
So let a brother proceed like litigation<br/>
I know you feel this deep inside of you, no penetration<br/>
We got something for everybody but in my duration<br/>
You gotta crawl before you walk<br/>
I ball but you blog<br/>
Share knowledge like it's stocks<br/>
Since they <i>[?]</i> the apart<br/>
Back in the days and the 9 millimeter strays that grazed<br/>
My old apartment<br/>
To wherever I dreamed that's where my heart went<br/>
Now, as a baby my Mama was on the bottle<br/>
Couldn't wait 'till I was of the age to hit the loto<br/>
Or the throtto and I'm gone<br/>
Like fuck the world<br/>
All I had was music and my girl<br/>
'Till that shit fell apart and this life Averelled<br/>
Never the less, I atest and "Am I blessed? " Hell yes<br/>
Occasional stress, but I only bite what I can digest<br/>
Back in the day it was jeans and white tee's<br/>
Now that I got all the sponsors I can keep up with the companies<br/>
Now I'm not bragging about material possessions<br/>
I'm trying to teach you a lesson about business and progression<br/>
And what happens when you perfect the image in your profession<br/>
Ain't no second guessing, you know it's all about perception<br/>
I used to talk about the things I wasn't really doing<br/>
But I had to visualize it before I started pursuing it<br/>
Yeah, huh, and now a motherfucker doing it<br/>
But business aside, it's been a beautiful ride<br/>
Cause I do it for the fans and brush the haters aside<br/>
I can't wait for the day when I look through the eyes of my bride<br/>
Cause every lion needs it's queen and make it's children is pride<br/>
But these haters really don't know what the message is (don't know what the message is)<br/>
Once again, "Don't believe it? " check the messages<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Outro: Logic]</i><br/>
I just want to take a moment, a moment of your time right now<br/>
I just want to thank everybody<br/>
I'm nothing without my fans<br/>
I'm nothing without my team<br/>
It's been a long journey<br/>
And this is just the beginning<br/>
Thank you all so much<br/>
I truly, I truly love you all from the bottom of my heart<br/>
Man this shit is crazy<br/>
Since day 1, I been at it<br/>
I know I probably sound real, real tired<br/>
But, shit the whole Rattpack been up for the like past 4 days trying to finish up this mixtape<br/>
It's just been crazy<br/>
But you already know what it is<br/>
Logic, Young Sinatra<br/>
Shout out to the Bobby Soxers, Rattpack all day, Visionary<br/>
I love ya'll<br/>
(Sinatra)
