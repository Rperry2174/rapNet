Yeah it's Logic on the beat so I'm fresh to the T<br/>
Got lines like a cokehead, repping MD<br/>
On stage where I'm living<br/>
In the booth where I'm driven<br/>
Yeah the flow's so wet that I keep a bitch drippin'<br/>
Hand me the mic and I guarantee I'mma be rippin' it<br/>
Automatic static yes I keep the extra clipping it<br/>
A small town boy with a big city swag on<br/>
My CSI tip, tap a bitch and then I bag her<br/>
<br/>
It's logic on the beat so I'm fresh to the T<br/>
Got lines like a cokehead, repping MD<br/>
Said it's logic on the beat so I'm fresh to the T<br/>
Got lines like a cokehead, repping MD<br/>
<br/>
Cheese like Gary dough like Pillsbury<br/>
When I'm tryna get so much style, yes very<br/>
Got something for the club<br/>
Got something for the street<br/>
Got something for them hungry MCs tryna eat<br/>
Jumping on the track and you know the mic I'mma slaughter<br/>
I'm the type of guy that you don't want around your daughter<br/>
All 9s and dimes I get 'em all the time<br/>
Flying coach with Louis V and we sipping fine wine<br/>
Gucci women, dimes I swim in<br/>
36C Vicky sees yeah she's feeling<br/>
<br/>
It's logic on the beat so I'm fresh to the T<br/>
Got lines like a cokehead, repping MD<br/>
Said it's logic on the beat so I'm fresh to the T<br/>
Got lines like a cokehead, repping MD<br/>
<br/>
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pick it all up<br/>
Stack up your funds like a million bucks<br/>
Across the pond, they all know us<br/>
International...whoaaaa!<br/>
Driving my car to a foreign place<br/>
Lookin' at me, now they know my face<br/>
We want it all now, we got it all yes<br/>
Look at that...<br/>
<br/>
Thought I was gone, homie I'm right back<br/>
I'll be chilling where I'm chilling and be clowning where I'm at<br/>
Such a, lazy boy, psycho get crazy boy<br/>
I'm a freshman in the game they wanna, haze me boy<br/>
Never (looking at, looking at, looking at me)<br/>
Just a fly young brother staying repping MD<br/>
(Looking at, looking at, looking at me)<br/>
Steady getting green I ain't talking 'bout the trees<br/>
Jump on the track, homie you ain't seeing me<br/>
License to kill, registered at the D.M.V<br/>
Just got the title most underrated MC<br/>
But it's aight this ain't the last you finna hear from me<br/>
Just the beginning I'm Michael Phelps when he's swimming<br/>
I'm the rookie Barry Bonds in the very first inning<br/>
In other words, homie I'm steady chillin'<br/>
But all these other MCs form and they grillin'<br/>
Most people drop tracks but me I spill 'em<br/>
Stain in the game try to scrub me I will still in<br/>
Yes you know I get it like a bad bitch I hit it<br/>
Middle finger to the critics cause I'm sick just admit it<br/>
Charge me as a wack rapper but I was acquitted<br/>
Judge me on my skin color but my father is a brother<br/>
Finally heard the flow and now you know I'm unlike any other<br/>
<br/>
"Get 'em all, get 'em all, pick it all up<br/>
Stack up your funds like a million bucks"
