<i>[Hook: Logic]</i><br/>
Take some time, do it slow, tell me what you want<br/>
It's about that time, girl you know it<br/>
Tell me what you want<br/>
I know you are my girl, tell me what you want<br/>
Why act like you don't want it girl, tell me what you want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Logic]</i><br/>
Baby girl when it comes to women I've been around the block a couple of times<br/>
But you're the only shorty that's running circles in my mind<br/>
And in this day and age that we live in, and it's all defined<br/>
Why you so intellectual? Why you so damn fine, now<br/>
Hey girl, hey girl yeah I'm trying to get it<br/>
Stop it with all of these games and tell me whattup with it<br/>
Just take my hand, I'll be your man<br/>
We surrounded by infidelity in this world that we live in<br/>
But I promise I never give in, that's a given<br/>
I'm living for you and another<br/>
Just a brother trying to find a lover to cherish until he perish<br/>
With honeymoons on the stars and vacations in Paris<br/>
Don't be embarrassed if you get addicted to these kinda things<br/>
It's the finer things, fuck the haters and what the drama brings<br/>
It ain't nada, I supply the Prada and diamond rings just as long as your heart sings, so<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Logic]</i><br/>
Uh yeah<br/>
And now we back at, shorty pussy like a drug, and she got me cornered like a crack addict<br/>
Got my mind racing, eradict<br/>
Better yet it's erotic<br/>
You want it I got it<br/>
Look at what you started, way she work it when she on top I might as well applaud it<br/>
Lord have mercy I'm trying to get it<br/>
Rip it and split it, hell yeah you know I did it<br/>
Converse then lay you down like a verse, I'm trying to hit it<br/>
Baby I want it, always down to keep it a hunnit<br/>
With you my feet are never on the ground, the way I'm a plummet<br/>
Headed to the summit, so tell me are you really 'bout it<br/>
I never doubt it, you're the one that I need<br/>
Apart from you my emotions begin to recede<br/>
You are everything that I have wanted and all that I need<br/>
So shorty tell me how you feelin', worth feelin', looks killin'<br/>
I need it. I'm not tryna beat it and delete it<br/>
I'm trying to build and let you know that everything we sharing is real<br/>
<br/>
