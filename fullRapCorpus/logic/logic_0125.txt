Chattering<br/>
<br/>
Feel it when I murder, so much further<br/>
I could go and so I look up to the sky<br/>
Oh my, oh my<br/>
Oh my, oh my<br/>
Oh my, oh my<br/>
Oh my, oh my<br/>
Oh my, oh my<br/>
Oh my, oh my<br/>
I say oh my<br/>
<br/>
I feel the Arian in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood<br/>
Been looking for holy water now I'm prayin' for a flood<br/>
Feel like time passing me by, slower than a slug<br/>
While this feelin' inside of my body's feelin' like a rug<br/>
You can hug me, rub me on the back like a child<br/>
Tell me you love me, need me, promise me you'll never leave me<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute, is that-?<br/>
Ayy, who's all in there? You playin' that?<br/>
6ix you can't be playin' that, that's the album shit, dawg!
