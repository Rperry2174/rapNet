Meanwhile, back at the rapcave!<br/>
Jumping Gee willickers rapman you're never gonna believe it!<br/>
What seems to be the problem my raptastic companion?<br/>
I just found out there's a bunch of wack ass, no talent having, swear they can<br/>
Rap, 40-something, shoulda got a job, still living with their parents, so wack they<br/>
Couldn't even get the whole 15 minutes of fame, only got 2 minutes perpetrating bitch ass<br/>
Motherfuckers out there on the scene trying to make music!<br/>
Oh my god! (I know!)<br/>
Rapman will not stand for this! (Go Get 'Em!)<br/>
To the booth!<br/>
<br/>
Now let me hop up in the rap mobile, get so much pussy in the back they should call it the cat-mobile<br/>
Everybody's worried about a deal, but I keep it real<br/>
Fucking around and I hit you in the crown with a inevitable sound that's spreading through your town<br/>
Hold up! Gee willickers rapman I don't think they comprehend or can begin to even understand<br/>
We don't fight crime, we fight whack rhymes, one song at a time, line after line<br/>
Hold up! Motherfucker I'm bout to roll up, pull out the hamma on a bamma leave em tore up (oh my god!)<br/>
Yea you talk, but can you walk, lets see you put the dough up (Cha-Ching!)<br/>
Rhymes I throw up, a little nasty bastard, people hating on a brother just cause I mastered the flow<br/>
Like Jedi, bet I, murder it before you heard of it, bitches I'm murking it<br/>
Go berzerk in the club while honeys twerkin it<br/>
Haters talking shit where they ain't no time for this, you know I'm bombing this, the flow is ominous<br/>
Second I'm rhyming this, sound like a dominous (Ching!)<br/>
All the people that was hatin' in the beginning, know that I'm winning, let me slip through your fingers<br/>
And now your spinning, you can check the Polaroid pictures cuz bitches I'm grinning I got it<br/>
Treat the game like a honey, I had to get inside it<br/>
Visionary of logic, is like two planets collided<br/>
I'm a lyrical miracle, matter fact a paradox<br/>
On stage while my DJ scratching like chicken pox<br/>
Never put me in your box, if your shit eats tapes<br/>
I'm not biting, only quoting one of the greats, now<br/>
The radio got me feeling disgusted, punch you in the snotbox til your brain concussed it<br/>
Women they lust it, when they guts get busted, rip it up and thrust it I'm the best trust it<br/>
<br/>
OH MY GOD! Rapman What have you done!?<br/>
Why, whatever do you mean rapboy?<br/>
Not only did you kill all the whack rappers, but my favorite ones as well what were you thinking!<br/>
Well I just had to show these motherfuckers who's in charge<br/>
What by obliterating them?<br/>
Well how else was I supposed to let them know who's really running shit around here<br/>
No, no, you're out of control, your drunk with power!<br/>
<br/>
Yo, let me get it, you know that I did it, my flow is outta this world, like the alien that spit acidic<br/>
Middle finger to the critics and as fresh as a fitted, soon as a bet, get the honeys wet never upset<br/>
When I catch wreck, like Bobba Fett down to collect, doesn't even register that I ain't taken a breath yet?<br/>
Oh my God! Oh My God! West Deer Park done raised the rap God<br/>
Maryland I'm reppin it, dare ya to step in it<br/>
None others iller for realer the killer slash drug dealer<br/>
I get bitches erotic by slinging dick like a narcotic, you want it I brought it, hit the club and get the<br/>
Party started, yea<br/>
The flows never ending, always ascending, while apprehending anybody who's partially comprehending<br/>
Feeling limitless, quickly swallow the pill and enhance<br/>
With the killer stance, swallow the mic like a neverland<br/>
All up in yo bitche's pants, the second we dance I advance, at first glance go together like lettuce and ranch<br/>
A born winner, schooling MC's like Principal Skinner<br/>
How I murder a kill-able syllable's are no beginner<br/>
Feeling high style running through your stomach like hot bowel<br/>
I'm the only human being'll perfectly rap this<br/>
So I'm coming for ya head like john the baptist is this<br/>
This is the rapture, no camera can capture<br/>
Annihilating anybody that's violating by hating<br/>
I spit hotter than Satan, when he was migrating from heaven to hell<br/>
Step to the mic and I shall prevail<br/>
Finna blow your whole mind soon as time avail, what
