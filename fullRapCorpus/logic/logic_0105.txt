<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
What up Bobby<br/>
This that 95 shit right here<br/>
Take 'em back to the 90s!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice<br/>
It’s me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cooking like chemists<br/>
Take them back to way back when like Dennis, The Menace<br/>
Causing mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice<br/>
Smoking weed and getting higher then a flight attendant<br/>
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant<br/>
Got to pull it out for everyone that’s in attendance<br/>
Okay, back in the day as a college park tenant<br/>
Still can’t believe I didn’t get a shorty pregnant<br/>
Man. that’s the definition of a life sentence<br/>
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce<br/>
Cause I couldn’t keep it in my briefs, man that’s pathetic<br/>
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain’t a game of tennis<br/>
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate<br/>
Scared to go outside but I know I can’t prevent it<br/>
I'm, forever alone in my mind<br/>
See I’m a self diagnosed hypochondriac<br/>
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at<br/>
Yeah, I know that I’m livin' like I got it okay, yeah<br/>
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Lenbo:]</i><br/>
Ayo, fuck all that, it’s the fat young Jesus<br/>
Flow prestigious<br/>
Stackin’ money and playing the field man like Regis<br/>
Better believe us or leave us<br/>
Grabbin' your bitches’ cleavage like, oo-ah<br/>
I went from surveying to Super Saiyan slayin’ the man<br/>
Bitches want an autograph, I sign them titties in crayon<br/>
Like goddamn<br/>
It's me and B-I-G-L-N-B-O cooking like chemists<br/>
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie<br/>
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie<br/>
I'm unscannable, young cannibal<br/>
Eat wack MCs like Hannibal<br/>
Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
Over here, over here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic + Big Lenbo:]</i><br/>
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious<br/>
The young Spiegle, interstellar with my retrieval<br/>
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval<br/>
I spit at it like a Baretta, you know I get better by givin' the people<br/>
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'<br/>
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden<br/>
The Return of the Jedi, bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye<br/>
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do<br/>
This shit is overduePass me the fifth and I'm comin' through<br/>
The B-I-G-L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio<br/>
Aye dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo<br/>
To hold a brother down like the white man<br/>
Fuck that, nigga<br/>
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff<br/>
Even in a pair of cuffs know we always keep it real<br/>
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man<br/>
I'm just 301 reppin', second I step in Maryland<br/>
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon<br/>
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love<br/>
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this<br/>
Throw a Molotov in your crib and tell them bitches to bill us<br/>
We the illest<br/>
Finger fuck a critic, shit is darker than The Chronicles of Riddick<br/>
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it<br/>
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom<br/>
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on
