<i>[Verse 1 - Logic:]</i><br/>
I hope you feel this shit<br/>
Top ten flow and it's still this shit<br/>
Went away, had to get away<br/>
Been away, came back and a motherfucker still the shit<br/>
Hold up, what's real as this?<br/>
Feelin' myself, who ill as this?<br/>
Mastered the flow from the east to the west<br/>
But right now I'm wondering how trill is this<br/>
I've been around for a minute now<br/>
One hunnid, I'm in it now<br/>
People that wasn't there back in the day talkin' bout<br/>
Man, remember I'm winning now<br/>
I could only imagine if I was beginning now<br/>
Back in the beginning now<br/>
Fuck that<br/>
Spent a mil on the chain and I tell my company to duck that<br/>
Get the fuck back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Big KRIT:]</i><br/>
First off I give a fuck about all that top five if I ain't in it<br/>
Niggas barely ever play my records<br/>
But I'm still winnin' from the M-I-crooked<br/>
Just to make 'em peep what I'm cookin', I love Mississippi<br/>
I put a studio in my partner kitchen<br/>
So by the way I'm whippin you would think I'm juggin these hoes<br/>
Cuttin' crack and make 'em double back like excuse me nigga<br/>
I need a stove, nah, I ain't selling dope<br/>
But this a metaphor for my flow<br/>
But I'mma probably have to hit with a fork<br/>
'Til it bubble up and then rise some more<br/>
So I can bag it up for these insta folk<br/>
And sell it for the law cause they simple<br/>
If I hear "KRIT, you need to hit one more time"<br/>
Lookin' at us like "how these motherfuckers gon' under ship mine?"<br/>
Still do an interview here there<br/>
And they don't even know that I'm signed<br/>
If I wait on the label to support my vision I might go blind<br/>
Lately I've been on my tell it all get rich<br/>
Start plottin on my way I did<br/>
To show like Empire may the very thing I dreamed of look like bullshit<br/>
Kill em all, why not, King when I'm busy<br/>
Krizzle up in the blizzard and the cold <i>[?]</i><br/>
Said who was here, never really snowed in the sizzie<br/>
Fuck what ya heard, multi 'til I dizzie, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Logic:]</i><br/>
Aight, check it, it's the take<br/>
I heard y'all been checking my net worth<br/>
What the fuck is y'all doing?<br/>
Y'all ain't on my level, boy, go pay your rent first<br/>
And then maybe I'll sign you<br/>
I'm looking for talent, I hope that I find you<br/>
(Wait a minute, you asked me now let me tell you<br/>
Now here's another problem)<br/>
They probably expecting that shit for the first album, man fuck that<br/>
They'll say that I changed<br/>
And I'll say I had to show 'em my range<br/>
Cause if I do what I did then they'll say it's the same<br/>
Just can't win in this game<br/>
Money talks, that's a figure of speech, that went over their head<br/>
Like the dough that I throw in the air like I'm Papa John<br/>
That mafia money, that parmesan<br/>
My shortie's a dime, your bitches are not, pennies<br/>
Prolly take her to Dennys, we chillin at Lenny's<br/>
You know I got 99 problems, but keep it a hundred<br/>
You know that I done it<br/>
Just me and my homies, we tryna make it to the summit<br/>
Praying that we don't plummet<br/>
Like "Oh my God look at your boy know that you finally done it"<br/>
I've been writing these records from actual facts<br/>
So hopefully you learn something from it<br/>
But what I learned is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Logic:]</i><br/>
I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up, so high<br/>
I said I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up, so high<br/>
I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up<br/>
So high, so high<br/>
I've been on a grind and now they all know what's up, so high
