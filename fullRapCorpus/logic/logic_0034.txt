Ayo, I'm living abroad like the baddest bitch you've ever seen<br/>
Ain't about that hybrid shit but I'm all about the green<br/>
Making so many moves I need a dose of Dramamine<br/>
For rap I'm a fiend, come and test my team<br/>
I school MC's cause I'm the motherfucking dean<br/>
My cerebral cortex force, my trigger finger reflex<br/>
To bust techs like raw sex, ain't no tellin' what's next<br/>
I sling mixtapes like crack rocks<br/>
Watch snow bunnies chillin' in the backdrop, discussin' how the track rocks<br/>
Goddamn, I'm a miraculous man<br/>
And if I wasn't Logic, I'd be his number one fan<br/>
Beware I'm spittin' fire cause the world is in dire need of an MC to admire<br/>
And set the bar higher<br/>
So I conspire, within my mind just had a friar<br/>
The rap Messiah, fresh to death so peep the attire<br/>
Feelin' like B Rabbit when he slaughtered the Lotto<br/>
Get money, fuck bitches, and respect women is the motto<br/>
You say potato, I say potato<br/>
You call 'em rappers but all I see is comedians<br/>
My future's lookin' XXL, they shit is medium<br/>
Call me Bobby Kennedy the way I fuck with Marilyn<br/>
MCs approach, take notes, and then I bury them<br/>
I'm out of this world, my studio's the planetarium<br/>
The way I flow, this shit is slicker than butter<br/>
The second I utter lyricism that leave all the rest in the gutter<br/>
I thought I told ya'll I'm the best, d-d-did I stutter?<br/>
I'll hit your mom in the head with a car bomb just to blow her mind like Vietnam<br/>
Had a myspace account but my only friend was Tom<br/>
When I eat pussy I pretend that I'm speaking in Islam<br/>
Psych, It's a joke I swear that I'm not racist<br/>
To be honest I'll murder you no matter what color your face is<br/>
Punch you in the face if I catch you slippin' in braces<br/>
You want beef? I'll choke you to death with your own shoelaces<br/>
Psych, I swear I'm not a violent guy<br/>
Once upon time I brought a Super Soaker to a drive-by<br/>
Full of Kool-Aid and warm piss<br/>
My buzz is growing every day and when the swarm hits<br/>
Million dollar trips, sex at the Ritz<br/>
So rich I'll make bitches show Charlie Murphy their tits<br/>
Blow the competition to bits, leavin' the enemy lit<br/>
But I'm out cause there's women to please and money to get<br/>
It's Logic
