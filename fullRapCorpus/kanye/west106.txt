<i>[Travis Scott]</i><br/>
10 a.m. it's west side bitch<br/>
She see the glasses, so obvious<br/>
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here<br/>
Don't go home cause they just ran me up out of there<br/>
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night<br/>
She run her mouth, but can't eat right<br/>
Don't read between the line and forgot how to be white<br/>
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white<br/>
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us<br/>
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?<br/>
SMH, we all know that cocaine killed Abel<br/>
From the scholar letters devour this<br/>
She stepped into hell, cause winter got cold<br/>
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul<br/>
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know<br/>
Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]</i><br/>
I'm here with open arms and I gotta<br/>
Here is where her heart belongs<br/>
Her heart belongs to me<br/>
Here is where her heart<br/>
I'm here and I won't go<br/>
Without her, this is where her heart belongs<br/>
It should be here with me<br/>
Here is where her heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Teyana Taylor &amp; John Legend]</i><br/>
I beg for mercy today<br/>
They won't take me away<br/>
Take me away from you<br/>
Don't know what I would do<br/>
Don't let us die in vain<br/>
Don't let them see our pain<br/>
Wash these demons away<br/>
Wash these demons away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Malik Yusef]</i><br/>
You are all unwelcome to Sin City<br/>
Yet the population still increases its density<br/>
And that increases its intensity<br/>
Which increases the propensity<br/>
To complicate your simplicity<br/>
No matter your ethnicity<br/>
All for the sake of publicity, in this city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CyHi Da Prynce]</i><br/>
Huh, bad bitches with ass shots<br/>
Use a house as a stash spot<br/>
Lexus coupe with the rag-top<br/>
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot<br/>
I used to run with the have-nots<br/>
Kept the ave hot just so we could have knots<br/>
A lot of niggaz see they dreams in a glass pot<br/>
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot<br/>
We broke all the commandments<br/>
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched<br/>
Come spend a day in my Hamlet<br/>
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis<br/>
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis<br/>
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch<br/>
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it<br/>
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices<br/>
But this life'll take a toll on ya<br/>
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices<br/>
I know who Christ is<br/>
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous<br/>
By the age ten, we were caged in<br/>
Now they raise men in the state pen<br/>
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins<br/>
God bless the city, amen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Malik Yusef]</i><br/>
And now I'm one of the residents<br/>
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence<br/>
And all the fuckin' debauchery<br/>
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me<br/>
I always feel like, I'm almost feel like<br/>
Cause I could feel it in the air tonight<br/>
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right<br/>
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite<br/>
But I am willing to share tonight<br/>
In the city that is as unfair as life
