I know you see me now right now<br/>
(I know you see me now right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(You see)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(Right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
I got my suit and tie<br/>
And I don't know if y'all know<br/>
Well, maybe y'all do<br/>
Or maybe y'all don't<br/>
But I don't really care<br/>
It's how we on it all the time<br/>
So I'mma get my money<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Now, I'mma need you to kill the hypocrisy<br/>
This is an aristocracy<br/>
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolaty<br/>
What's up with who? That's old news<br/>
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes<br/>
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cool<br/>
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes<br/>
He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods!<br/>
That nigga crazy, I told you!<br/>
Immature adult (uh huh), insecure asshole (what else?)<br/>
And if you fall on the concrete, that's yo' ass fault<br/>
If you pass on a Kon beat, that's yo' last fault<br/>
Get what you ask for, I swear that's yo' ass, so<br/>
She got a big booty, but she couldn't drop that ass low<br/>
'Til you take yo' last ho, and rope up all the cash flow<br/>
When you gettin' money, they be all up on yo' ass, yo<br/>
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass go<br/>
Straight to jail, yo, in a hell hole<br/>
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'im I say, "Hello."<br/>
Ask him if I'mma be there soon and tell 'im I said, "Hell, no!"<br/>
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé (Kanye West):]</i><br/>
My niggas is home<br/>
I guess I got everything<br/>
Everything I want<br/>
(Let's go shopping dog, let's celebrate)<br/>
But I don't<br/>
No matter how good it gets<br/>
(Free Weezy though)<br/>
It'll never be like before<br/>
No women in the crowd<br/>
Screamin' and it's loud<br/>
Doin' things not allowed<br/>
And I swear it's goin' down right now<br/>
(You know what it is)<br/>
I know one thing, my mama would be proud<br/>
And you see me lookin' up<br/>
'Cause I know she's lookin' down right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(I know you see me now right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(Right now, right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(Right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Pour the champagne, let your watch show<br/>
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal<br/>
I admit my first watch was a Fossil<br/>
Now I'm in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils<br/>
Attention to detail is so uncanny<br/>
And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry<br/>
Somebody need to put us on camera<br/>
The world of Rollies and everyone families<br/>
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris<br/>
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Bonny's<br/>
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini<br/>
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo<br/>
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical<br/>
This the Christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two<br/>
Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder 'Ye<br/>
'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae<br/>
I got style ask June if she heard of me<br/>
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate<br/>
First of all, we all know the beats is<br/>
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus<br/>
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception<br/>
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries<br/>
Cannonball off the diving board when I am bored<br/>
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord<br/>
Rap god, Greek mythology<br/>
And this life too crazy to think logically<br/>
Here's something that you could use as an analogy<br/>
My life is like a child's illusions become reality<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Now go get my throne<br/>
'Cause I don't wanna stop<br/>
I just go in my zone<br/>
And I'mma make it hot<br/>
'Til it's time to go<br/>
When it's time to go<br/>
Where you tryna go?<br/>
You better act like you can see me now<br/>
(Exactly!)<br/>
(Rosewood)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(I know you see me now right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(Right now, right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(Right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West and Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
I know you see me<br/>
I know you see me<br/>
I know you see me<br/>
It's like I'm 3D<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(I know you see me now right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(Right now, right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(Right now)<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
I know you see me<br/>
I know you see me<br/>
I know you see me<br/>
It's like I'm 3D<br/>
I know you see me now right now<br/>
(I know you see me now right now)<br/>

<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Man today I am the freshest in the world<br/>
But that's the obvious, damn I look so sexy<br/>
And you look like a pile of shit<br/>
When I told my ex I loved her she went and married another<br/>
And changed her whole name up<br/>
You a Yugoslavi chick<br/>
"Be successful," that's what they told me<br/>
So everything I D.O. now I O.D.<br/>
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat<br/>
Shit comparing them to us, man, they gotta add Kobe<br/>
Whodie, holy moley went from G-shocking to Rolly<br/>
From the D-cop to Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley<br/>
Nah, nah baby boy you Jody in the party they all know me<br/>
Yeah, I saw your ass in line, boy, you was looking like the old me<br/>
Presidential suit, my girls Michelle and Chanel<br/>
She gave me designer uh she keep it au natural<br/>
I say it again I'm chasing cheese, dodging rat traps<br/>
Chasing pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks<br/>
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick<br/>
Oooh! You know I like that nasty shh!<br/>
Got it made in every way, getting paid every day<br/>
What Sean sound like? 'Ye protégé<br/>
Nah, he sound like he a pro to me<br/>
I know Kanye a jerk how could you say that?<br/>
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach<br/>
What kind of jerk is that?<br/>
What kind of jerks is y'all?<br/>
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off<br/>
Bet you take it off and chase him through the mall<br/>
We working twice as hard so everything come in twos<br/>
Double drinks, double girls<br/>
We be getting paid like W-2s<br/>
Rep Westside throwing up Ws<br/>
We love you Sean! I love you too!<br/>
Ooo, Ooo!<br/>
You know how I do!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West talking:]</i><br/>
Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?<br/>
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now<br/>
I know Jet magazine calling right now<br/>
You looking good today too, I like that<br/>
You got your new suit on and she got the extra cute on<br/>
I know you thinking, This that Yeezy we all love<br/>
I'm back, baby, we back, baby<br/>
Uncle Charlie, by the way<br/>
And I'mma let you finish, but I got Beyoncé on the track<br/>
That's what it is<br/>
Black excellence, baby<br/>
This is the elite<br/>
We the greatest in the world, baby!<br/>
We the greatest in the world!<br/>
Yeah, Lex Luger, No ID, Yeezy, uh
