Oh oh oho.<br/>
damn, here we go again.<br/>
Oh oh oho.<br/>
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam,<br/>
<br/>
now everything I'm not, made me everything I am.<br/>
damn, here we go again.<br/>
people talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am.<br/>
<br/>
I never be picture-perfect-Beyonce<br/>
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey<br/>
Remember him from Blackstreet<br/>
He was as black as the street was<br/>
I'll never be laid back as his beat was<br/>
I never could see why people'll reach a<br/>
Fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up<br/>
You see how I creeped up?<br/>
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?<br/>
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam<br/>
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.am<br/>
Let me know if you feel it man<br/>
'cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am<br/>
<br/>
Damn, here we go again.<br/>
everybody sayin' what's not for him<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am<br/>
damn, here we go again.<br/>
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am<br/>
<br/>
and I'm back to tear it up<br/>
haters, start your engines<br/>
I hear 'em gearin' up<br/>
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops<br/>
they forget to get their haircut<br/>
OK fair enough, the streets is flarin' up<br/>
'cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough<br/>
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidas<br/>
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows<br/>
so say goodbye to the NAACP award<br/>
goodbye to the India.Arie award<br/>
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award<br/>
but I'll just take the I-got-a-lot-of-cheese award<br/>
<br/>
damn, here we go again.<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am<br/>
damn, here we go again.<br/>
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am<br/>
<br/>
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this<br/>
but I got the facts to back this<br/>
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets<br/>
man, killing's some wack shit<br/>
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'<br/>
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?<br/>
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland<br/>
I need to talk to somebody, pastor<br/>
the church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay<br/>
the slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay<br/>
my 15 seconds up, but I got more to say<br/>
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today<br/>
<br/>
damn, here we go again.<br/>
everybody sayin' what's not for him<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am<br/>
damn, here we go again.<br/>
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
