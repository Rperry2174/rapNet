<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Lights on, I see ya face<br/>
She eat me up, she got expensive taste<br/>
I see ya dreaming, but you still awake<br/>
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake<br/>
It's cold as hell, I show and tell<br/>
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail<br/>
In this give or take World I got what it takes<br/>
Put you out your misery, Kathy Bates<br/>
I'm Young Money, I'm cash money<br/>
If we could buy time, I spend my last money<br/>
Now I'm spending time, you in a blind<br/>
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine<br/>
<br/>
(All of the lights)<br/>
<br/>
Bright lights, night lights, head lights<br/>
Shh, no lights but the infra-red lights<br/>
Yeah, long life, don't like to ask twice<br/>
You killin' me baby, this the past life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna]</i><br/>
Turn up the lights in here baby<br/>
extra bright, I want y'all to see this<br/>
turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
you know what I need<br/>
want you to see everything<br/>
Want you to see all of the lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Ready, set, now, go go, go go go til you can't go no more<br/>
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope<br/>
Westside bitch, quote, unquote<br/>
Woah there boy, don't go there hoe,<br/>
If you cross that line I might overload<br/>
I swear these lights-lights-lights be talking to me but I can't read Morse code<br/>
Why every rapper name BIG got body huh?<br/>
But every rapper named Sean got money, ooooooh<br/>
Well I guess my chances are fifty fifty<br/>
But my vision is twenty twenty so I'll be counting a hundred hundreds<br/>
(All of the lights)<br/>
Oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy<br/>
I took your chick now you want beef<br/>
and I'm just chuckling like a porky cause you spend all day with her spooning<br/>
I spend all night with her forking<br/>
That's a one way ticket to hell and they want these bullets to book it for me<br/>
Man, I'm shittin' on every statistic that said I'll be dead or fucking broke<br/>
This is History, your kids, kids, kids, kids gon book report me but, what<br/>
And I think they wanna murder me<br/>
I'm shining hard cause bitch I'm at Emergency<br/>
B-I, GOOD G, I dooo it, boi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna]</i><br/>
Turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this<br/>
Turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
You know what I need, want you to see everything<br/>
want you to see all of the lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alicia Keys]</i><br/>
Whoaa-oh-whoa<br/>
Whoaa-oh-whoa-oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Elton John]</i><br/>
I tried to tell you but all I could say is ohhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Bad decisions, good intentions<br/>
Man, I'm riding, Weezy with me<br/>
I just left out of the strip club<br/>
Made 5 thousand look like 50<br/>
I spend all my time in Houston smoke that Kush but I don't do Whitney<br/>
I don't do Britney, don't do Lindsay<br/>
I made 2 million since last Wednesday and I hate y'all<br/>
Ya'll got too much free time<br/>
Sayin' I ain't dropped shit<br/>
Everything'll be fine<br/>
Worrying 'bout your old girl,<br/>
Tryna see if she's mine<br/>
nigga she's with me, when she tells you she needs some "me" time<br/>
Its our time so fuck y'all<br/>
I really bout to go Spring break now, start taking shots in this muthafucker<br/>
And ya didn't really have all that ass, last month, girl you got some shots in that muthafucker<br/>
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucker and you thought niggas was gonna pop in this muthafucker<br/>
Uh, Young Money, Power Respect in this bitch, you would think we got the Lox in this muthafucker<br/>
I made mistakes, I made some bread, I even made a way for them to get ahead<br/>
To my surprise, nobody replacing me<br/>
Take Care and Carter IV, it wont be long 'til they could see the lights<br/>
And I'm on one, I got one<br/>
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one<br/>
So call it a night, call it a night<br/>
And I run this, and y'all know that<br/>
I take the purple and pour that<br/>
All in a Sprite, all in a Sprite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi]</i><br/>
Getting mine, baby<br/>
gotta let these niggas know, yeah<br/>
get it right, ay<br/>
you should go and get your own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i>
