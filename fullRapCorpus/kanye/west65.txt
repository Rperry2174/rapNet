Let me know<br/>
Do I still got time to grow<br/>
Things ain't always set in stone<br/>
That be known let me know<br/>
Let me<br/>
Seems like, street lights, glowin<br/>
Happen to be just like moments, passin<br/>
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and<br/>
I paid my fare see I know my destination<br/>
But I'm just not there<br/>
All the streets, glowin<br/>
Happen to be just like moments, passin<br/>
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and<br/>
I paid my fare see I know my destination<br/>
But I'm just not there<br/>
In the streets<br/>
In the, streets<br/>
I'm just not there in the streets<br/>
I'm just not there<br/>
Life's just not fair<br/>
Seems like, street lights, glowin<br/>
Happen to be just like moments, passin<br/>
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and<br/>
I paid my fare see I know my destination<br/>
But I'm just not there<br/>
All the street lights, glowin<br/>
Happen to be just like moments, passin<br/>
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and<br/>
I paid my fare see I know my destination<br/>
But I'm just not there<br/>
All the street lights, glowin<br/>
Happen to be just like moments, passin<br/>
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and<br/>
I paid my fare see I know my destination<br/>
But I'm just not there<br/>
In the streets<br/>
In the, streets<br/>
I'm just not there in the streets<br/>
I'm just not there<br/>
Life's just not fair<br/>
Life's just not fair
