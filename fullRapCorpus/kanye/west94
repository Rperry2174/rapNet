<i>[Chorus – Mr Hudson:]</i><br/>
Ooh, I love you so<br/>
But why I love you<br/>
I’ll never know<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Picture if you will, that the throne was burning<br/>
Rome was burning, and I’m sitting in the corner all alone burning<br/>
Why does it always end up like this?<br/>
Something that we don’t determine<br/>
Same people that I fought for<br/>
That I fight for, that I ride for<br/>
That I live for, that I die for<br/>
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for<br/>
And they want me dead<br/>
But I’m so sorry but I just can’t die for you<br/>
But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you<br/>
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th<br/>
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?<br/>
When the grief is over, beef is over, I’ll be fly when Easter’s over<br/>
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings<br/>
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers<br/>
So the love is gone, til blood is drawn<br/>
So we no longer wear the same uniform<br/>
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller<br/>
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller<br/>
And truth be told after all that said<br/>
Niggas still got love for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus – Mr Hudson:]</i><br/>
Ooh, I love you so<br/>
But why I love you<br/>
I’ll never know<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]</i><br/>
Showed love to you niggas<br/>
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it<br/>
I picked up the pieces, before you swept on it<br/>
God damn this shit leaves a mess don’t it<br/>
Shit feelin’ like death don’t it<br/>
Charge it to the game, whatever’s left on it<br/>
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it<br/>
Fly pelican fly, turn the jets on it<br/>
But first I shall digress on it<br/>
Wasn’t I a good king?<br/>
(Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)<br/>
Didn’t I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?<br/>
(Huh, I gave you my loyalty)<br/>
Made you royalty and royalties<br/>
(Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)<br/>
And this is how niggas rewardin’ me<br/>
(Damn)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus – Mr Hudson:]</i><br/>
Ooh, I love you so<br/>
But why I love you<br/>
I’ll never know<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]</i><br/>
Bussin’ at me, b-b-b-bussin’ at me<br/>
But I’m bullet proof, bitch you can’t get nothin’ past me<br/>
Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)<br/>
And I’m bussin’ back, so niggas in a glass house should not throw stones<br/>
What do you do when the love turns to hate?<br/>
(Gotta separate from these fuckin’ fakes)<br/>
Caesar didn’t see it so he ceased to exist<br/>
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit<br/>
Am I my brother’s keeper?<br/>
(Only if that nigga don’t creep up)<br/>
Got a pistol under my pillow<br/>
(I’ve never been a deep sleeper)<br/>
P-p-p-paranoia<br/>
(Cause the nigga that said he’ll…)<br/>
Blast for ya (Is now…)<br/>
Blastin’ for ya, that’s an assassin for ya<br/>
(These niggas got a shot they’ll shoot)<br/>
Please Lord (Forgive him)<br/>
For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)
