Us living as we do upside-down<br/>
And the new word to have is revolution<br/>
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel<br/>
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued<br/>
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey<br/>
The youngsters who were programmed<br/>
To continue fucking up woke up one night<br/>
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys<br/>
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes<br/>
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina<br/>
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal<br/>
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault<br/>
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume<br/>
America was a bastard<br/>
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country<br/>
Whose legs were then spread around the world<br/>
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM<br/>
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names<br/>
That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'<br/>
In the mother country's crotch<br/>
What does Webster say about soul?<br/>
"All I want is a good home and a wife<br/>
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"<br/>
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you<br/>
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?<br/>
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?<br/>
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?<br/>
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?<br/>
