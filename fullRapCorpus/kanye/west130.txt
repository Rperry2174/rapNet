Turn it up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Step up in this bitch like (turn it up!)<br/>
I'm the one your bitch like<br/>
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like<br/>
And I be talkin' shit like<br/>
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight<br/>
And she grabbin' on my dick like<br/>
She wanna see if it'll fit right<br/>
That's just the wave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Waves don't die<br/>
Let me crash here for the moment<br/>
I don't need to own it<br/>
No lie<br/>
Waves don't die, baby<br/>
Let me crash here for a moment<br/>
Baby I don't, I don't need to own...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Sun don't shine in the shade (turn it up!)<br/>
Bird can't fly in a cage (turn it up!)<br/>
Even when somebody go away (turn it up!)<br/>
The feelings don't really go away<br/>
That's just the wave (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Waves don't die<br/>
Let me crash here for the moment<br/>
I don't need to own it<br/>
No lie<br/>
Waves don't die, baby<br/>
Let me crash here for a moment<br/>
Baby I don't, I don't need to own you<br/>
<br/>
No lie<br/>
No lie<br/>
No lie<br/>
You set the night on fire<br/>
I'm still gon' be here in the morning<br/>
No lie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown &amp; Theophilus London:]</i><br/>
No lie<br/>
Ooh baby, ooh baby<br/>
You set the night on fire<br/>
I'm still gon' be here in the morning<br/>
No lie
