<i>[Swizz:]</i><br/>
Welcome to the jungle<br/>
Welcome to the jungle well<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.<br/>
She turned around and looked at me and she said "alive"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz:]</i><br/>
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Black Axl Rose, move halfs and wholes<br/>
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov<br/>
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears<br/>
Work pots and pans, just to cop me some Airs<br/>
My uncle died, my daddy did too<br/>
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move<br/>
My nephew gone, my heart is torn<br/>
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born<br/>
My faith in God, every day is hard<br/>
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God<br/>
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all<br/>
So que sera, get a case of Ciroc<br/>
Let it chase the pain, before it goes too far<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
My dreams is big, reality set in<br/>
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,<br/>
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas<br/>
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it<br/>
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise<br/>
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5<br/>
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin<br/>
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending<br/>
Where the fuck is the sun?<br/>
It's been a while, momma, look at ya son<br/>
What happened to my smile?<br/>
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket<br/>
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it<br/>
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low<br/>
God damn I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?<br/>
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment<br/>
I look in the mirror, my only opponent<br/>
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Press?<br/>
Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed<br/>
No crying in public, just lying to judges<br/>
Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz:]</i><br/>
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well<br/>
Goddammit!
