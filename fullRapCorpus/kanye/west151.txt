<i>[Pharrell:]</i><br/>
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?<br/>
the muthafucking skateboard P<br/>
knowing that your mee lo<br/>
playing games like you’re cee-lo<br/>
in a tight situation like speedo’s<br/>
you can have it your way like Carlito<br/>
my nigga will be happy to give you torpedos<br/>
and have you car twisted like a blunt<br/>
for you faggot ass niggas that like to front<br/>
I’m on some BBC bape shit<br/>
I'm on some cake shit<br/>
in the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron<br/>
you hating and you want to erase it<br/>
close your eyes when you know you can’t take it<br/>
my flow interrupts your homeostasis<br/>
I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis<br/>
you talk street shit it sound like sweet shit<br/>
straight liquorice you niggas sound ticklish<br/>
80k large for the Hermes dream<br/>
coke n crop in all your magazines<br/>
hunger strike yourself, look like Celine<br/>
Dion, me and my niggas like freon<br/>
you bitches on my pecan<br/>
she got an ass you can eat on<br/>
try to play tough like the leather on a Vuiton<br/>
I hit it til I could seat on<br/>
try to get her freak on<br/>
ask me to R Kelly ya and get pee’d on<br/>
I said it ain't me maam<br/>
that 8 behind me still got the burner<br/>
yes the enzo is stilll black like Sojourner<br/>
truth, I mighta just loosened a tooth<br/>
spittin’ what I did in the booth<br/>
I’m out, pooof!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco:]</i><br/>
Carrera, raised in a teenage mutant ninja turtle era<br/>
wanna bear n tell the truth, I dare ya<br/>
ya lie, so eat these whole bottle of these jalapeno peppers<br/>
for terror made in america too live<br/>
fuck the property or give me my props properly<br/>
high off life this high technology, DeVry<br/>
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rapology<br/>
my policy’s not to be dishonestly deprived<br/>
so gimme that, gimme that, keep going<br/>
where my city at, I’m like steak and fries but never die<br/>
they wanna Ghostface wanna be me<br/>
but they will post haste follow me into the after life<br/>
that means you going right after I’ve<br/>
but I’m the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow<br/>
so someway somehow I have survived<br/>
ha ha surprised<br/>
who is he that we see coming over the tides<br/>
in a speed boat, boat load of pride<br/>
Fall of Rome, dress shirted and mastermind tie<br/>
he what happens when rappping and happen the fashion collide<br/>
so OMG is the "C" from the C-R-S LOL’ing at you haters<br/>
tell your BFF’s like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Yes, Mr West turn that new child rebel<br/>
loud as a badass child level<br/>
who need a chorus we through with a tyrannosaurus<br/>
tyrone it’s been a year with no phone<br/>
could you explain how high is your zone<br/>
we’ll take the plane rub his nose in cocaine<br/>
there’s hoes in magazines you lame sayin you lame<br/>
and for the hate in advance, pull down your pants<br/>
make ‘em kiss both cheeks like we living in France<br/>
Diamonds blue, business manager’s Jewish<br/>
and if I get sued my lawyers Jews<br/>
some girls do, grab the cojones<br/>
say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra Loan-us<br/>
brand new ferrari’s I gotta make the donuts<br/>
C-R-S is like a hip hop Christmas bonus<br/>
niggas is hating on the internet I couldn’t tell<br/>
I was too busy rapping GOOD as hell<br/>
I was too busy flying, parasail!<br/>
tell collect to get the new shit that Paris sell<br/>
Tarantino, Da Vinci, gettin’ Benji’s, get half off Fendi<br/>
half of that’s to Cindy’s<br/>
hoped out the spaceship on my Mork and Mindy<br/>
popped too many corks to let you dork’s offend me<br/>
props in New York but Chi town’s the city<br/>
get my city hoochie’s Gucci, Monica Bellucci’s<br/>
are those the real millionnaires or the bendi’s?<br/>
I’m so ultra I’m even over Oprah<br/>
but let me check your account, haha no sir<br/>
<br/>
Don’t stop, don't stop...
