<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
What of the dollar you murdered for<br/>
Is that the one fighting for your soul<br/>
Or your brother’s the one that you’re running from<br/>
But if you got money, fuck it, 'cause I want some<br/>
<br/>
B.I.G.<br/>
Fucking with me<br/>
Oh god<br/>
Whoa<br/>
OK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook — Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my<br/>
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique<br/>
Ain’t nobody fresher than my motherfucking<br/>
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique<br/>
As I look around, they don’t do it like my<br/>
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique<br/>
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the<br/>
They want the, they want the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 — Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say<br/>
My block behind me like I’m coming out the driveway<br/>
It’s grind-day, from Friday, to next Friday<br/>
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day<br/>
She tryna get me that poo tang<br/>
I might let my crew bang<br/>
My crew deeper than Wu Tang<br/>
I’m rolling with (Huh) fuck I’m saying?<br/>
Girl, you know my crew name<br/>
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!<br/>
I’m pullin’ up in that Bruce Wanye<br/>
But I’m the fuckin’ villain, man, they kneeling when I walking in the building<br/>
Freaky women I be feelin’ from the bank accounts I’m fillin’<br/>
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be<br/>
Young player from the D that’s killin’ everything that he see<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yeah am talking Ye’, yeah am talking Rih’, yeah I’m talking B, nigga I’m talking me<br/>
Yeah I’m talking bossy, I ain’t talking Kelis<br/>
Your money too short, you can’t be talking to me<br/>
Yeah I’m talking LeBron, we balling our family tree<br/>
G.O.O.D. Music drug dealing drug cousin, ain’t nothing fuckin’ with we, me<br/>
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250, 250 to a half a milli, ain’t nothin’ nobody can do with me<br/>
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or jefe<br/>
Translation, I’m the shit. Least that what my neck say, least that what my check say<br/>
Lost my homie for a decade, nigga down for like 12 years, ain’t hug his son since the second grade<br/>
He never told, who we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole<br/>
It’s the dream team meets the supreme team, and all our eyes green and only means one thing<br/>
You ain’t fuckin’ with my clique<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Break records at Louis<br/>
Ate breakfast at Gucci<br/>
My girl a superstar all from a home movie<br/>
Bow on our arrival the un-American idols<br/>
What niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel<br/>
Yeah I’m talking business<br/>
We talking CIA<br/>
I’m talking George Tenet<br/>
I seen him the other day<br/>
He asked me about my Maybach<br/>
Think he had the same<br/>
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented<br/>
You know white people get money don’t spend it<br/>
Or maybe they get money, buy a business<br/>
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig’nant<br/>
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me but let me finish<br/>
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits<br/>
Them gold master p ceilings was just a figment<br/>
Of our imagination, MTV cribs<br/>
Now I’m looking at a crib right next to where TC lives<br/>
That’s Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse<br/>
He wasn’t really drunk he just had a few brews<br/>
Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage<br/>
Everything I do need a news crew presence<br/>
Speed Boat swerve homie, watch out for the waves<br/>
I’m way too black to burn from sun rays<br/>
So I just meditated the home in Pompeii<br/>
About how I could build a new Rome in one day<br/>
Every time I’m in Vegas they screaming like he’s Elvis<br/>
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it<br/>
Shit is real got me feelin’ Isrealian<br/>
Like Bar Refaeli Gisele, no that's Brazilian<br/>
Went through deep depression when my mamma passed<br/>
Suicide what kind of talk is that<br/>
But I’ve been talking to God for so long<br/>
That if have you look in my life I guess he talking back<br/>
Fuckin’ with my clique<br/>
<br/>
