<i>[Jay-Z - Intro]</i><br/>
Is this thing on?<br/>
Oh, I thought they silenced us, 'Ye<br/>
Power to the people<br/>
<br/>
We're living in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit<br/>
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private<br/>
New watches (you know what time it is) <br/>
Watch us (you see us)<br/>
They can't stop us<br/>
The prophets<br/>
Beotches!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye West]</i><br/>
No one man should have all that power (Yea!)<br/>
The clock's tickin, I just count the hours (Yea!)<br/>
Stop trippin, I'm tripin off the power <br/>
("No one man should have all that power!" - <i>[King Crimson]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Rumble young man, rumble<br/>
Life is a trip so sometimes we gon' stumble<br/>
You gotta go through pain in order to become you<br/>
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you<br/>
Man, you got the power to do anything you want to<br/>
Until you ask yourself, "Is that what it's all come to?"<br/>
Looking at life through sunglasses in the sunroof<br/>
Do you have the power to get out from up under you<br/>
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you<br/>
They trying to ask who/Axl Rose you, (Welcome to the Jungle!)<br/>
To be continued, we're on that Norman Mailer shit<br/>
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift<br/>
Tell 'em this!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
No one man should have all that power...<i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend (Kanye)]</i><br/>
Yea-ei-yea-ei-yea-ei-yea-ei-YEAAAAAAA-EAH<br/>
OH OH (And is it?) YEA-EAH (And is it?)<br/>
OH OH (And is it?) YEA-EAH (And is it?)<br/>
OH OH (And is it?) YEA-EAH (And is it?)<br/>
{"No one man should have all that power!" - <i>[King Crimson]</i>}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Now when I walk in everybody do the power clap - clap, clap, clap<br/>
Fresh for the club, I just took an half an hour nap - clap, clap, clap<br/>
I seen people go crazy when the whole world in our lap - Clap, clap, clap<br/>
My psyche was out the plug, now it's time to get the power back - Clap, clap<br/>
<br/>
I've seen people abuse power, use power, misuse and then lose power<br/>
Power to the people, at last! It's a new hour<br/>
Now we all ain't gon' be American Idols <br/>
But you can 'least grab a camera, shoot a viral<br/>
Huuuh? Take the power in your own hands<br/>
I'm a grown man, doin my grown dance<br/>
I don't stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch<br/>
I'm on my Van Gogh, I don't hear shit<br/>
No one man should have all that power<br/>
The clock's tickin, I just count the hours<br/>
Stop trippin, I'm trippin off the power <br/>
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend]</i><br/>
EYY-YEAAAAH<br/>
OH OH (And is it?) YEA-EAH (And is it?)<br/>
OH OH (And is it?) YEA-EAH (And is it?)<br/>
OH OH (And is it?) YEA-EAH (And is it?)<br/>
Eh-ay, eh-ay, eh-ay, eh-ay (The power)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Now everything I'm rhymin on cause a Ramadon<br/>
Been a don prayin for families lost in the storm<br/>
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran<br/>
So the next couple bars I'ma drop 'em in Islam<br/>
They say as-salaam alaikum, we say alaikum as-salaam/salam'<br/>
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom<br/>
Now the question is how we gon' stop the next, Vietnam<br/>
Keep, Flex out of Korea 'cause you know we drop bombs! <br/>
<i>[explosion and music stops]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz Beatz - breakdown as beat changes]</i><br/>
Showtime!<br/>
Aiyyo Yeezy man, stop playin wit these people man<br/>
They wanna see you act all crazy in this muh'fucker man<br/>
Take that jacket off an go crazy on them niggaz man<br/>
Ya'knahmtalkin BOUT? {"I GOT THE POWER!" - <i>[Snap!]</i>}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West (Swizz Beatz)]</i><br/>
What do it mean to be the boss? (OH!)<br/>
It means second place is the first one who lost (OH!)<br/>
The crucifixion, the being nailed to the cross (OH!)<br/>
The truth or fiction, it's a hell of a cost (BOP!)<br/>
Do the dishes, I'm 'bout to hit that Jeff Gordon (AY!)<br/>
Michael Jordan is the only one more important (AY!)<br/>
But I be feelin like Jordan when I'm recording (C'mon!)<br/>
'Cause everytime I record, I dunk and slam the booooards<br/>

Eating Wheaties, drinkin Fiji, bein greedy, huh? (C'mon!)<br/>
Don't even think you can elude to the rumors (C'mon!)<br/>
I'm immune to the boos, I'ma PROVE to you losers -- {"I GOT THE POWER!" - <i>[Snap!]</i>}<br/>
(Huh!) It's all in timing, nigga (Get 'em!)<br/>
See I dream my whole life that I could rhyme with Jigga (Get 'em!) <br/>
Now Jay my big brother, and B my lil' sister (Get 'em!)<br/>
And excuse me, but, you cain't see my lil' sister (HANDS IN THE AIR!)<br/>
Number one sound across the board - HEY! (OH!)<br/>
Number one now and forever more - HEY! (HEY!)<br/>
Number one rule is niggas gon' HATE!<br/>
Maybe I drop the album - naaaaah, y'all gotta wait (Oh!)<br/>
And on the net, they showin pictures of my Cali place<br/>
My Maybach in NY, but it still got the Cali plates<br/>
All my ol' gurls know that I'm the one that got away (Whoo!)<br/>
I think about her Christmas and play some Donny Hathaway (AY!)<br/>
And keep my bulletproof, hater coat on (Chill...chill! Chill! Yo!)<br/>
Lookin at some photos that I'm lookin crazy dope on<br/>
Hand up, talkin shit, yeah I get my Pope on (Yo!)<br/>

That's what Dre said, but this what 'Ye said (Huh!)<br/>
How 'Ye doin? Who 'Ye screwin? (Huh!)<br/>
That's for my dick to know, befo' you get to know 'em<br/>
She ain't gave you ass, that pussy fictional<br/>
I gotta give her the eviction no-tice<br/>
"Getcho ass out, bitch! Vamanos!"<br/>
Five seconds to the song end, we gettin close<br/>
I got the power muh'fucker if you didn't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz Beatz - Outro]</i><br/>
