<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Turn my headphones up<br/>
Louder<br/>
Uh-huh, uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
(What you need, what, what you need)<br/>
(What you need, what, what you need)<br/>
Oh (I got what you need)<br/>
<br/>
Hello, hello, hello, White America, assassinate my character<br/>
Money matrimony, yeah, they tryna break the marriage up<br/>
Who gon’ act phonier? Who gon’ try to embarrass ya?<br/>
I’ma need a day off, I think I’ll call Ferris up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Bueller had a Mueller, but I switched it for a Miele<br/>
‘Cause I’m richer, and prior to this shit was movin’ freebase<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West (Jay-Z):]</i><br/>
Had a conference with the DJs (Yeah), Puerto Rico three-days<br/>
(Parlay with them GDs, now they got our shit on replay)<br/>
Sorry I’m in pajamas, but I just got off the PJ<br/>
And last party we had, they shut down Prive<br/>
(Ain’t that where the Heat play?) Yep (Niggas hate ballers these days)<br/>
Ain’t that like LeBron James? (Ain’t that just like D-Wade)<br/>
(Wait)<br/>
<br/>
(What you need, what, what you need)<br/>
(I got what you need, what, what you)<br/>
(What you need, what, what you need)<br/>
(I got what you need)<br/>
(Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]</i><br/>
Wassup, ma’fucka, where my money at?<br/>
You gon’ make me come down to your house where yo’ mummy at<br/>
Mummy wrap the kids, have ‘em cryin’ for they mummy back<br/>
Dummy that your daddy is, tell ‘em I just want my racks<br/>
(Racks on racks on racks) Racks<br/>
(Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs) Who in that?<br/>
(Oh shit, it’s just blacks on blacks on blacks)<br/>
(Hundred stack) How you get it? (Nigga, layin’ raps on tracks)<br/>
I wish I could give you this feelin’, I’m planking on a million<br/>
I’m riding through yo’ hood, you can bank I ain’t got no ceiling<br/>
(Made a left on Nostrand Ave.) Right (We in Bed Stuy)<br/>
Made a right on 79th, I’m coming down South Shore Drive<br/>
(I remain Chi-town) Brooklyn ‘til I die<br/>
<br/>
(Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home…)<br/>
(Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home…)<br/>
(I got what you need, what, what you need)<br/>
(Take ‘em on home)<br/>
(What you need, what, what you need)<br/>
(I got what you need, what, what you need)<br/>
(Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home…)<br/>
(Take ‘em on home, take ‘em on home…)<br/>
(Tryna hurt my name, huh?)
