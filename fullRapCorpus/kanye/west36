<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cuz I'm so proud of you<br/>
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)<br/>
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school<br/>
I appreciate what you allowed for me<br/>
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine<br/>
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine<br/>
I'm finna take yall back to them better times<br/>
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind<br/>
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi<br/>
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold<br/>
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul<br/>
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?<br/>
You work late nights just to keep on the lights<br/>
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike<br/>
And you would give anything in this world<br/>
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl<br/>
And you never put no man over me<br/>
And I love you for that mommy cant you see?<br/>
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes<br/>
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry<br/>
As we knelt on the kitchen floor<br/>
I said mommy Imma love you till you don't hurt no more<br/>
And when I'm older, you aint gotta work no more<br/>
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford<br/>
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable<br/>
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot<br/>
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do<br/>
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates<br/>
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate<br/>
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with<br/>
But still supported me when I did the opposite<br/>
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get<br/>
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you<br/>
You was getting through, can the choir please<br/>
Give me a verse of "You, Are So Beautiful To Me"<br/>
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry<br/>
Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy<br/>
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet<br/>
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I guess it also depends tho, if my ends low<br/>
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo<br/>
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Tell your job you gotta fake em out<br/>
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out<br/>
To a restaurant, upper echelon<br/>
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want<br/>
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?<br/>
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right<br/>
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday<br/>
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (with variations)]</i>
