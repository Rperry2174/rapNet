<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Lost out, beat up<br/>
Dancin', down there<br/>
I found you, somewhere out<br/>
'Round 'round there, right right there<br/>
Lost and beat up<br/>
Down there, dancin'<br/>
I found you, somewhere out<br/>
Right down there, right 'round there<br/>
<br/>
Lost and, found out<br/>
Turned out, how you thought<br/>
Daddy, found out<br/>
How you turned out, how you turned out<br/>
If mama knew now<br/>
How you turned out, you too wild<br/>
You too wild, you too wild<br/>
You too wild, I need you now<br/>
Got to love you<br/>
Found you, found you<br/>
Right now, right now<br/>
Right now, right now<br/>
If your mama knew how<br/>
You turned out, you too wild<br/>
You too wild, you too wild<br/>
You too wild, and I need you now<br/>
Lost and found now<br/>
<br/>
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph<br/>
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip<br/>
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip<br/>
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this<br/>
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'<br/>
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo<br/>
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow<br/>
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow<br/>
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow<br/>
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow<br/>
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow<br/>
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow<br/>
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage<br/>
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich<br/>
I said baby what if you was clubbin'<br/>
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?<br/>
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club<br/>
When she met Joseph around hella thugs?<br/>
Cover Nori in lambs' wool<br/>
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"<br/>
"What if Mary was in the club<br/>
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?<br/>
Cover Saint in lambs' wool<br/>
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
The rings all ring out<br/>
Burn out, cave in<br/>
Blackened to dark out<br/>
I'm mixed now, fleshed out<br/>
There's light with no heat<br/>
We cooled out, it's cool out<br/>
Life is precious<br/>
We found out, we found out<br/>
We found out
