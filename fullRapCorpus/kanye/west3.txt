<i>[Chorus - 4x]</i><br/>
Oh when it all, it all falls down<br/>
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Kanye West]</i><br/>
Man I promise, she's so self conscious<br/>
She has no idea what she's doing in college<br/>
That major that she majored in don't make no money<br/>
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny<br/>
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre<br/>
The concept of school seems so securrre<br/>
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr<br/>
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair<br/>
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs<br/>
Cause her baby daddy don't really care<br/>
She's so precious with the peer pressure<br/>
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)<br/>
She had hair so long that it looked like weave<br/>
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve<br/>
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe<br/>
Single black female addicted to retail and well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Kanye West]</i><br/>
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious<br/>
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches<br/>
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy<br/>
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!<br/>
Then I spent 400 bucks on this<br/>
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!<br/>
And I can't even go to the grocery store<br/>
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team<br/>
It seems we living the american dream<br/>
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem<br/>
The prettiest people do the ugliest things<br/>
For the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us<br/>
We trying to buy back our 40 acres<br/>
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop<br/>
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Kanye West]</i><br/>
I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em<br/>
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom<br/>
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em<br/>
Things we buy to cover up what's inside<br/>
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth<br/>
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"<br/>
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack<br/>
And a white man get paid off of all of that<br/>
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou<br/>
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou<br/>
Before I had a house and I'd do it again<br/>
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz<br/>
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific<br/>
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific<br/>
I got a problem with spending before I get it<br/>
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - to fade (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]</i>
