This was founded years ago<br/>
By broke slaves, years ago<br/>
Who did not have, years ago<br/>
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago<br/>
Who did not have when we could not eat <br/>
Hmm, remember that?<br/>
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm?<br/>
Do you remember all those Christmases when your Mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh?<br/>
Remember that?
