<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Sweet King Martin<br/>
Sweet Queen Coretta<br/>
Sweet Brother Malcolm<br/>
Sweet Queen Betty<br/>
Sweet Mother Mary<br/>
Sweet Father Joseph,<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Jesus<br/>
We made it in America<br/>
Sweet baby Jesus, ooh<br/>
Oh sweet baby Jesus<br/>
We made it in America<br/>
Sweet baby Jesus, ooh<br/>
Oh, sweet baby Jesus,<br/>
We made it in America<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I told my mama I was on the come up<br/>
She said "you going to school I'll give you a summer"<br/>
Then she met NO ID and gave me his number<br/>
10 years later she driving a Hummer<br/>
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye<br/>
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay<br/>
And I'm rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy<br/>
I guess I'm getting high off my own supply<br/>
Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic<br/>
Started a little blog just to get some traffic<br/>
Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic<br/>
A million hits and the web crashes â€“ damn!<br/>
South Park had 'em all laughing<br/>
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin'<br/>
Ignore the critics just to say we did it<br/>
This ain't no fashion show, motherfucker, we live it<br/>

Sweet Jesus<br/>
We made it in America<br/>
Sweet baby Jesus, ooh<br/>
Oh sweet baby Jesus<br/>
We made it in America<br/>
Sweet baby Jesus, ooh<br/>
Oh, sweet baby Jesus,<br/>
We made it in America<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma<br/>
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana<br/>
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm &amp; Hammer<br/>
Straight out the kitchen, shh don't wake Nana!<br/>
Built a republic, that still stands<br/>
I'm trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man's<br/>
Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water<br/>
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order<br/>
Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up YaYa?<br/>
What's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some agua<br/>
No papa, bad Santa<br/>
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners<br/>
I got my liberty, chopping grams up<br/>
Street justice, I pray God understand us<br/>
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers<br/>
This is the Star Spangled Banner<br/>
<br/>

Sweet baby Jesus, ooh<br/>
Oh sweet baby Jesus<br/>
We made it in America<br/>
Sweet baby Jesus, ooh<br/>
Oh, sweet baby Jesus,<br/>
We made it in America
