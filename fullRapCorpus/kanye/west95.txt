<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
1985 white Lamborghini Countach, 2 of em<br/>
<br/>
I need a slow motion video right now<br/>
Cause I’m moving in slow motion, slow motion<br/>
Feelin’ like Hype Williams shooting a nigga<br/>
Shooting a nigga, hey hey hey<br/>
I need a slow motion video right now ay ay<br/>
<br/>
Damn baby, pussy can’t be your only hustle<br/>
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell<br/>
I mean a lot of niggas got money<br/>
So basically, Russell ain’t the only Russell<br/>
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe<br/>
Zero Zero Zero Zero, a whole lot of 0’s<br/>
What you after, actor money?<br/>
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money<br/>
Bullet proof condom when I’m in these hoes<br/>
Got staples on my dick (why) fuckin’ centerfolds<br/>
And I swear to God they so cold<br/>
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes<br/>
I got my fur on feelin’ like Jerome<br/>
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on<br/>
Don’t look at the jewelry, or get your blurr on<br/>
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose<br/>
Get back, you overclose<br/>
Oh no, the hood was strugglin’<br/>
But then I blessed them with that Polo<br/>
Niggas was making music and then my first solo…<br/>
Collo Drolo sponsored by Manolo<br/>
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos<br/>
Yeah and I’m cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed<br/>
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos<br/>
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]</i><br/>
Take it how you want til a nigga dead<br/>
(Til then I’m the illest motherfucker alive)<br/>
Whole world aiming at a nigga head<br/>
(Because I’m the illest motherfucker alive)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Holla, King Hov, I’m exactly what the fuck you think<br/>
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings, Michael Jordan swag<br/>
Y'all think Michael Jordan bad<br/>
Nigga I got a 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had<br/>
Elvis has left the building now I’m on the Beatles ass<br/>
Niggas hear Watch The Throne, yeah it’s like the Beatles back<br/>
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family<br/>
Imagine how that’s gon' look front row at the Grammy's<br/>
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy’s couch<br/>
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house<br/>
I don’t even know what we doing here<br/>
Seems to me a complete waste of gear<br/>
Just a fuckin waste of time, a complete waste of bottles<br/>
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin’ all the models<br/>
Got the over-sized Rolley let me show the how to do it<br/>
When I say it then you see, it ain’t only in the music<br/>
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses<br/>
My house like a museum, so I see em when I’m peeing<br/>
Usually you have this much taste you European<br/>
That’s the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again<br/>
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learned that<br/>
This is where DiNero would be if he ain’t turn back<br/>
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life<br/>
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I need a slow motion video right now<br/>
Cause I’m moving in slow motion slow motion<br/>
Feelin’ like Hype Williams shooting a nigga<br/>
Shooting a nigga hey hey hey<br/>
I need a slow motion video right now ay ay<br/>
<br/>
Slow motion slow motion...
