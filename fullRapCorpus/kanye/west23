<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly<br/>
For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky<br/>
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly<br/>
For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky<br/>
<br/>
Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,<br/>
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.<br/>
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).<br/>
Now let's go.<br/>
Take 'em back to the plan...<br/>
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.<br/>
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,<br/>
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.<br/>
Let's take 'em back to the club.<br/>
Least about an hour I would stand on line,<br/>
I just wanted to dance.<br/>
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.<br/>
I just wanted to shine.<br/>
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"<br/>
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"<br/>
A hip hop legend.<br/>
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1 (P. Diddy)]</i><br/>
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la<br/>
(Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)<br/>
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la<br/>
(Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)<br/>
<br/>
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,<br/>
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,<br/>
I'd do anything to say "I got it".<br/>
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.<br/>
Before anybody wanted K-West beats,<br/>
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.<br/>
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,<br/>
Like "Damn, these niggas that much better than me?"<br/>
Baby, I'm going on an airplane,<br/>
And I don't know if I'll be back again.<br/>
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,<br/>
But when she came to kick it, things became different.<br/>
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.<br/>
I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.<br/>
I'm trying to write my wrongs,<br/>
But it's funny these same wrongs helped me write this song.<br/>
Now,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly<br/>
For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky<br/>
(You gonna touch the sky babygirl!) Testify, come up in the spot<br/>
Looking extra fly<br/>
For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?<br/>
Lupe steal like Lupin the Third.<br/>
Hear like ear till I'm beer on the curb<br/>
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge<br/>
Slow it down like we're on the syrup<br/>
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.<br/>
But, before you say another word,<br/>
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street.<br/>
I'm trying to stop lion like a Mum-Ra,<br/>
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.<br/>
Engarge, touch√© Lupe cool as the unthawed<br/>
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.<br/>
I come as correct as a porn star,<br/>
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.<br/>
So, I represent the first.<br/>
Now, let me end my verse right where the horns are like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 (P. Diddy)]</i><br/>
(We back at home, baby)<br/>
Sky high<br/>
I'm, I'm sky high<br/>
I'm, I'm sky high<br/>
I'm, I'm sky high<br/>
I'm, I'm sky high<br/>
I'm, I'm sky high<br/>
Sky, Sky high<br/>
I'm, I'm sky high<br/>
Yeah! (Keep it rolling)<br/>
(Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!)
