Now beat that<br/>
And your mothers sayin “go to college”<br/>
So u finish college and its wonderful<br/>
U feel so good<br/>
And after all the partying and crazing<br/>
And don’t forget about that drug habit u picked up at school bein around your peers<br/>
Hey now you’ll get that  25 thou, job a year and  <br/>
You’ll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it’ll be you’re your money<br/>
No more borrowin money from mom for my high<br/>
So now you get ur degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it<br/>
If u continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!<br/>
You’ll come in at an entry level position and when u do that<br/>
If u kiss enough ass, you’ll move up to the next level<br/>
Which is being a secretary’s secretary!<br/>
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary <br/>
Who never went to college<br/>
Shes actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family<br/>
You know what college does for you?<br/>
It makes you really smart man<br/>
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok<br/>
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be, <br/>
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes<br/>
No I’ve never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied<br/>
When a lady walks to me says “hey u know whats sexy?”<br/>
I say “no, I don’t know what it is, but I bet I can add up all the change in your purse very fast”.
