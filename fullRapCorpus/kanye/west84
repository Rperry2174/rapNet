<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
We gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars<br/>
How many people you know can take it this far?<br/>
I’m supercharged<br/>
I’m ’bout to take this whole thing to Mars<br/>
<br/>
Now we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars<br/>
You don’t know what we been through to make it this far<br/>
So many scars<br/>
‘Bout to take this whole thing to Mars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Lift off<br/>
Lift off, takin’ my coat off<br/>
Showin’ my tattoos, I’m such a showoff (Huh?)<br/>
I feel the pain and then rolled off<br/>
I got the whole city, they about to go off<br/>
How many niggas wit’ me up in this bitch?<br/>
How many people wanna roll with me now?<br/>
Like you know na na na, you know me by now<br/>
Know me, know me by now<br/>
