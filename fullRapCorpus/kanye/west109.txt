<i>[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]</i><br/>
Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world<br/>
You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls<br/>
So tempt me to jetset away in London<br/>
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany<br/>
Ohh (La la la la la la la la)<br/>
I love the way we livin' boy<br/>
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"<br/>
So let's run away, let's run away<br/>
Momma say I'm too young for love<br/>
And lovin' you's all I'm thinkin' of<br/>
My heart tells me that you're the one<br/>
It's the feeling you give, it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Teyana Taylor]</i><br/>
Pure bliss<br/>
Like you've got the key to my heart<br/>
Simple as a touch and a kiss<br/>
Never knew a feeling like this<br/>
Pure bliss, pure bliss<br/>
Nobody can tear us apart<br/>
Baby it's as good as it gets<br/>
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss)<br/>
Loving you will never be hard<br/>
This is pure bliss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: John Legend]</i><br/>
I remember when the pilot closed the door<br/>
Said it's time for lift off<br/>
You said, "What'd you choose me for?"<br/>
But don't ever wonder<br/>
Cause you deserve the best<br/>
Once you reach the top<br/>
You'll never question why you left<br/>
Oh, my world is yours<br/>
What you waitin' for?<br/>
Let's run away, let's run away<br/>
Our friends, say we're crazy<br/>
But we can't listen baby<br/>
They've never had it like this<br/>
They don't know what it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: John Legend &amp; Teyana Taylor]</i><br/>
Pure bliss<br/>
Like you've got the key to my heart<br/>
Simple as a touch and a kiss<br/>
Never knew a feeling like this<br/>
Pure bliss, pure bliss<br/>
Nobody can tear us apart<br/>
Baby it's as good as it gets<br/>
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss)<br/>
Loving you will never be hard<br/>
This is pure bliss
