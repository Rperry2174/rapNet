<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Well<br/>
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth<br/>
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth<br/>
It is - when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound<br/>
Believe! Believe!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 4x:]</i><br/>
Lamborghini Mercy<br/>
Your chick she so thirsty<br/>
I'm in that two seat Lambo<br/>
With your girl she tryna jerk me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 — Big Sean:]</i><br/>
OK, drop it to the floor<br/>
Make that ass shake<br/>
Whoa make the ground move, that's an ass quake<br/>
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state<br/>
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray<br/>
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this err' day-day?<br/>
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day<br/>
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay<br/>
And niggas still hatin', so much hate I need an AK<br/>
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'<br/>
White girls politicin' that's that Sarah Palin<br/>
Gettin' high, Californicatin'<br/>
I give her that D, cause that's where I was born and raised in<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 — Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Yeah, it's prime time, my top back, this pimp game hoe<br/>
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James hoe<br/>
I'm bill droppin', Ms. Pacman is pill poppin' ass hoe<br/>
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins<br/>
All she want is some heel money<br/>
All she need is some bill money<br/>
He take his time, he counts it out<br/>
I weighs it up, that's real money<br/>
Check the neck, check the wrist<br/>
Them heads turnin', that's exorcist<br/>
My Audemar like Mardi Gras<br/>
That's Swiss time and that's excellence<br/>
Two door preference<br/>
Roof gone George Jefferson<br/>
That white frost on that pound cake<br/>
So your Duncan Heinz is irrelevant<br/>
Lambo, Mercy-lago, she go wherever I go<br/>
Wherever we go we do it pronto<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well it is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth<br/>
In the dance hall, and who no have teeth will run pon them gums<br/>
Caw when time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound<br/>
The bugle has blown the many times, and it still have one more time left<br/>
Caw the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 — Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Let the suicide doors up<br/>
I do suicides on the tour bus<br/>
I do suicides on the private jet<br/>
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death<br/>
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit<br/>
Tell 'em "Give me fifty million or I'm a quit"<br/>
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level<br/>
Turn up the bass 'til it's up in your face level<br/>
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid<br/>
Plus your my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious<br/>
Something' 'bout Mary she gone off that Molly<br/>
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí<br/>
Now everybody is movin' they body<br/>
Don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby<br/>
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important<br/>
You gon see lawyers and niggas in Jordans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 — 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Now catch up to my campaign<br/>
Coupe the color of mayonnaise<br/>
I'm drunk and high at the same time<br/>
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane<br/>
Spit rounds like the gun range<br/>
Beat it up like Rampage<br/>
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a band aid<br/>
Grade A, A1,<br/>
Chain the color of Akon<br/>
Black diamonds backpack around me<br/>
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton<br/>
Horse power, horse power<br/>
All this Polo on I got horse power<br/>
Pound of this cost 4 thousand<br/>
I make it rain, she want more showers<br/>
Rain pourin',<br/>
All my cars is foreign<br/>
All my broads is foreign,<br/>
Money tall like Jordan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x:]</i><br/>

<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)<br/>
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)<br/>

Believe! Believe! (swerve)
