In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told<br/>
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul<br/>
To a woman so heartless <br/>
How could you be so heartless <br/>
Oh, how could you be so heartless?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
How could you be so cold<br/>
As the winter wind when it breeze yo<br/>
Just remember that you talking to me though<br/>
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo<br/>
I mean after all the things that we been through<br/>
I mean after all the things we got into<br/>
Ayo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me<br/>
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me<br/>
And now you wanna get me back and you gonna show me<br/>
So you walk around like you don't know me<br/>
You got a new friend, well, I got homies<br/>
But in the end it's still so lonely<br/>
<br/>
In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told<br/>
Somewhere far along this road,<br/>
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless <br/>
How could you be so heartless <br/>
Oh, how could you be so heartless?<br/>
<br/>
How could you be so Dr. Evil?<br/>
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know<br/>
I decided we weren't gonna speak so<br/>
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?<br/>
Why would she be so mad at me for?<br/>
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold<br/>
I won't stop won't mess my groove up<br/>
Cause I already know how this thing go<br/>
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me<br/>
They say that they don't see what you see in me<br/>
You wait a couple months then you gonna see<br/>
You'll never find nobody better than me<br/>
<br/>
In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told<br/>
Somewhere far along this road<br/>
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless <br/>
How could you be so heartless <br/>
Oh, how could you be so heartless?<br/>
<br/>
Talking talking talking talk<br/>
Baby, let's just knock it off<br/>
They don't know what we been through<br/>
They don't know about me and you<br/>
So why I got something new to see?<br/>
And you just gon' keep hating me<br/>
And we just gon' be enemies<br/>
<br/>
I know you can't believe<br/>
I could just leave it wrong<br/>
And you can't make it right<br/>
I'm gon' take off tonight <br/>
Into the night<br/>
<br/>
In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told<br/>
Somewhere far along this road<br/>
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless <br/>
How could you be so heartless <br/>
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
