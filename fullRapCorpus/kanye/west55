<i>[Bridge - Mos Def]</i> <br/>
I'm not sure anymore-more <br/>
Who is knocking at my door-door <br/>
All the faces that I know <br/>
Ja make them so sunny and true <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mos Def]</i> <br/>
I don't wanna say goodbye to you <br/>
So I'll just say good night to you <br/>
My people, no goodbyes to you <br/>
I'm just gonna say good night <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Kanye West]</i> <br/>
Right now I can see it so vivid <br/>
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it <br/>
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip <br/>
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits <br/>
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that <br/>
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph <br/>
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh <br/>
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass <br/>
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin' <br/>
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin' <br/>
What do it mean when you never dream at all then <br/>
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them <br/>
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to <br/>
People you never got a chance to say bye to <br/>
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams <br/>
Into real life, if you try to <br/>
So close, but so far <br/>
And so far, no cigar <br/>
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today <br/>
So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow <br/>
No goodbye <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mos Def]</i> <br/>
I don't wanna say goodbye to you <br/>
So I'll just say good night to you <br/>
My people, no goodbyes to you <br/>
I'm just gonna say good night <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Al Be]</i> <br/>
Uhh, to you <br/>
If I part my heart will live through you <br/>
Dream beautiful and unusual <br/>
Wake up like everyday new to you <br/>
Stay true to you, a hood musical <br/>
My art will live through you <br/>
Dream beautiful and unusual <br/>
Wake up like everyday new to you <br/>
Stay true to you, a hood musical <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mos Def]</i> <br/>
I don't wanna say goodbye to you <br/>
So I'll just say good night to you <br/>
My people, no goodbyes to you <br/>
I'm just gonna say good night <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Mos Def x3]</i><br/>
I'm not sure anymore-more <br/>
Who is knocking at my door-door <br/>
All the faces that I know <br/>
Ja make them so sunny and true
