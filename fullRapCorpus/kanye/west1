<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
And all my people thats drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high<br/>
We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive<br/>
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
If this is your first time hearing this <br/>
You are about to experience something cold man<br/>
We never had nothing handed took nothing for granted<br/>
Took nothing from no man, man i'm my own man<br/>
But as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman<br/>
Only adult man i knew that wasnt a broke man<br/>
Flickin starter coats man, Man you ount no man<br/>
We don't care what people say<br/>
This is for my niggas outside all winter<br/>
Cuz this summer they aint finna to say next summer im finna<br/>
Sittin in the hood like community colleges<br/>
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship<br/>
Cause aint no to tuition for havin no ambition<br/>
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home<br/>
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job<br/>
You gotta do something man your ass is grown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high<br/>
<br/>
Kids Sing Kids Sing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye and Kids:]</i><br/>
We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive<br/>
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
The second verse is for my dogs working 9 to 5<br/>
That still hustle cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55<br/>
And everybody selling make-up, Jacobs<br/>
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up<br/>
We put shit on layaway then come back<br/>
We claim other people kids on our income tax<br/>
We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid<br/>
And we don't care what people say<br/>
Momma say she wanna move south <br/>
Scratchin lottery tickets Eyes on a new house<br/>
Around the same time Doe ran up in dudes house <br/>
Couldnt get a job<br/>
So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work<br/>
The drug game bolemic its hard to get weight<br/>
So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight<br/>
So we gon keep baking to the day we get cake.<br/>
And we dont care what people say <br/>
My Niggas <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye West and Kids:]</i><br/>
Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high<br/>
<br/>
Kids Sing Kids Sing<br/>
<br/>
We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive<br/>
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
You know the kids gonna act a fool<br/>
When you stop the programs for after school<br/>
And they DCFS them some of them dislecsic<br/>
They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions<br/>
We scream, rock, blows, weed park <br/>
so now we smart<br/>
We aint retards the way teachers thought<br/>
Hold up hold fast we make mo'cash<br/>
Now tell my momma i belong in the slow class <br/>
It's bad enough we on welfare<br/>
You trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair<br/>
Im trying to get the car with the chromy wheels here<br/>
You tryin to cut our lights like we dont live here<br/>
Look at whats handed us our fatheres abandoned us<br/>
When we get the hammers gone and call the ambulance<br/>
Sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us<br/>
But we dont care what people say<br/>
My Niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye West and Kids:]</i><br/>
drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high<br/>
<br/>
Kids Sing Kids Sing<br/>
<br/>
We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive<br/>
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say
