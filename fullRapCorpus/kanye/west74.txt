<i>[Bon Iver:]</i><br/>
I shoot the lights out<br/>
Hide 'til it's bright out<br/>
Whoa, just another lonely night<br/>
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm a monster no good blood sucker<br/>
Fat motherfucker now look who's in trouble<br/>
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles<br/>
Kanye West sample, here's one for example<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Gossip gossip<br/>
Nigga just stop it<br/>
Everybody know (I'm a motherfucking monster)<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
Profit profit, nigga I get it<br/>
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands...<br/>
<br/>
The best living or dead hands down huh?<br/>
Less talk more head right now huh?<br/>
And my eyes more red than the devil is<br/>
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch<br/>
None of who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this<br/>
Do the rap and attract triple double no assist<br/>
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit<br/>
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit<br/>
I heard the people saying raps are getting trap mayne<br/>
Bought the chain that always give me back pain<br/>
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane<br/>
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent<br/>
She came up to me and said this the number 2 gal<br/>
If you wanna make it number one you're number 2 now<br/>
This that goose and Malibu I call it Malibooya<br/>
God damn Yeezy how we hit em with the new style<br/>
Know that motherfucker well, what you gonna do now<br/>
Whatever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now<br/>
Nah gonna do, uh it's a new now<br/>
Think you motherfucker really really need to cool down<br/>
'Cause you will never get on top of this<br/>
So mommy best advice is just to get on top of this<br/>
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh<br/>
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus<br/>
Now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus<br/>
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship<br/>
I'm living in the future so the present is my past<br/>
My presence is a present kiss my ass<br/>
<br/>

Everybody know (I'm a motherfucking monster)<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
Profit profit, nigga I get it<br/>
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong<br/>
Loch Ness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience<br/>
Question what do these things all have in common<br/>
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster<br/>
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense<br/>
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is<br/>
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen<br/>
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams<br/>
Murder murder in black convertibles<br/>
I kill a block I murder the avenues<br/>
I rape and pillage a village, women and children<br/>
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles' heel is<br/>
Love I don't get enough of it<br/>
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers<br/>
All I see is these niggas I've made millionaires<br/>
Milling about, spilling their feelings in the air<br/>
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs<br/>
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins<br/>
I smell a massacre<br/>
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>

Nigga just stop it<br/>
Everybody know (I'm a motherfucking monster)<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
Profit profit, nigga I get it<br/>
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert<br/>
I'mma need to see your fucking hands...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Pull up in the monster<br/>
Automobile gangster<br/>
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka<br/>
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, colour of Willy Wonka<br/>
You could be the King but watch the Queen conquer<br/>
OK first things first I'll eat your brains<br/>
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs<br/>
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do<br/>
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster do<br/>
Monster Giuseppe heel that's the monster shoe<br/>
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew<br/>
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face<br/>
And if I'm fake I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't<br/>
Let me get this straight wait I'm the rookie<br/>
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?<br/>
50k for a verse, no album out!<br/>
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it<br/>
Hotter than a middle eastern climate<br/>
Find it Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it<br/>
While it, Nicki on them titties when I sign it<br/>
Have these niggas so one-track minded<br/>
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K<br/>
Forget Barbie fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake<br/>
She on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake<br/>
And I'll say Bride of Chucky is child's play<br/>
Just killed another career it's a mild day<br/>
Besides 'Ye they can't stand besides me<br/>
I think me, you and Am should m√©nage Friday<br/>
Pink wig, thick ass, give em whiplash<br/>
I think big get cash make em blink fast<br/>
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for<br/>
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bon Iver:]</i><br/>
I-I crossed the line-line<br/>
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide<br/>
I-I wouldn't last these shows<br/>
So I-I am headed home<br/>
<i>[Repeated]</i>
