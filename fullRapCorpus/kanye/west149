<i>[Teyana Taylor - Chorus]</i><br/>
Christmas in Harlem<br/>
right after autumn falls<br/>
soaking it all in<br/>
then we go hit the mall<br/>
even though we ain't balling<br/>
feels like we bought it all<br/>
the mistletoe's right here<br/>
come give a kiss to Santa Claus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night<br/>

and we wiping snow up off the windshield<br/>

and I'm, so happy I'm with my baby<br/>
and we a lil late with the Christmas gifts<br/>
rushing for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy<br/>
the streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially<br/>
told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"<br/>
my only question is, "Where my presents?"<br/>
she said, "Shhh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see<br/>
well, I like the way you think, mami<br/>
now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami<br/>
got a surprise for you that ain't on your Christmas list-es<br/>
gave her the hot chocolate, she said "It's D-ricious"<br/>

Christmas in Harlem<br/>
right after autumn falls<br/>

<i>[Cyhi the Prince]</i><br/>
First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y'all<br/>
for Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs<br/>
I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph<br/>
thugs think I'm a Blood 'cause I won't take this red suit off<br/>
ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe<br/>
I let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the North Pole<br/>
her voice slow 'cause "I always got a sore throat"<br/>
okay, stop it, no more jokes<br/>
you never see me 'cause I shop when the stores close<br/>
and my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go<br/>
ha, I got nine reindeers<br/>
that's Dancer, that's Prancer on the fourth flo'<br/>
that's Comet, that's Cupid, that's Vixen<br/>
that's Donner, that's Dasher, that's Blitzen<br/>
happy kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren't Christian<br/>
everybody gets gifts as long as I'm living<br/>
so look forward to having<br/>
<br/>
