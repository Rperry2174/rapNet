<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeezy season approaching<br/>
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing<br/>
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing<br/>
The monster about to come alive again<br/>
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz<br/>
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons<br/>
Take my number and lock it in<br/>
Indian hair, no moccasins<br/>
It's too many hoes in this house of sin<br/>
Real nigga back in the house again<br/>
Black Timbs all on your couch again<br/>
Black dick all in your spouse again<br/>
And I know she like chocolate men<br/>
She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
On sight<br/>
On sight<br/>
<br/>
How much you wanna give a fuck?<br/>
Let me show you right now before you give it up<br/>
How much do I not give a fuck?<br/>
Let me show you right now before you give it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
He'll give us what we need<br/>
It may not be what we want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Baby girl tryna get a nut<br/>
And her girl tryna give it up<br/>
Chopped em both down<br/>
Don't judge 'em Joe Brown<br/>
One last announcement<br/>
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin<br/>
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain<br/>
Took her to the bleau she tried to sip the fountain<br/>
That when David Grutman kicked her out<br/>
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
On sight<br/>
On sight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Ugh, huh<br/>
Right now, right now<br/>
I need, I need<br/>
Right now
