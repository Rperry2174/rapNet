<i>[Guy:]</i> We're gonna skate to one song and one song only.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
So I ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me<br/>
first niggas gotta find me<br/>
What’s 50 grand to a muhfucka like me<br/>
Can you please remind me?<br/>
Ball so hard, this shit crazy<br/>
Y’all don’t know that don’t shit phase me<br/>
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy<br/>
Ball so hard, this shit weird<br/>
We ain’t even supposed to be here,<br/>
Ball so hard, since we here<br/>
It’s only right that we be fair<br/>
Psycho, I’m liable to go Michael<br/>
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6<br/>
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don’t tick tock<br/>
Audemars that’s losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks<br/>
Ball so hard, I’m shocked too,<br/>
I’m supposed to be locked up too<br/>
you escaped what I’ve escaped<br/>
You’d be in Paris getting fucked up too<br/>
Ball so hard, let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days<br/>
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s<br/>
So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye,<br/>
Chi towns D. Rose, I’m movin’ the Nets to BK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me<br/>
That shit cray <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?<br/>
I said look you need to crawl ‘fore you ball<br/>
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall<br/>
And show me why you deserve to have it all<br/>
Ball so hard<br/>
That shit cray (that shit cray), ain’t it Jay?<br/>
Ball so hard<br/>
What she order (what she order), fish filet<br/>
Ball so hard<br/>
Your whip so cold (whip so cold), this old thing<br/>
Ball so hard<br/>
Act like you’ll never be around motherfuckers like this again<br/>
Bougie girl, grab her hand<br/>
Fuck that bitch she don’t wanna dance<br/>
Excuse my French but I’m in France (I’m just sayin’)<br/>
Prince William’s ain’t do it right if you ask me<br/>
Cause I was him I would have married Kate &amp; Ashley<br/>
What's Gucci my nigga?<br/>
What's Louis my killa?<br/>
What's drugs my deala?<br/>
What's that jacket, Margiela?<br/>
Doctors say I’m the illest<br/>
Cause I’m suffering from realness<br/>
Got my niggas in Paris<br/>
And they going gorillas, huh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[(Chazz) &amp; Jimmy]</i><br/>
I don't even know what that means.<br/>
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)<br/>
No, it's not, it's gross<br/>
(It gets the people going!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me<br/>
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
You are now watching the throne<br/>
Don’t let me get in my zone <i>[3x]</i><br/>
These other niggas is lyin’<br/>
Actin’ like the summer ain’t mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got that hot bitch in my home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
You know how many hot bitches I own?<br/>
Don’t let me get in my zone <i>[4x]</i><br/>
The stars is in the building<br/>
They hands is to the ceiling<br/>
I know I’m bout to kill it<br/>
How you know, I got that feeling<br/>
You are now watching the throne<br/>
Don’t let me into my zone <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z &amp; Kanye West]</i><br/>
I’m definitely in my zone
