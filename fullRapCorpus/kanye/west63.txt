<i>[Intro: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Why are you so paranoid<br/>
Don't be so paranoid<br/>
Don't be so....<br/>
Baby don't worry about it<br/>
Lady don't even think about it<br/>
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things<br/>
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things<br/>
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things<br/>
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Tell me right now<br/>
You really wanna spend your whole life alone<br/>
A little time out might do you good, might do us good<br/>
Before we be done for good<br/>
Cause I make it good I could make it hood<br/>
I can make you come I can make you go<br/>
I can make you high I can make you fly<br/>
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so<br/>
All of the time<br/>
You be up in mine checking through my cell phone baby no<br/>
You wanna kill the vibe on another night<br/>
Here's another fight oh here we go<br/>
Baby don't worry about it<br/>
Lady we'll go out to the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Anyway they don't know you like I do<br/>
They'll never know you<br/>
Anyway they don't know you like I do<br/>
They'll never know you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
All of the time<br/>
You wanna complain about the nights alone<br/>
So now you're here with me<br/>
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home<br/>
Yea you see em look<br/>
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold<br/>
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth<br/>
Don't worry about what we can't control<br/>
All the talk in the world lost in the world<br/>
Till you finally let that thing go<br/>
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel<br/>
But sorry we're closed<br/>
Baby don't worry about it<br/>
Lady we'll go out to the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Anyway they don't know you like I do<br/>
They'll never know you<br/>
Anyway they don't know you like I do<br/>
They'll never know you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Baby don't worry about it<br/>
Lady don't even think about it<br/>
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong thing<br/>
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing<br/>
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing<br/>
You worry bout the wrong thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Anyway they don't know you like I do<br/>
They'll never know you<br/>
Anyway they don't know you like I do<br/>
They'll never know you
