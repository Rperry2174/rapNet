<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to<br/>
What I had to do, had to run from you<br/>
I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong<br/>
And that haunted me, all the way home<br/>
So you never know, never never know,<br/>
Never know enough, 'til it's over love<br/>
'Til we lose control, system overload<br/>
Screamin' "No! No! No! N-No!"<br/>
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to<br/>
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you<br/>
So I keep it low, keep a secret code<br/>
So everybody else don't have to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
So keep your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Keepin' your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Now keep your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Now keep your love locked down<br/>
You lose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to<br/>
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true<br/>
I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move<br/>
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too<br/>
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own<br/>
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone<br/>
How many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through<br/>
You lose, you lose<br/>
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to<br/>
See I had to go, see I had to move<br/>
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life<br/>
We're just wastin' time, where's the finish line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
So keep your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Keepin' your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Now keep your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Now keep your love locked down<br/>
You lose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to<br/>
I bet no one knew, I got no one new<br/>
I know I said I'm through, but got love for you<br/>
But I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to<br/>
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'<br/>
Keep it on a roll, only God knows<br/>
If I be with you, baby I'm confused<br/>
You choose, you choose<br/>
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to<br/>
Where I wanna go, I don't need you<br/>
I've been down this road, too many times before<br/>
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
So keep your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Keepin' your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Now keep your love locked down<br/>
Your love locked down<br/>
Now keep your love locked down<br/>
You lose, you lose<br/>
You lose, you lose<br/>
You lose
