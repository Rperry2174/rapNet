<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Drive slow homey<br/>
Drive slow homey<br/>
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey<br/>
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye:]</i><br/>
My homey Mali used to stay one 79th and May<br/>
One of my best friends from back in the day<br/>
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones<br/>
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone<br/>
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off<br/>
Walk around the mall with his radio face off<br/>
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand<br/>
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man<br/>
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's<br/>
Drove by the teachers even more by police's<br/>
How he get that cash today his father passed away<br/>
Left him with a little something 16 he was stunting<br/>
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy<br/>
Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy<br/>
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80<br/>
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby<br/>
See back back then then if you had a car<br/>
You were the Chi town version of Baby<br/>
And I was just a virgin a baby<br/>
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy<br/>
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked<br/>
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked<br/>
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall<br/>
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all<br/>
With the girls a lot of flirting involved<br/>
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws<br/>
So put me on with these hoes homey's<br/>
He told me don't rush to get grown drive slow homey<br/>
Drive slow homie<br/>
Drive slow...<br/>
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey<br/>
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul Wall:]</i><br/>
What It do<br/>
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'<br/>
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing<br/>
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac<br/>
Trunk open, screen's on, neon's lit with fifth relax<br/>
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies<br/>
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes<br/>
It's a star-studded event when I valet park<br/>
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark<br/>
You see them 4's crawling, you see them screens falling<br/>
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm balling<br/>
I'm leaning on a switch sitting crooked in my slab<br/>
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab<br/>
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla<br/>
Riding some candy coated crawling like a caterpillar<br/>
I'm tipping on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw<br/>
I'm looking for them hoes baby what it do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Drive slow homey<br/>
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes<br/>
Drive slow homey<br/>
If you riding around the city with nowhere to go<br/>
Drive slow homey<br/>
Live today cause tomorrow man you never know<br/>
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey<br/>
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye:]</i><br/>
My cars like the movies my cars like the crib<br/>
I got more TV's in here then where I live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[GLC:]</i><br/>
And it don't make no sense but baby I'm the shit<br/>
And everything I flip you know is something serious<br/>
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims<br/>
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident<br/>
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced<br/>
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit<br/>
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain<br/>
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings<br/>
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king<br/>
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green<br/>
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues<br/>
My cylinder quiet like tip toes<br/>
I sold O's and this I know<br/>
When you see them hoes little homey drive slow<br/>
<br/>
Chopped and Screwed<br/>
Yeah..<br/>
Drive slow homey<br/>
Drive slow homey<br/>
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey<br/>
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey<br/>
Drive slow homey
