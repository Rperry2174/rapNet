I just wanna clear my mind now<br/>
It's been racin' since the summertime<br/>
And I'm holdin' down the summer now<br/>
And all I want is what I can't buy now<br/>
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now<br/>
And I told you to wait<br/>
Yeah I told you to wait<br/>
So I'm a need a little more time now<br/>
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now<br/>
And I thought you could wait<br/>
Yeah, I thought you could wait<br/>
These bitches surroundin' me<br/>
All want somethin' out me<br/>
Then they talk about me<br/>
Would be lost without me<br/>
We could've been somebody<br/>
Thought you'd be different 'bout it<br/>
Now I know you naughty<br/>
So let's get on with it<br/>
<br/>
You could've been somebody<br/>
'Stead you had to tell somebody<br/>
Let's take it back to the first party<br/>
When you tried your first molly<br/>
And came out of your body<br/>
And came out of your body<br/>
Running naked down the lobby<br/>
And you was screamin' that you love me<br/>
Before the limelight tore ya<br/>
Before the limelight stole ya<br/>
Remember we were so young<br/>
When I would hold you<br/>
Before the glory<br/>
I know there ain't wrong with me<br/>
<br/>
Something strange is happening<br/>
<br/>
You could've been somethin'<br/>
We could've, we could've been somebody<br/>
Or was it all our first party<br/>
When we tried our first molly<br/>
And came out of our body<br/>
And came out of our body<br/>
<br/>
Before they call lawyers<br/>
Before you tried to destroy us<br/>
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?<br/>
It's like I don't even know ya<br/>
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia<br/>
<br/>
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas<br/>
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas<br/>
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas<br/>
I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my...<br/>
<br/>
To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby<br/>
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy<br/>
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z<br/>
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy<br/>
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"<br/>
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"<br/>
He only wanna see that ass in reverse<br/>
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse<br/>
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side<br/>
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid<br/>
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died<br/>
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that<br/>
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that<br/>
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that<br/>
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that<br/>
That going to that owing money that the court got<br/>
On and on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie<br/>
'Til death but do your part, unholy matrimony
