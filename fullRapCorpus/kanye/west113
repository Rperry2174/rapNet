<i>[Intro: Capleton]</i><br/>

Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I am a god<br/>
I am a god<br/>
I am a god<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I am a god<br/>
Hurry up with my damn massage<br/>
Hurry up with my damn m√©nage<br/>
Get the Porsche out the damn garage<br/>
I am a god<br/>
Even though I'm a man of god<br/>
My whole life in the hands of god<br/>
So y'all better quit playing with god<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you<br/>
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you<br/>
The only rapper compared to Michael<br/>
So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you<br/>
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you<br/>
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do<br/>
Old niggas mentally still in high school<br/>
Since the tight jeans they never liked you<br/>
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack<br/>
But everybody know you brought real rap back<br/>
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack<br/>
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback<br/>
Ivan, diamond, Chi-town shining<br/>
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate<br/>
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in<br/>
Until the day I get struck by lightning<br/>
<br/>
I am a god<br/>
So hurry up with my damn massage<br/>
In a French-ass restaurant<br/>
Hurry up with my damn croissants<br/>
I am a god<br/>
I am a god<br/>
I am a god<br/>
<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I just talked to Jesus<br/>
He said, "What up Yeezus?"<br/>
I said, "Shit I'm chilling<br/>
Trying to stack these millions."<br/>
I know he the most high<br/>
But I am a close high<br/>
Mi casa, su casa<br/>
That's that cosa nostra<br/>
I am a god<br/>
I am a god<br/>
I am a god<br/>
<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Justin Vernon]</i><br/>
Ain't no way I'm giving up. I'm a god
