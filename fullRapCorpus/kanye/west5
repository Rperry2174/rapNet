<i>[Hook: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Man, man, man<br/>
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him<br/>
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up<br/>
Let's go back, back to the Gap<br/>
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch<br/>
So if I stole, wasn't my fault<br/>
Yeah I stole, never got caught<br/>
They take me to the back and pat me<br/>
Askin' me about some khakis<br/>
But let some black people walk in<br/>
I bet they show off their token blackie<br/>
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store<br/>
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Mall'<br/>
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits<br/>
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind<br/>
This fuckin' job can't help him<br/>
So I quit, y'all welcome<br/>
Y'all don't know my struggle<br/>
Y'all can't match my hustle<br/>
You can't catch my hustle<br/>
You can't fathom my love dude<br/>
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers<br/>
That's a different world like Kree Summers<br/>
I deserve to do these numbers<br/>
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach<br/>
So many records in my basement<br/>
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: GLC]</i><br/>
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky<br/>
Let's go, yeah<br/>
And I didn't even try to work a job<br/>
Represent the mob<br/>
At the same time thirsty on the grind<br/>
Chi state of mind<br/>
Lost my momma, lost my mind<br/>
+My life, my love+ that's not mine<br/>
Why you ain't signed?<br/>
Wasn't my time<br/>
Leave me alone, work for y'all<br/>
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine<br/>
Only one to ball<br/>
Never one to fall<br/>
Gotta get mine<br/>
Gotta take mine<br/>
Got a tech nine<br/>
Reach my prime<br/>
Gotta make these haters respect mine<br/>
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule said nine<br/>
Puttin' them pants on shelves<br/>
Waitin' paitently I ask myself<br/>
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be<br/>
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets<br/>
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat<br/>
Put me on my feet<br/>
Sound so sweet<br/>
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee<br/>
Stayin' low key, nope<br/>
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"<br/>
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G<br/>
Love my G, Rolly G<br/>
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's<br/>
Got a lot of people countin' on me<br/>
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace<br/>
Should of finished school like my niece<br/>
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow<br/>
Aw man, all this pressure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Consequence]</i><br/>
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab<br/>
Comin' home real late at night<br/>
Standin' on my feet all damn day<br/>
Tryin' to make this thing right<br/>
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like<br/>
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"<br/>
Well easy come, easy go<br/>
How that sayin' goes<br/>
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows<br/>
I all had that snatched from me<br/>
And all the faculties all turn their back on me<br/>
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me<br/>
So naturally actually had to face things factually<br/>
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me<br/>
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair<br/>
I don't wanna ever go back there<br/>
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit<br/>
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: GLC]</i><br/>
I wanna fly, I wanna fly<br/>
I said I want my chariot to pick me up<br/>
And take me brother for a ride
