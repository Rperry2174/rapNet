<i>[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]</i><br/>
The storm is on the horizon<br/>
I'm standing here alone<br/>
Got a pistol on my hip<br/>
And it's gonna be some shit<br/>
If you want it then bring it on<br/>
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier<br/>
And I'ma be here till it's done<br/>
And when they asking who I'm is, shit<br/>
You just tell them that I'm the one<br/>
(One, one, one)<br/>
Tell them that I'm the one<br/>
(One, one, one)<br/>
Tell them that I'm the one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I'm the one, baby<br/>
Yeah, I'm the one, baby<br/>
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby<br/>
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately<br/>
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby<br/>
You on a run, baby<br/>
You on a run, baby<br/>
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby<br/>
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?<br/>
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby<br/>
We on a galaxy that haters cannot visit<br/>
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick<br/>
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt<br/>
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps<br/>
Yeah, had to take it to another realm<br/>
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed<br/>
Best way to describe my position is at the helm<br/>
Best way to describe my new whip - Yeeeaaaalmmp<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I told Detroit I'ma fuckin' get it<br/>
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'<br/>
Ye told me I'm the man for the job<br/>
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'<br/>
Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive<br/>
I'm on HBO with my Entourage<br/>
I'm 5'9" fuck a 9 to 5<br/>
I need a hundred million no compromise<br/>
I'm a double XL nigga<br/>
Magazine and condom size<br/>
See what I seen and be traumatized<br/>
I don't wait, I marinate, variate erryday<br/>
Erry state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade<br/>
My weed loud I need a hearing aid<br/>
Livin' life behind a pair of shades<br/>
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar<br/>
For all the bullshit that I hear a day<br/>
I did it<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Treat the back seat like a sofa bed<br/>
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit share<br/>
This some good shit, but it get better<br/>
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater<br/>
Like my verse suede and the beat leather<br/>
Just tryin' to stay above sea level<br/>
When my nigga went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"<br/>
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci<br/>
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags<br/>
I shouldn't have bought it all<br/>
I should've went and cut the grass<br/>
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face<br/>
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face<br/>
Yeah I run this place, this is cash mill swag<br/>
niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast<br/>
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game<br/>
Louie's on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: James Fauntleroy (x2)]</i><br/>
fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some of my mind<br/>
And then I found weed was really kind of awesome<br/>
It's possible, goddamn right<br/>
I've been honest the whole time
