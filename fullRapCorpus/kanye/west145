<i>[Intro - Miley Cyrus:]</i><br/>
Welcome to your life<br/>
Diamond through the light<br/>
This Miami vice<br/>
It's that life okay, okay<br/>
Dodging bullets in the air when okay, okay<br/>
There's cameras everywhere and okay, okay<br/>
You don't know how to act right<br/>
Everybody wants to rule the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
For my theme song black<br/>
My leather black jeans on black<br/>
My by any means on<br/>
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on<br/>
Enter the kingdom black<br/>
But watch who you bring home<br/>
They see a black man with a white woman skrrt<br/>
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong<br/>
Middle America packed in black<br/>
Came to see me in my black skin black<br/>
Number one question they're asking straight up!<br/>
Fuck every question you asking black<br/>
If I don't get ran out by Catholics black<br/>
Here come some conservative Baptists<br/>
Claiming I'm overreacting<br/>
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Miley Cyrus:]</i><br/>
Acting on your worst behavior<br/>
Turn your back on all your haters<br/>
Everybody wants to rule the<br/>
Everybody wants to rule the world straight up!<br/>
The world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
But there's nowhere to go now<br/>
And there's no way to slow down<br/>
If I knew what I knew in the past<br/>
I would've been blacked out on your ass<br/>
Everybody<br/>
Everybody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning<br/>
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen<br/>
I keep it 300, like the Romans<br/>
300 bitches, where the Trojans?<br/>
Baby, we living in the moment<br/>
I've been a menace for the longest<br/>
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted<br/>
And you know it, and you know it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Stop all that coon shit<br/>
Early morning cartoon shit<br/>
This is that goon shit<br/>
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit<br/>
I'm aware I'm a wolf<br/>
Soon as the moon hit<br/>
I'm aware I'm a king<br/>
Back out the tomb bitch<br/>
Black out the room, bitch<br/>
Stop all that coon shit<br/>
These niggas ain't doing shit<br/>
Them niggas ain't doing shit<br/>
Come on homie what happened<br/>
You niggas ain't breathing, you gasping<br/>
These niggas ain't ready for action, action<br/>
Ready, ready for action<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
So follow me up cause this shit bout to go down<br/>
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now<br/>
But there's nowhere to go now<br/>
And there's no way to slow down<br/>
If I knew what I knew in the past<br/>
I would've been blacked out on your ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Everybody wanna move it<br/>
Get inside it, why they do it<br/>
Everybody, ride a little bit<br/>
Everybody, body do it<br/>
Do it<br/>
Do it
