<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye (Female Voice)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?<br/>
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would<br/>
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could<br/>
But (You make me smile)<br/>
<br/>
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?<br/>
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three<br/>
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us<br/>
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs<br/>
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious<br/>
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush<br/>
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous<br/>
Roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, then I'm co coming over<br/>
Cuz its ne-never over<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good<br/>
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would<br/>
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could<br/>
But (You make me smile)<br/>
<br/>
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show<br/>
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow<br/>
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go<br/>
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed<br/>
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose<br/>
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose<br/>
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed<br/>
Roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, and I keep co coming over<br/>
Cuz its ne-never over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Female Voice (Female Voice)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good<br/>
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would<br/>
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could<br/>
But... (You Make Me Smile)<br/>
<br/>
(You make me smile with my heart)<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye (Female Voice)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good<br/>
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would<br/>
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could<br/>
But... (You make me smile, With my heart)<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to ask you<br/>
Just wanted to um<br/>
Let how would I put this uhh<br/>
Let's say all your friends<br/>
Remember the one<br/>
You said if you ever she would be the one<br/>
Ok, Ok, Ok (You make me smile with my heart)<br/>
I was thinking, hypothetically<br/>
I mean don't take this seriously<br/>
Don't take me: I mean just<br/>
Uhh not credibly<br/>
I'm feeling incredibly<br/>
I mean let it be<br/>
Just let it be<br/>
I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)<br/>
I mean you, her and me<br/>
Maybe, Baby, Baby<br/>
You know I was just kidding<br/>
Unless you gon' do it<br/>

(You make me smile...)
