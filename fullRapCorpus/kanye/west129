I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye<br/>
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye<br/>
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye<br/>
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye<br/>
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye<br/>
I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye<br/>
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes<br/>
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes<br/>
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye<br/>
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye<br/>
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?<br/>
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that'd be so Kanye<br/>
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye<br/>
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
