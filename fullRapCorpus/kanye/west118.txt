<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I need to call it off, I need to make it known<br/>
'Nother one, something gone, Capricorn<br/>
Dancing out on the lawn, fancy like the things she likes<br/>
She lives her life, I'm living mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan<br/>
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray<br/>
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan<br/>
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Maybe it's cause she into Leos<br/>
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio<br/>
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold<br/>
Better bring your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole<br/>
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now<br/>
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down<br/>
Blocka-blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka<br/>
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka<br/>
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted<br/>
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka<br/>
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba<br/>
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa<br/>
On to the next saga<br/>
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her<br/>
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca<br/>
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Popcaan]</i><br/>
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan<br/>
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop, chop chop<br/>
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan<br/>
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray<br/>
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray<br/>
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
In my mind, in my, in my mind<br/>
In my mind, mind, mind, mind<br/>
In my mind, in my, in my mind<br/>
In my mind, mind, mind, mind<br/>
In my mind, in my, in my mind<br/>
Mind, mind, mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Kid Cudi]</i><br/>
Ohh<br/>
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?<br/>
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?<br/>
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?<br/>
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go<br/>
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?<br/>
Let me go, let me go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
In my mind, in my, in my mind<br/>
In my mind, mind, mind, mind<br/>
In my mind, in my, in my mind<br/>
In my mind, mind, mind, mind<br/>
In my mind, in my, in my mind<br/>
Mind, mind, mind
