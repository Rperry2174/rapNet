Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.<br/>
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.<br/>
My M-m-m-m Mama<br/>
<br/>
I Wanna Scream So Loud For You, Cuz I’m So Proud Of You An A<br/>
Let Me Tell You What I’m About To Do<br/>
Mama, You Know I Act A Fool But, I Promise You I’m Goin Back To School An<br/>
I Appreciate What You Allowed For Me, An A<br/>
<br/>
I Was Three Years Old, When You And I Moved To The Chi<br/>
Late December, Harsh Winter Gave Me A Cold<br/>
You Fixed Me Up Something That Was Good For My Soul<br/>
Famous Homemade Chicken Soup, Can I Have Another Bowl?<br/>
You Work Late Nights Just To Keep On The Lights<br/>
Mommy Got Me Training Wheels So I Could Keep On My Bike<br/>
And You Would Give Anything In This World<br/>
Michael Jackson Leather And A Glove, But Didn’t Give Me A Curl<br/>
And You Never Put No Man Over Me<br/>
And I Love You For That Mommy Cant You See?<br/>
Seven Years Old, Caught You With Tears In Your Eyes<br/>
<br/>
Cuz Somebody Cheatin, Telling You Lies, Then I Started To Cry<br/>
As We Knelt On The Kitchen Floor<br/>
I Said Mommy Imma Love You Till You Don’t Hurt No More<br/>
And When I’m Older, You Ain't Gotta Work No More<br/>
And Imma Get You That Mansion That We Couldn’t Afford<br/>
See You’re, Unbreakable, Unmistakable<br/>
Highly Capable, Lady That’s Makin Loot<br/>
A Livin Legend Too, Just Look At What Heaven Do<br/>
Send Us An Angel, And I Thank You<br/>
<br/>
Mama, I Wanna Scream So Loud For You, Cuz I’m So Proud Of You An A<br/>
Let Me Tell You What I’m About To Do<br/>
Mama, You Know I Love You So An,<br/>
I Never Let You Go An I Wrote This Song Just So You Know No Matter When You Go<br/>
<br/>
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.<br/>
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.<br/>
Last Night I Saw You In My Dreams, Now I Can't Wait To Go To Sleep.<br/>
<br/>
This Life, Is All A Dream, An My Real Life Starts When I Go To Sleep.<br/>
My M-m-m-m Mama
