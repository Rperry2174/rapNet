<i>[Nina Simone:]</i><br/>
Man I can understand how it might be<br/>
Kinda hard to love a girl like me<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West (Young Thug):]</i><br/>
For my southside niggas that know me best<br/>
I feel like Taylor Swift still owe me sex<br/>
Why, I made that bitch famous (Swea)<br/>
I made that bitch famous (I made her famous)<br/>
For my Chitown niggas that know me best<br/>
I feel like Amber Rose still owe me sex (Chiraq)<br/>
Why? I made that bitch famous<br/>
Not really, but somewhat famous (err, kinda)<br/>
All I do is get tattoos and read French Vague<br/>
Every bitch in the spot wanna drink my Ragu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Who am I remind you? (What?)<br/>
But tell me, who am I to remind you? (Who am I?)<br/>
And did you know that the country, Switzerland<br/>
It was famous for lakes?<br/>
And I think I got my ring from there 'cause it's icy like skates<br/>
Nigga, icy like hockey<br/>
Cold like a dead body, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nina Simone &amp; Young Thug:]</i><br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
I've loved you better than your own kin did<br/>
From the very start (Oh yeah)<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Nike slave, fit in your place<br/>
Don't come out your face<br/>
Don't come out your mouth<br/>
Don't come out your house<br/>
Don't come out the blah<br/>
It came out the North, it came out the South<br/>
The tally is down<br/>
Bumpin' the...<br/>
The hate is anony...<br/>
The copacabana...<br/>
It made me...<br/>
Someone told me...<br/>
The world turnin' Black slowly<br/>
Where you can call niggas "niggas"<br/>
But you better not mention Hitler<br/>
So tell me who run the label, where the guns from? Us<br/>
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us<br/>
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us<br/>
US!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nina Simone &amp; Young Thug:]</i><br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
I've loved you better than your own kin did<br/>
From the very start<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
Free like a bird<br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
Know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
One more time for the Chi-Town<br/>
One more time for the A-Town<br/>
I bet that money come around if you stay down<br/>
I swear, I just came from Europe, my money colored like a clown<br/>
Nigga play with keys, Swizz Beatz<br/>
Nigga only fuck unique freaks<br/>
Still Michael Jackson after all these leaks (what?)<br/>
Yeah bitch you're still Dirty Diana to me (woo!)<br/>
Pop a hundred bottles, I'm the shot caller (ballin'!)<br/>
Came up out a hot boy, fuck a baller blocker<br/>
Bitches makin' lots of noise like Griselda Blanco<br/>
You hit it first and bought a purse and she moved off your blocka (fool!)<br/>
Lick the molly off my hand<br/>
Smokin' loud, ambulance<br/>
And I was high as hell, I need to come down<br/>
Somebody call Tar, I need a Xan<br/>
Eat that pussy like a jelly bean<br/>
My <i>[?]</i> is bigger than a jelly bean<br/>
Got a mink on like I'm Hakeem<br/>
Got fish filet but we don't fry these<br/>
Gold card with a Trojan<br/>
Rub the bitch with the lotion<br/>
Bitch I'm ballin' like Kobe<br/>
Bitch I'm ballin' like LeBron<br/>
No, no, we don't broadcast<br/>
Pussy nigga gotta show<br/>
Monkey nigga actin' like they don't know me<br/>
But a lot of monkey niggas owe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nina Simone &amp; Young Thug:]</i><br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
I've loved you better than your own kin did<br/>
From the very start<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
I just wanted you to know
