<i>[Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
One hand in the air if you don't really care<br/>
Two hands in the air if you don't really care<br/>
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous<br/>
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous<br/>
One hand in the air if you don't really care<br/>
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care<br/>
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous<br/>
Life can be sometimes ridiculous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball<br/>
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all<br/>
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired<br/>
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call<br/>
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all<br/>
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall<br/>
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers<br/>
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers<br/>
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn<br/>
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping<br/>
That know we get O's like Cheerios<br/>
That know because they seen us in the videos<br/>
That know the day that you play me<br/>
Would be the same day MTV play videos<br/>
That was a little joke, voila<br/>
Praises due to the most high, Allah<br/>
Praises due to the most fly, Prada<br/>
Baby, I'm magic, tada<br/>
Address me as your highness, high as United<br/>
30,000 feet up and you are not invited<br/>
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work<br/>
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work<br/>
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt<br/>
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'<br/>
<br/>
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches<br/>
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous<br/>
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes<br/>
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended<br/>
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?<br/>
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall<br/>
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store<br/>
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause<br/>
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers<br/>
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero<br/>
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain<br/>
I went from the favorite to the most hated<br/>
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?<br/>
Moral victories is for minor league coaches<br/>
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches<br/>
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas<br/>
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused<br/>
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30<br/>
Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me<br/>
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?<br/>
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing<br/>
All these little bitches too big for they britches<br/>
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches<br/>
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous<br/>
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes<br/>
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Success is what you make it, take it how it come<br/>
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from<br/>
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become<br/>
CNN said I'd be dead by 21<br/>
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace<br/>
As you looking at the king in his face<br/>
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape<br/>
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith<br/>
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce<br/>
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose<br/>
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen<br/>
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't<br/>
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest<br/>
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest<br/>
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance<br/>
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness<br/>
I speak the gospel, hostile<br/>
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils<br/>
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful<br/>
Eye of the law, aspire for more<br/>
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw<br/>
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call<br/>
Flow similar to the legends of the falls<br/>
Spill it, I own you all, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
One hand in the air if you don't really care<br/>
Two hands in the air if you don't really care<br/>
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous<br/>
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous<br/>
One hand in the air if you don't really care<br/>
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care<br/>
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous<br/>
Life can be sometimes ridiculous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cyhi The Prynce:]</i><br/>
Hah, I am so outrageous<br/>
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet<br/>
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist<br/>
My phrases amazes the faces in places<br/>
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds<br/>
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it<br/>
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"<br/>
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David<br/>
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks<br/>
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks<br/>
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May<br/>
She found out about April, so she chose to march<br/>
Hah, damn another broken heart<br/>
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark<br/>
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar<br/>
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart<br/>
G-A-T in the Pathfinder<br/>
Cause you haters got PhDs<br/>
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors<br/>
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RZA:]</i><br/>
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches<br/>
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous<br/>
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress<br/>
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
One hand in the air if you don't really care<br/>
Two hands in the air if you don't really care<br/>
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous<br/>
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous<br/>
One hand in the air if you don't really care<br/>
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care<br/>
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous<br/>
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
