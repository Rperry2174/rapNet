<i>[John Legend - Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got the World in my hands, the master plan<br/>
but I don’t know why I keep calling<br/>
why I keep all of these girls at my shows<br/>
they loving me but I don’t know why<br/>
I keep calling<br/>
why I keep calling you<br/>
<br/>
All the models to the floor right now<br/>
All the models to the floor right now<br/>
All the models to the floor right now<br/>
All the models to the floor right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb<br/>
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez<br/>
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks<br/>
If you work with my people, speak that Jourdan Dunn language<br/>
Make a phone call, out to Joan Smalls<br/>
I wonder how it feel to Lara Stone’s walls<br/>
Jessica Gomes, yall, I would damage her<br/>
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina<br/>
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve<br/>
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg<br/>
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa<br/>
Alessandra Ambrosia, Anja Rubik,<br/>
get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single<br/>
Abbey Lee, too I’m a freak boo<br/>
I’m wylin I’m on a thousand<br/>
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got the World in my hands, the master plan<br/>
but I don’t know why I keep calling<br/>
why I keep all of these girls at my shows<br/>
they loving me but I don’t know why<br/>
I keep calling<br/>
why I keep calling you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Christian Dior denim flow<br/>
I told her I’m tryna eat out so what we going for dinner for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Miami nights on the search for some T and A<br/>
tryna hide what’s obvious to see in me<br/>
we conversate a bit about your DNA<br/>
and my salmon coloured suits from the VMA’s<br/>
oh you was watching, who the fuck wasn’t<br/>
me skip across that stage in 5 dozen<br/>
yeah 6 grand for a minutes time<br/>
italian vogue styled a nigga for a minute rhyme<br/>
lets be clear and lets be fair<br/>
the best things in music’s being offered here<br/>
its a round table full of bosses here<br/>
still giving you it all like the coffins near<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ryan Leslie:]</i><br/>
It’s time for a lesson in model behaviour<br/>
damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you<br/>
man I can see the flaws to your flavour<br/>
look like wonder woman and still need a saviour<br/>
maybe its a billionaire maybe its that cocaine<br/>
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game<br/>
a good girl lost in the city life<br/>
Agent Provocateur holding titties right<br/>
I’m haute couture of hoes galore<br/>
give my girl a newport ’cause she’s smoking yours<br/>
I’m the authority of model seniority<br/>
they call me Les but they all need more of me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd Banks:]</i><br/>
Handcrafted material, champagne for cereal<br/>
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm<br/>
Fly clothes and Lear shows, type kind of stuff we on<br/>
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I’m puffin’ strong<br/>
I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone<br/>
Must’ve been the liquor talkin’, I’m beggin’ the cups, “C’mon”<br/>
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form<br/>
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem<br/>
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)<br/>
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Uh)<br/>
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment<br/>
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?<br/>
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy<br/>
Now I’m back like a nine milli, runnin’ New York City<br/>
See me clearly through the storm<br/>
The world’s mine, sits pretty in my palm<br/>
Sean Don as we continue on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Niggas think they know I’m the guy with the story<br/>
they dont really know what’s in my head, fuckin’ with me<br/>
How can I be better?<br/>
I could start with just the basics<br/>
Dior, Dior, galore, I love the cut<br/>
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the nini<br/>
to the people who dont know Cud’, know what?<br/>
rose gold presidential on my boney wrist<br/>
took my ma to Chanel, had her LC the stunner<br/>
she got haters, some in the fam made us<br/>
but they don’t really matter, we escaping with our paper<br/>
“Hey ya”, I’m on my Andre 3000<br/>
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling<br/>
woke up in the room and my mojo was active<br/>
looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive<br/>
back when let me not reflect on the old shit<br/>
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script<br/>
Bitches better have they thoughts before approaching<br/>
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas<br/>
do things all before living, haters, copy, I’m the image<br/>
haters, copy, I’m the image
