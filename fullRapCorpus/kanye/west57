<i>[Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]</i><br/>
La La La La (87, 32 that's the way it go, Kanye and Jizzle say it ain't so) <br/>
Wait till I get my money right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
If I had a billion dollars (YEAHHHHHHHHHH)<br/>
Yeah, I'd spend all in a day<br/>
Show these niggas how to play (play)<br/>
Top floor penthouse I'll show 'em where i stay (stay)<br/>
Grand piano, might learn to play (Ha Ha!)<br/>
Need a hundred grand just to past me everyday (Woo! Woo!)<br/>
You know i like them white keys on it (yea!)<br/>
Duck tape when we wrap them<br/>
Call me prejudice, cuz i never touch the black ones (keys that is, Ha Ha!)<br/>
Let me show how to do this shawty (shawty)<br/>
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (DAMN!)<br/>
Patron got me so confused (fused)<br/>
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news<br/>
Fresh nine piece, yeah them wings is cajun<br/>
Never seen me in the kitchen nigga, I am amazing (nah)<br/>
Well, fuck it I'm rich then<br/>
If balling is a crime, fuck it I'm hit then<br/>
If Thugging is a term, fuck it I'm it then<br/>
The insane dough, hey, fuck it I'm sick then<br/>
Somebody call me a shrink<br/>
Until then, Ima fix me a drink (Ha Ha!)<br/>
Top down in the bit, I'm so intoxicated<br/>
Sometimes I think to myself "god damn, I made it"<br/>
And I know they hate it<br/>
On the all night flight<br/>
Tryna get my money right<br/>
Wassup?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]</i><br/>
La La La La (Hey!)<br/>
Wait till I get my money right<br/>
La La La La (Yeah!)<br/>
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?<br/>
Excuse me, is you saying something?<br/>
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (HA HA!)<br/>
You can't tell me nothing<br/>
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]</i><br/>
Yea, yea<br/>
Yea, homie this a theme song<br/>
First I get my money right<br/>
Then I get my team on<br/>
If I always pray to have gleam on<br/>
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?<br/>
And I was high as a lil jet<br/>
Fly as the insect, even though we ended<br/>
And it don't matter if I get her number cuz<br/>
When I get my money right she gon come running<br/>
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "O"<br/>
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's<br/>
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes<br/>
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes<br/>
Now my game so professional<br/>
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)<br/>
Right after the fame did you gain anything?<br/>
Damn Ye, would you change anything?<br/>
But (If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)<br/>
I'd copped more pink polos and pop those collars<br/>
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow<br/>
My Benz need company, her nickname tahoe<br/>
“Wait till i get my money” everybody motto<br/>
So Ima need a bravo for everything I wrote<br/>
Yeah, hey mama they can't hate him<br/>
Cuz after all of the drama, K slayed them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]</i><br/>
La La La La (Hey!)<br/>
Wait till I get my money right<br/>
La La La La (Yeah!)<br/>
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?<br/>
Excuse me, is you saying something?<br/>
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (HA HA!)<br/>
You can't tell me nothing<br/>
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]</i><br/>
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)<br/>
Wait till I get my money right<br/>
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)<br/>
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
