<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen <br/>
Straight up out a movie scene <br/>
Who knew she was a drama queen <br/>
That a turn my life to Stephen King <br/>
Up late night like she on patrol <br/>
Checking everything like I'm on parole <br/>
I told her some things she don't need to know <br/>
She never let it go<br/>
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok <br/>
You will never stop it now<br/>
You never stop it now <br/>
Ok, Ok, Ok <br/>
You will never stop it now <br/>
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cause I don't want no Robocop <br/>
You moving like a Robocop<br/>
When did you become a Robocop <br/>
Now I don't need no Robocop <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Just looking at your history <br/>
You like the girl from Misery <br/>
She said she ain't take it to this degree<br/>
Well let's agree to disagree <br/>
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on <br/>
Keep it up enough to keep it goin? on <br/>
I told her some things she don't need to know <br/>
She never let it go<br/>
Ok, ok, ok, ok <br/>
You will never stop it now <br/>
You never stop it now <br/>
Ok, ok, ok, ok <br/>
You will never stop it now <br/>
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cause I don't want no Robocop <br/>
You moving like a Robocop <br/>
When did you become a Robocop <br/>
Somebody please make her stop <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Stop...drop...roll...pop bitch I'm cold....I <br/>
Ain't used to being told stop <br/>
So I could never be your robot <br/>
Fast or slow you can stay or can go <br/>
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know <br/>
Yea I had her before but that happened before <br/>
You get mad when you know so just don't ask me no more <br/>
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh <br/>
It ain't ok, ok, ok<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
You spoiled little LA girl<br/>
You're just an LA girl<br/>
You spoiled little LA girl<br/>
You're just and LA girl<br/>
You spoiled little LA girl<br/>
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)<br/>
You spoiled little LA girl<br/>
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)<br/>
Oh you're kidding me<br/>
You must be joking<br/>
Or you are smoking<br/>
Oh oh you're kidding me<br/>
Oh you're kidding me<br/>
Ha ha that was a good one<br/>
Your first good one in a while<br/>
Your first good one in a while<br/>
You need to stop it now<br/>
You need to stop it now<br/>
Oh you need to stop it now
