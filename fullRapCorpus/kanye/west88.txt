<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
(Sun in the sky)<br/>
(You know how I feel)<br/>
Me and the RZA connect<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by)<br/>
Yeah, me and the RZA connect<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by)<br/>
(It’s a new life for me)<br/>
(For me, for me)<br/>
(Oooh, oooh)<br/>
(And I’m feelin’ good)<br/>
<br/>
And I’ll never let my son have an ego<br/>
He’ll be nice to everyone, wherever we go<br/>
I mean, I might even make ‘em be Republican<br/>
So everybody know he love white people<br/>
And I’ll never let ‘em leave his college girlfriend<br/>
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind<br/>
And I’ll never let ‘em ever hit the telethon<br/>
I mean even if people dyin’ and the world ends<br/>
See, I just want ‘im to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life<br/>
Just want ‘im to be someone people like<br/>
Don’t want ‘im to be hated, all the time judged<br/>
Don’t be like your daddy that would never budge<br/>
And I’ll never let ‘im ever hit a strip club<br/>
I learned the hard way, that ain’t the place to get love<br/>
And I’ll never let his mom move to L.A.<br/>
Knowin’ she couldn’t take the pressure, now we all pray<br/>
<br/>
(Sun in the sky)<br/>
(You know how I feel)<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by)<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by)<br/>
(It’s a new life for me)<br/>
Me and the RZA connect<br/>
(For me, for me)<br/>
Me and the RZA connect (Oooh, oooh)<br/>
(And I’m feelin’ good)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Sorry junior, I already ruined ya<br/>
‘Cause you ain’t even alive, paparazzi pursuin’ ya<br/>
Sins of a father make yo’ life ten times harder<br/>
I just wanna take ya to a barber<br/>
Bondin’ on charters, all the shit that I never did<br/>
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it<br/>
Took me 26 years to find my path<br/>
My only job is cuttin’ the time in half<br/>
So at 13 we’ll have our first drink together<br/>
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk<br/>
Look a man dead in his eyes<br/>
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it<br/>
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend<br/>
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him<br/>
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin’<br/>
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him<br/>
Never repeat him, never repeat him<br/>
<br/>
(Sun in the sky)<br/>
(You know how I feel)<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by)<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by)<br/>
<br/>
(It’s a new life for me)<br/>
(For me, for me)<br/>
(Oooh, oooh)<br/>
(And I’m feelin’ good)<br/>
<br/>
(Sun in the sky, you know how I feel)<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by, you know how I feel)<br/>
(Breeze driftin’ on by, you know how I feel)<br/>
(It’s a new life for me)<br/>
(It’s a new dawn, it’s a new day)<br/>
(It’s a new life for me)<br/>
(Oooh, oooh)<br/>
(And I’m feelin’…)<br/>
(Birds flyin’ high, you know how I feel)
