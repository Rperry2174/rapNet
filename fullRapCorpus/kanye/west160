<i>[CHORUS: (Keyshia Cole and Kanye West)]</i><br/>
<i>[Keyshia Cole]</i><br/>
I've been waiting my life; and I stayed on my grind<br/>
Now I made up my mind; it's been way too much time<br/>
That's why...It's just impossible - It's im-poss-ible<br/>
And you know that...<br/>
<i>[Kanye]</i><br/>
I don't wanna hear that bull sh..; I wanna hear that official sh..,<br/>
Kanye and that Twista sh..; that's so impossible to get it (it's just impossible)<br/>
Get it, that's so impossible to get it, Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
Aint no way you could pull up to the party in a Bentley blowing B in a club like this; (oh no)<br/>
Aint no way you could cook up in the studio with Kanye and get it jukking in the club like this (oh no)<br/>
Aint no way that you could win; dust some haters off while I'm sippin on my 'hen,<br/>
Holla at a chick while she sippin on her gin<br/>
And I got the mobsters hollering at her friends, (its impossible)<br/>
For you to ever be the nicest; you aint get gangsta or get righteous,<br/>
You aint neva stood on a tip like this; you aint neva stood for no sh.. like this, (Its just impossible)<br/>
For you to get it if you don't wanna win; so get up off ya ass<br/>
and go for yours<br/>
and neva for mine<br/>
now you aint from the ride that I'm in<br/>
Know what I'm<br/>
sayin...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
It's impossible for you to eva get wit me because of how I ride on the track;<br/>
Got the bitch in the back of the billy yo? When my celeb<br/>
used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac (it's just impossible)<br/>
<br/>
Niggas always hatin<br/>
leaving me for wilin out for po kim<br/>
you be sittin back talking yo shit<br/>
I cant help but I see you tho, I don't get it (Its impossible)<br/>
<br/>
Lil mama, for you to fit all that up in a pants; booty kinda wide<br/>
turn a regular jeans in a low riders<br/>
tell me can I be your man  (its just impossible)<br/>
For you to eva deny, that I'm about chi-town<br/>
represent the city with the deal for 12 years and sell a couple a mil and still hold it down...THAT'S POSSIBLE<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye]</i><br/>
Get it; bundled up and - lit it; smoke a lil blunt don't - admit it<br/>
do it like I did too late - I did it<br/>
The controversy cant worse me man; I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and<br/>
Thirsty what is you saying<br/>
I gotta a duel with a couple niggas that's Thursday man<br/>
Why the hell is i'm worrying; hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10<br/>
Man your life must be perfect man; look at how they came up with the perfect plan<br/>
Its impossible<br/>
got strip clubs playin gosspital<br/>
girl so sick in the hospital<br/>
you know I jumped out like pakadu<br/>
I only break it down I when I rock wit you<br/>
Since Michael Jackson made rock wit you<br/>
I done did shit on logical<br/>
maybe cause we did the impossible<br/>
maybe we done did the impossible<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
No matter what i do, see i been waitin all my, waitin all my life, yeah,<br/>
And i know i stayed on my grind, i know i stayed on my grind,<br/>
Its impossible for me to fail baby, i gotta keep on movin,<br/>
Gotta keep on movin, its impossible<br/>
<br/>
(Its just impossible) (its impossible)
