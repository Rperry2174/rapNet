<i>[Intro: The Dream]</i><br/>
Look at your money<br/>
Ooh momma, this could be you<br/>
On the right side of this drop<br/>
Ooh momma, throw it in reverse<br/>
I call that back it up and drop a<br/>
Baby, baby baby, baby baby<br/>
Baby, baby baby, baby baby<br/>
Baby, baby baby, baby baby<br/>
Baby, baby baby, baby baby<br/>
Oh, girl I think that she like<br/>
I got that shit that make niggas wanna fight<br/>
I got that shit that make bitches act right<br/>
Make bitches act out of spite, aiight<br/>
Oh momma, I got that bomb<br/>
I got that shit make your ass go run<br/>
My shit, not make niggas get guns<br/>
But the white girls say, "Where you get that cool beat from?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: The Dream]</i><br/>
She love it (She love it)<br/>
Every beat of the drum, she sprung<br/>
She say I make her wanna touch it<br/>
She love it (She love it)<br/>
She make me wanna touch it<br/>
I love it (I love it)<br/>
We buzzin', yeah<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Pusha T]</i><br/>
Yeah, I've been known to chase 'em<br/>
Known to replace 'em<br/>
Shoe game outta this world, I outer space 'em<br/>
Known to have a hundred and one, like Dalmatians<br/>
Maybe if she special enough, I'll glass case her<br/>
Get caught cheating and I gotta let you stick me up<br/>
Let you shop 'til you drop as a pick-me-up<br/>
Bergdorf bandit, Barnies for the burglary<br/>
But these bands lift the whole store like Hercules<br/>
Get raunchy in Givenchy, my palm reads<br/>
Passports Pinot Noir in arm's reach<br/>
Paddle shiftin', push-button, no car keys<br/>
The penthouses are poolside with palm trees<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: The Dream]</i><br/>
She love it (She love it)<br/>
Every beat of the drum, she sprung<br/>
She say I make her wanna touch it<br/>
She love it (She love it)<br/>
She make me wanna touch it<br/>
I love it (I love it)<br/>
We buzzin', yeah<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mase]</i><br/>
Uh, one-two one-two guess who back again<br/>
Uh, Harlem in this-what? Yeezy let Manhattan in<br/>
Get my mic right, turn my levels up<br/>
Get the light right, turn my bezel up<br/>
You hear the bounce on it, go and throw your mouth on it<br/>
So many ghosts in my garage they think my house haunted<br/>
Long as my buckle say Hermes, the rumors I'm not concerned with<br/>
They wanna garnish my earnings before I send it I burn it<br/>
You know them people too convinced that my money's gettin' rinsed<br/>
Her Louis seven inch, they TMZ me through my tint<br/>
I bumped into Loon he like, "Well, as-salamu alaykum"<br/>
You know I ain't Muslim my nigga, I'm about my bacon<br/>
The shot niggas takin' you'd think I'm rollin' 'round with Reagan<br/>
A Mexican landscape and come rake in what I'm makin'<br/>
Think you blew me up with your bougie butt<br/>
But you ain't slow me up, I'm on the charts, you move me up<br/>
I'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard<br/>
It's hard to believe dollar sign e-even know the Lord<br/>
Already wrote it off, so just ignore the cost<br/>
So when I'm rollin' off I'm showin' off with no remorse<br/>
Sh'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: The Dream]</i><br/>
We buzzin', yeah<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker<br/>
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Cocaine 80s]</i><br/>
bitch hold smoke longer<br/>
Choke hold so strong, broke your armor<br/>
Now you're wide open, right?<br/>
You ain't even smokin' right<br/>
bitch hold the smoke<br/>
Cough hope, Harpo<br/>
Gotcha knocked out, now you know you're smokin' loud<br/>
You're higher than a motherfucker<br/>
High in this bitch, high as a motherfucker<br/>
I'm high and this bitch fine as a motherfucker<br/>
I'm high as a motherfucker<br/>
I hear sirens, she dying in this motherfucker<br/>
Moment of silence for this motherfucker<br/>
I'm just higher than a motherfucker<br/>
I'm higher than a motherfucker<br/>
I'm higher than a mother-
