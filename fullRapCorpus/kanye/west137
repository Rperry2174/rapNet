<i>[Junie Morrison:]</i><br/>
La di da di da, da<br/>
I like this flavor<br/>
La di da di da, la<br/>
Let me tell you<br/>
I'm out here from a very far away place<br/>
All for a chance to be a star<br/>
Nowhere seems to be too far<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
No more parties in LA<br/>
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh<br/>
No more parties in LA<br/>
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh<br/>
No more (Los Angeles)<br/>
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)<br/>
Please (shake that body, party that body)<br/>
Please (shake that body, party that body)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans<br/>
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan<br/>
It was more than soft porn for the K-man<br/>
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"<br/>
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty<br/>
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie<br/>
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler<br/>
I show you the ropes, connect the dots<br/>
A country girl that love Hollywood<br/>
Mama used to cook red beans and rice<br/>
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite<br/>
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection<br/>
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians<br/>
R&amp;B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers<br/>
Music and iPhone cameras<br/>
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing<br/>
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean<br/>
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class<br/>
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag<br/>
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?<br/>
That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck<br/>
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper<br/>
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards<br/>
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence<br/>
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is<br/>
The head still good though, the head still good though<br/>
Ladies say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"<br/>
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical<br/>
Make me get spiritual<br/>
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal<br/>
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me<br/>
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday<br/>
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place<br/>
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek<br/>
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee<br/>
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets<br/>
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity<br/>
And yeah G, I was all for it<br/>
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet<br/>
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie<br/>
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Scary<br/>
Scary<br/>
No more parties in LA<br/>
Please, baby, no more parties in LA<br/>
<br/>
Friday night tryna make it into the city<br/>
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty<br/>
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place<br/>
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base<br/>
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds<br/>
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs<br/>
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous<br/>
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list<br/>
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired<br/>
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired<br/>
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired<br/>
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir<br/>
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary<br/>
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries<br/>
For all my niggas with babies by bitches<br/>
That use their kids as meal tickets<br/>
Not knowing the disconnect from the father<br/>
The next generation will be the real victims<br/>
I can't fault 'em really<br/>
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly<br/>
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'<br/>
Of weak content of slow jammin'<br/>
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'<br/>
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'<br/>
I be thinkin' every day<br/>
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades<br/>
I be paranoid every time<br/>
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'<br/>
The problem is I be textin'<br/>
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired<br/>
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died<br/>
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive<br/>
That's why I'd rather take the 405<br/>
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim<br/>
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him<br/>
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents<br/>
What I'm supposed to do?<br/>
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?<br/>
Every agent I know know I hate agents<br/>
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant<br/>
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance<br/>
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch<br/>
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans<br/>
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans<br/>
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again<br/>
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans<br/>
I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems<br/>
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I ain't never drive it<br/>
It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out<br/>
And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out<br/>
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam<br/>
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me<br/>
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!<br/>
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full<br/>
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful<br/>
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes<br/>
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news<br/>
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house<br/>
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out<br/>
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots<br/>
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop<br/>
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that<br/>
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that<br/>
She push me back when the dick go too deep<br/>
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep<br/>
Get money, money, money, money<br/>
Big, big money, money, money, money<br/>
And as far as real friends, tell my cousins I love 'em<br/>
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Larry Graham:]</i><br/>
I just keep on lovin' you, baby<br/>
And there's no one else I know who can take your place<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Please, no more parties in LA<br/>
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh<br/>
No more parties in LA<br/>
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh<br/>
No more parties in LA<br/>
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh<br/>
No more (Los Angeles)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Junie Morrison:]</i><br/>
I'm out here from a very far away place<br/>
All for a chance to be a star<br/>
Nowhere seems to be too far<br/>
