<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Just me and you girl<br/>
(Wooooah oooh)<br/>
Just me and you girl<br/>
(Wooooah oooh)<br/>
<br/>
Tryna sneak upstairs to your apartment<br/>
Aren’t you a sight for red eyes<br/>
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side<br/>
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no makeup<br/>
I’m just tryna be inside you ‘fore you wake up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Just me and you girl<br/>
(Wooooah oooh)<br/>
Just me and you girl<br/>
(Wooooah oooh)<br/>
<br/>
We have problems but thats all in the past<br/>
Everybody got problems baby I got a past<br/>
Remember I used to do things that would make you laugh<br/>
Like ordering girl drinks in a masculine glass<br/>
You like pina coladas, getting caught in the rain<br/>
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain<br/>
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains<br/>
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name<br/>
But they never let us do our thing<br/>
Everybody lying on who I bang<br/>
We was on fire but they blew our flame<br/>
Ain’t no denying baby you have changed<br/>
Cause now your high heels clicking<br/>
Your lip gloss glisten<br/>
Your hips start switching<br/>
You’re pissed off, tripping<br/>
Cause even when we’re kissing baby girl feel different<br/>
Friends all diss him like ‘no he didn’t?’<br/>
No he didn’t, is you talking about Kitten?<br/>
Is that bitch still stripping?<br/>
Tryna to get a pair of Christian’s?<br/>
I swear to God that they got you going crazy<br/>
But you play it off and say how it’s work baby<br/>
Well some of the models is too coked to walk straight<br/>
But seem to still love the man that they all hate<br/>
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always<br/>
It kept me on the phone and demanded they always<br/>
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time<br/>
Now my credit so bad I can’t get no one to co-sign<br/>
I woulda thought she woulda busted a dope crime<br/>
But she up and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign<br/>
Now she back in the club in a tight dress<br/>
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress<br/>
Seen with some lame, it’s a miracle that she’a talk to a nigga<br/>
with a ten year ago swag<br/>
Plus I don’t like none of her girlfriends<br/>
Quote unquote cause her girlfriends got girlfriends<br/>
On the phone hollin’ at niggas is watever<br/>
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever<br/>
Now she headed to Rome, Rome is the home<br/>
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone<br/>
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown<br/>
So I can’t bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned<br/>
So a nigga had to hop on a plane<br/>
A bus and a train to try and come talk and explain<br/>
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candle light dinner<br/>
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her<br/>
And told her even though I met you in a club in a tight dress<br/>
At first sight I can picture you in a white dress<br/>
30 foot train, diamond from Lorraine<br/>
Just to make up for all the years and the pain<br/>
Family on both sides I’m so glad you came<br/>
Auntie couldn’t make it, oh no, thats a shame<br/>
Wedding in June, what could be better<br/>
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever<br/>
Take the very last car of the Eurostar<br/>
Tell the conductor just drive so far<br/>
Told some of your friends and they wasn’t excited<br/>
Well we’ll go to the country side and they won’t be invited<br/>
We will not be disturbed by the fussing and fighting<br/>
Tell peaches light the herb, we just re-united, we just re-united<br/>
Lets make a move on these herds, go somewhere private<br/>
I’m talking just me and you and a plane and a pilot
