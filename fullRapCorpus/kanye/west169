Why would she make calls out the blue<br/>
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Don't say you will, unless you will<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Don't say you will, you do<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will<br/>
<br/>
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul<br/>
Take off your cool, then lose control<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Don't say you will, you will, you will<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will<br/>
<br/>
I wish this song would really come true<br/>
(I wish this song would really come true<br/>
I wish this song, this song could play and could come true<br/>
I wish this song, "Say You Will," would come true<br/>
I wish this song)<br/>
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you<br/>
(I admit I, don't say, I admit I, don't say I admit I)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
(I admit I, I admit I)<br/>
Don't say you will, you will, you will<br/>
(Say you will, say you will<br/>
Don't say I, don't say I)<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will
