<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I never liked you n-ggas<br/>
Who knew one day I'd be just like you n-ggas<br/>
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas<br/>
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas<br/>
When I become my mama's boyfriends?<br/>
When I become my mama's boyfriends?<br/>
<br/>
He walked in our lives<br/>
I was only five<br/>
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly<br/>
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize<br/>
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy<br/>
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband<br/>
I was the man of the house when there wasn't<br/>
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm<br/>
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum<br/>
We are the voices of our parents bad choices<br/>
The aftermath of divorces<br/>
The kids of bitter split ups<br/>
And baby sitters<br/>
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us<br/>
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new n-gga<br/>
You old Old Spice wearing<br/>
Short chain wearing<br/>
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing<br/>
Church sock wearing<br/>
When you first stop caring about your appearance<br/>
When you get here anyway I already got parents<br/>
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons<br/>
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance<br/>
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance<br/>
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring<br/>
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud<br/>
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud<br/>
I scream out "I ain't going to sleep no time soon,<br/>
And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room"<br/>
I don't like you n-gga<br/>
If I was old enough I would fight you n-gga<br/>
I wanna run over you in my bike you n-gga<br/>
Don't go to sleep at night you n-gga<br/>
<br/>
And it seems like I wasted time<br/>
If thats what it's all about<br/>
Mama if thats moving up than I<br/>
<br/>
When I become my mama's boyfriends<br/>
Twenty years later where has the time gone<br/>
Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own<br/>
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around<br/>
I never thought I'd ever raise another n-ggas child<br/>
He don't like his mama's boyfriend<br/>
Just like me don't wanna do the wrong thing<br/>
That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then<br/>
Cause when she here he be quiet<br/>
When she leave he be talking again<br/>
He be wylin again<br/>
Be calm I don't drink the drama<br/>
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on<br/>
You gon marry my mom look<br/>
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms<br/>
And I did take little man to church<br/>
And took little man to school<br/>
Look littl eman kids don't make the rules<br/>
Even though I aint raised you<br/>
You your mama angel<br/>
Don't get it twisted baby boy I'll Ving Rhames you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
