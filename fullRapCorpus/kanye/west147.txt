<i>[Intro - Quavo:]</i><br/>
Lifestyle on camera<br/>
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier<br/>
They tried to turn me to an animal<br/>
But white people think I'm radical<br/>
Supermodels think I'm handsome<br/>
You might think I'm too aggressive<br/>
Really I think I'm too passive<br/>
Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
1500, all in singles (straight up!)<br/>
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Pray for me<br/>
I'm about to hit the Ye button<br/>
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong<br/>
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'<br/>
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'<br/>
Wasn't nothin', you could say nothin'<br/>
I done lost and made money<br/>
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me<br/>
And I'm fresh out of debt in this motherfucker!<br/>
And they still ain't ready yet for a motherfucker!<br/>
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on<br/>
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
Fresh out the pen in this motherfucker<br/>
And they still ain't ready yet for a motherfucker<br/>
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on<br/>
Now that Gucci's home, it's over for you Gucci clones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
1500, all in singles (straight up!)<br/>
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
Champions, we run the city<br/>
Number one, they fallin' from the top<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Look, I say a prayer for my enemies<br/>
They cannot slow down what's meant for me<br/>
Funny how they come around like I can't see through their secret identities<br/>
Lately it's all about Zen and me<br/>
Subtractin' the negative energy<br/>
With the family, turn your ass to a memory<br/>
I'm with the team of the century<br/>
I blow the check up, detonation<br/>
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination<br/>
Time my destination<br/>
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflectin' Satan<br/>
I'm a motherfucking champion<br/>
This right here the fuckin' anthem<br/>
I can't dap you without hand san'<br/>
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been<br/>
I wake up to like a hundred texts<br/>
Championship team, but we can't cut the net<br/>
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed<br/>
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX<br/>
With 1500...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Travis Scott + Desiigner:]</i><br/>
1500, all in singles (straight up!)<br/>
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
Round and round they go, round and round they go<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
Ridin', be slimin' and ride with the woes<br/>
That nigga die in a hole<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude - Quavo:]</i><br/>
Lifestyle on camera<br/>
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier<br/>
They tried to turn me to an animal<br/>
But white people think I'm radical<br/>
Supermodels think I'm handsome<br/>
You might think I'm too aggressive<br/>
Really I think I'm too passive<br/>
Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
I took a nap in the pulpit<br/>
I never like how a suit fit<br/>
I got a pocket full of money<br/>
It got me walkin' all slew-foot<br/>
I'm on my wave like a cruise ship<br/>
In that hoe's mouth like a toothpick<br/>
Anyone get in my way<br/>
Nothin' to say, I tote them choppers like pool sticks<br/>
I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris<br/>
Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks<br/>
I come and find your apartments<br/>
We never had our damn pool fixed<br/>
Walk in the mall with my new bitch<br/>
Tell that bitch get the whole rack<br/>
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch<br/>
Then pull me a new bitch<br/>
See that is a snowball effect<br/>
I got gold on my neck<br/>
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck<br/>
I got a mansion full of marble floors<br/>
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch<br/>
Versace logo on bowls in this bitch<br/>
Like I'm a serial killer<br/>
I put the real in gorilla<br/>
I did this shit for my niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Travis Scott (Desiigner):]</i><br/>
1500, all in singles {straight up!}<br/>
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Round and round they go, round and round they go)<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Ridin', be slimin' and ride with the woes<br/>
That nigga die in a hole)<br/>
Champions, we run the city<br/>
Number one, they fallin' from the top<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Round and round they go, round and round they go)<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Ridin', be slimin' and ride with the woes<br/>
That nigga die in a hole)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5 - Yo Gotti:]</i><br/>
I'm Yo Gotti!<br/>
Reach for my chain is suicide<br/>
The car I drive fit two inside<br/>
They mad at Ye cause he all in the neighborhood<br/>
But he let them goons inside<br/>
Let's fuck up the neighborhood<br/>
Let's fuck up the neighborhood<br/>
Buy every house in this bitch<br/>
You know that the money good<br/>
My racks in the kitchen go round and round<br/>
Play with the kid, I'm a gun you down<br/>
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found<br/>
Official trapper let me show it down<br/>
More shit than a Pamper<br/>
All we rock is bandanas<br/>
Whips on nasty, no manners<br/>
I just got head in a Phantom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6 - Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ<br/>
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp<br/>
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp<br/>
And he don't ever sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp<br/>
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn<br/>
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am<br/>
I love my Auntie Jean, but fuck Uncle Sam<br/>
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram<br/>
Never test the kid so I don't have to clown<br/>
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown<br/>
And I don't really fuck around<br/>
I gave my bitch two mil' cause she stuck around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Travis Scott (Desiigner):]</i><br/>
1500, all in singles {straight up!}<br/>
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Round and round they go, round and round they go)<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Ridin', be slimin' and ride with the woes<br/>
That nigga die in a hole)<br/>
Champions, we run the city<br/>
Number one, they fallin' from the top<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Round and round they go, round and round they go)<br/>
Round and round they go<br/>
(Ridin', be slimin' and ride with the woes<br/>
That nigga die in a hole)
