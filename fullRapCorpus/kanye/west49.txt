Lot of dangerous necessity that people seek without regard<br/>
To where they are, the human heart is curious above all things,<br/>
laa the lights are low<br/>
your eyes are bright<br/>
the music, makes it sweet delight<br/>
It's out inside, I'm feeling right<br/>
your dress is tight<br/>
Oh waaaa ow, I want you right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Don't tell me you sing,you bout to get a deal<br/>
(You drunk and hot girls)<br/>
Aaa aaa aa aa aa, that's how the fuck you sound<br/>
(You drunk and hot girl)<br/>
You only live once do whatever you like<br/>
I thought I'd be with you for only one night<br/>
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life<br/>
That drunk and hot girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
We go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls<br/>
