<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now<br/>
feeling like my life froze<br/>
I’m about to hit the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West - Verse 1]</i><br/>
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal<br/>
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal<br/>
This game you could never win<br/>
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again<br/>
Get away from me misery<br/>
Get away from me loneliness<br/>
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness<br/>
Get away from me wack tracks<br/>
I can only make only hits<br/>
I’m an only child lost in the World<br/>
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring<br/>
its Feeling like hell rings<br/>
Bringing me back down<br/>
Checking my background<br/>
Its ironic whats happening<br/>
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends<br/>
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends<br/>
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk<br/>
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk<br/>
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more<br/>
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore<br/>
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him<br/>
And we ain’t finna change, so we’ll never agree again<br/>
till then I’ll be pouring out my soul<br/>
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now<br/>
feeling like my life froze<br/>
I’m about to hit the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West - Verse 2]</i><br/>
I sold my soul to the devil,<br/>
I know its a crappy deal,<br/>
at least it came with a few toys,<br/>
like a Happy Meal,<br/>
I’m spaced out dog,<br/>
I be on that moontalk,<br/>
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?<br/>
You know the entertainment Angels<br/>
Adriana for Giselle,<br/>
lets exchange Angels<br/>
photoshoot at my crib,<br/>
lets exchange angles<br/>
rockin nothin but them Tom Benz bangles,<br/>
I’m so anxious I’m gettin anxiety<br/>
begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me,<br/>
they say I’ve been an asshole,<br/>
I said if you acquire me,<br/>
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting<br/>
give me your herbal chai tea<br/>
I’ll be calm as Tai Chi<br/>
with a bad white bitch like Ice-T<br/>
I’m not right dog, I’m slightly off,<br/>
I’m Paranoid Like bonin’ Raw dog<br/>
and wakin up with a slight cough<br/>
yea, that’ll make ya dick quite soft<br/>
plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off<br/>
never meant to hurt you, I should’ve had nights off<br/>
but it cost too much to live and I never took the price off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now<br/>
feeling like my life froze<br/>
I’m about to hit the ground
