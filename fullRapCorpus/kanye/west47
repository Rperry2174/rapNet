I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven<br/>
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.<br/>
I told God I'd be back in a second,<br/>
Man it's so hard not to act reckless.<br/>
To whom much is given much is tested.<br/>
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.<br/>
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,<br/>
and what I do? Act more stupidly.<br/>
bought more jewelry, more Louis V, my momma couldn't get through to me.<br/>
The drama, people suing me,<br/>
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.<br/>
I'm just saying how I feel man,<br/>
I ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to Hill man<br/>
I guess the money should've changed him,<br/>
I guess I should've forgot where I came from.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right<br/>
la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right<br/>
Excuse Me, is you saying something?<br/>
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing<br/>
(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing<br/>
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing<br/>
<br/>
Let up the suicide doors.<br/>
This is my life homey, you decide yours.<br/>
I know that Jesus died for us,<br/>
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.<br/>
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways<br/>
Old folks talking about back in my day<br/>
But homey this is my day.<br/>
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?<br/>
You know I already graduated<br/>
And you can live through anything if magic made it.<br/>
<br/>
They say I talk with so much emphasis,<br/>
Oh, they're so sensitive.<br/>
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen<br/>
Say something were you gone end up apologising.<br/>
Let me know if it's a problem man,<br/>
Alright man, holla then.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,<br/>
Let that man get past.<br/>
You don't need a stop to get gas,<br/>
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cause<br/>
How he move in a room full of no's?<br/>
How he stay faithful in a room full of h**s?<br/>
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,<br/>
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.<br/>
Treasure. What's you pleasure?<br/>
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.<br/>
So if the devil wear Prada,<br/>
Adam Eve wear Nada,<br/>
I'm in between, but way more fresher.<br/>
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,<br/>
That's when you die hard.<br/>
Ya homies looking like "Why God?"<br/>
When they reminisce over you, my god.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
