Wake up Mr. West <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Piano drops]</i><br/>
<br/>
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.<br/>
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,<br/>
So this is in the name of love, like Robert says<br/>
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?<br/>
And I know the government administered AIDS,<br/>
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,<br/>
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,<br/>
Things we see on the screen are not ours,<br/>
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,<br/>
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,<br/>
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,<br/>
I guess they want us all behind bars.<br/>
I know it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Adam Levine)]</i><br/>
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.<br/>
(ooooooooo)<br/>
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.<br/>
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)<br/>
But we'll find a way<br/>
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye]</i><br/>
They say people in your life are seasons,<br/>
And anything that happen is for a reason,<br/>
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',<br/>
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',<br/>
And Jesus and one day that ya see him,<br/>
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,<br/>
The devil is alive I feel him breathin',<br/>
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',<br/>
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,<br/>
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,<br/>
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,<br/>
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,<br/>
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?<br/>
I can't figure it out...<br/>
Im Stickin around....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Adam Levine)]</i><br/>
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.<br/>
(ooooooooo)<br/>
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.<br/>
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)<br/>
But we'll find a way<br/>
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)<br/>
<br/>
(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,<br/>
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)<br/>
<br/>
