<i>[Intro - Kanye West]</i><br/>
Yeah.<br/>
And you say Chi city,<br/>
Chi city, Chi city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Chris Martin]</i><br/>
I'm coming home again.<br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Cause I'm coming home again<br/>
I'm in home again.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West]</i><br/>
I met this girl when I was three years old<br/>
And what I loved most she had so much soul<br/>
She said, excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me- but,<br/>
My name is Windy and, I like to blow trees and,<br/>
From that point I never blow her off,<br/>
They can come from outta town I like to show her off,<br/>
They like to act tough, she like to tow em off,<br/>
And make em straighten up their act, cause she know they soft<br/>
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown<br/>
And at nighttime my face lit up so astounding<br/>
And I told her in my heart is where she always be<br/>
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave<br/>
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me<br/>
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me<br/>
I guess it's why last winter she got so cold on me<br/>
She said, Ye keep making that, keep making that platinum and gold for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Chris Martin]</i><br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Cause I'm coming home again<br/>
I'm in home again<br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Oh, now I'm coming home again<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can start again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Kanye West]</i><br/>
But if you really care for her, then you would n-never hit the airport,<br/>
To follow your dream, sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her<br/>
It always seems like she talking about me,<br/>
She said you left your kids and they just like you<br/>
They wanna rap and make show beats just like you,<br/>
But they just not you and I just got through<br/>
Talking bout what she can try to do just not new<br/>
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong<br/>
I guess you never know what you got till its gone<br/>
I guess this is why I'm here and I cant come back home<br/>
And guess when I heard that when I was back home<br/>
Every interview I'm representing you making you proud<br/>
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud<br/>
Jump in the crowd, spark you lighters, wave em around,<br/>
And if you don't know by now, I'm talking about Chi Town,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Chris Martin]</i><br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Do you think about me now and then?<br/>
Cause I'm coming home again<br/>
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan<br/>
Oh, now I'm coming home again<br/>
I'm in home again<br/>
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan<br/>
Oh, now I'm coming home again<br/>
Maybe we can start again<br/>
<br/>
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh<br/>
Coming home again<br/>
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh<br/>
Coming home again<br/>
Maybe we can start again
