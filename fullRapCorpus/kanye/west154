<i>[Intro - Rihanna &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Man I can understand how it might be<br/>
Kinda hard to love a girl like me<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
Swizz told me let the beat rock<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West &amp; Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
For all my Southside niggas that know me best<br/>
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex<br/>
Why? I made that bitch famous, God damn<br/>
I made that bitch famous<br/>
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West<br/>
If you see em in the streets give em Kanye's best<br/>
Why? They mad they ain't famous, God damn<br/>
They mad they're still nameless, Talk that talk, man<br/>
Her man in the store tryna try his best<br/>
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh<br/>
But we still hood famous, God damn<br/>
Yeah we still hood famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
I loved you better than your own kin did<br/>
From the very start<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
Maybach Music<br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
The furnace, fires, fortunes, and the fumes<br/>
The aura arrogance is been known to fill the room<br/>
Boom, little nigga who are you?<br/>
Roc-A-Fella Records on record to kill a crew<br/>
Vegas in my palms a don like the<br/>
Only one with beat taste from Kanye on my momma stew<br/>
For the ye I've been known to be Karmaloop<br/>
Malcom X in his head say my name and here come to troops<br/>
Hands out my pocket I cock it and let it loose<br/>
And Dame was spilling I'm Adele on a nigga boots<br/>
Martin Luther King's real estate was a dream<br/>
Farrakhan's farm was one that I once seen<br/>
The final call dogs stay on your dean<br/>
Fragrances Agent Provocateur stay on my queen<br/>
Mind your business the killers can intervene<br/>
I'm half naked in the GQ magazine<br/>
Tours looking like its wrestlemania<br/>
I'm The Rock setting fires to the stadium<br/>
Burn it down then I'm off to anther beat<br/>
Might get engages to a freak just for a couple weeks<br/>
Something I can't afford<br/>
If you not a playboy that's something I can't endorse<br/>
Win, lose, or draw William living like he Biggie Smalls<br/>
Balling its tax season I was born to be a boss<br/>
See that your face froze<br/>
Bobby Brown lockjaw, Whitney Houston in the ghost<br/>
Coogie and Cartier causalities of the fame<br/>
Your bitch MCM she even tagging my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Sister Nancy &amp; Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
Bam bam, bam bam<br/>
Bam bam dilla, bam bam<br/>

How you feeling right now? Let me see your lighters in the air<br/>
Bam bam dilla, bam bam<br/>

Ey what a bam bam<br/>
Bam bam dilla, bam bam<br/>
How you feeling, how you feeling, how you feeling in this mother fucker, God damn<br/>
Bam bam<br/>
One thing you can't do is stop us now<br/>
Bam bam, bam bam<br/>
Bam bam dilla, bam bam<br/>
You can't stop the thing now<br/>
Ey what a bam bam<br/>
Man it's way too late, it's way too late, it's way too late you can't fuck with us<br/>
Bam bam dilla, bam bam<br/>

I wanna see everybody hands in the air like this<br/>

Bam bam dilla, bam bam<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Nina Simone:]</i><br/>

I loved you better than your own kin did<br/>
From the very start<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
I just wanted you to know
