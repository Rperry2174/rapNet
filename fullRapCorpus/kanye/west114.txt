<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
My momma was raised in an era when,<br/>
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin<br/>
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help<br/>
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.<br/>
You see it's broke nigga racism<br/>
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"<br/>
And there's rich nigga racism<br/>
That's that "Come here, please buy more"<br/>
What you want a Bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?<br/>
All you blacks want all the same things<br/>
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me<br/>
Spending everything on Alexander Wang<br/>
New Slaves<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You see it's leaders and there's followers<br/>
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower<br/>
<br/>
You see it's leaders and there's followers<br/>
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I throw these Maybach keys<br/>
I wear my heart on the sleeve<br/>
I know that we the new slaves<br/>
I see the blood on the leaves<br/>
I see the blood on the leaves<br/>
I see the blood on the leaves<br/>
I know that we the new slaves<br/>
I see the blood on the leaves<br/>
They throwing hate at me<br/>
Want me to stay at ease<br/>
Fuck you and your corporation<br/>
Y'all niggas can't control me<br/>
I know that we the new slaves<br/>
I know that we the new slaves<br/>
I'm about to wild the fuck out<br/>
I'm going Bobby Boucher<br/>
I know that pussy ain't free<br/>
You niggas pussy, ain't me<br/>
Y'all throwing contracts at me<br/>
You know that niggas can't read<br/>
Throw on some Maybach keys<br/>
Fuck it, c'est la vie<br/>
I know that we the new slaves<br/>
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me<br/>
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye<br/>
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye<br/>
I'll move my family out the country<br/>
So you can't see where I stay<br/>
So go and grab the reporters<br/>
So I can smash their recorders<br/>
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order<br/>
Meanwhile the DEA<br/>
Teamed up with the CCA<br/>
They tryna lock niggas up<br/>
They tryna make new slaves<br/>
See that's that private owned prison<br/>
Get your piece today<br/>
They Probably all in the Hamptons<br/>
Braggin' 'bout their maid<br/>
Fuck you and your Hampton house<br/>
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse<br/>
Came on her Hampton blouse<br/>
And in her Hampton mouth<br/>
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up<br/>
I'm 'bout to tear shit down<br/>
I'm 'bout to air shit out<br/>
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?
