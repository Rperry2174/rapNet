<i>[Luther Vandross]</i><br/>
Are you gonna be?<br/>
Say that you're gonna be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jamie Foxx]</i><br/>
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Jamie Foxx):]</i><br/>
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right<br/>
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be? Well well well well well)<br/>
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party off right<br/>
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be? Well well well well well)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I told her to drive over in your new whip<br/>
Bring some friends you cool with<br/>
I'm gonna bring the cool whip<br/>
Then I want you to strip<br/>
See you is my new chick<br/>
So we get our grind on<br/>
She be grabbing, calling me Biggie like Shine home<br/>
Man, I swear she fine homes<br/>
Why she always lying though<br/>
Telling me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones<br/>
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson<br/>
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson<br/>
I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action<br/>
My dawg said you ain't no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong<br/>
I'm a play this Vandross<br/>
You're gonna take your pants off<br/>
I'm gonna play this Gladys Knight<br/>
Me and you're gonna get right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
Got you looking at the gliss at my hands and wrists<br/>
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis<br/>
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther<br/>
I can tell you ain't no messing with Kan-man and Twist<br/>
From the Chi and I be<br/>
Sipping Hennessy<br/>
Play some R&amp;B<br/>
Trying to smoke a B<br/>
Looking properly<br/>
Feeling on a G?<br/>
And always (well well well well well)<br/>
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne<br/>
You ain't know Twista can work it like the Whispers<br/>
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac<br/>
The rims still moving so I'm bumping little spinners<br/>
While I'm smoking on a B<br/>
Dipping through the streets<br/>
Bumping R&amp;B<br/>
And I got to leave<br/>
something to the 23's?<br/>
And I do it (well well well well well)<br/>
With my earth and the wind smoke a fire<br/>
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat<br/>
Put you in a daze for maze<br/>
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex<br/>
You ready for the world girl<br/>
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me<br/>
An every moment you controllin' me I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci<br/>
And when I come over and bend your ass<br/>
You be bumping Teddy Pendergrass<br/>
I'd hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow<br/>
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'm gonna finish last<br/>
No matter how much of a thug you see<br/>
I still spit it like it's R&amp;B, so to the club with me<br/>
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and still be in love with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
Baby drop another slow jam<br/>
And all us lovers need hold hands<br/>
And if you ain't got no man hop up in my Brougham<br/>
I keep it pimping like an old man<br/>
You got to roll with the plan<br/>
Cause after that then I<br/>
Take it to the dome<br/>
Then I got to bone<br/>
Stay up in the zone<br/>
Got to get you home<br/>
Gotta run up on<br/>
And I do it (well well well well well)<br/>
Baby drop another slow jam<br/>
And all us lovers need hold hands<br/>
And if you ain't got no man hop up on my brohem<br/>
I keep it pimping like an old man<br/>
You got to roll with the plan<br/>
Cause after that then I<br/>
Take you to my home<br/>
And we could get it on<br/>
Disconnect the phone<br/>
Just to get you goin'<br/>
Trying to make you moan<br/>
And I do it (well well well well well)
