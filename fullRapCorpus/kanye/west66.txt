<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Didn't you know <br/>
I was waiting on you<br/>
Waiting on a dream <br/>
That'll never come true<br/>
Didn't you know <br/>
I was waiting on you<br/>
My face turnt to stone<br/>
When I heard the news<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When you decide to break the rules<br/>
Cos I just heard some real bad news<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
People will talk<br/>
Like its old news<br/>
I played it off and act like I already knew<br/>
Let me ask you <br/>
How long have you known too<br/>
You played it off and act like he's brand new<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When you decide to break the rules<br/>
Cos I just heard some real bad news<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Real bad news<br/>
Real bad news<br/>
Real bad news<br/>
<br/>
Oh you just gonna <br/>
Keep another no you wont<br/>
<br/>
Oh you just gonna<br/>
Keep it like you never knew<br/>
<br/>
Oh you just gonna <br/>
Keep another love for you<br/>
<br/>
Oh you just gonna<br/>
Keep it ike you never knew<br/>
<br/>
While im waiting on a dream <br/>
That'll never come true<br/>
<br/>
Oh you just gonna <br/>
Keep it like you never knew<br/>
<br/>
My face turnt to stone<br/>
When I heard the news<br/>
