Yeah, you know what this is<br/>
It's a celebration, bitches!<br/>
Grab a drink, grab a glass <br/>
After that I grab yo ass<br/>
<br/>
Why you actin' all<br/>
Shy and all<br/>
Why is y'all<br/>
Lyin' for?<br/>
"I never did this before..."<br/>
Stop that<br/>
What, you want some petron?<br/>
I got that.<br/>
I mean I promise y'all<br/>
You fine and all<br/>
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw <br/>
But she not like you<br/>
No, she not like you<br/>
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue<br/>
All that talkin is gon' give me a tylenol<br/>
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of ya'll<br/>
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off<br/>
But, I just thought you should know<br/>
We hit the liquor store<br/>
Got some Cris and some Mo<br/>
And we about to let it floooooow<br/>
Had some problems before but see we let em go<br/>
Got an ounce of that dro<br/>
And we about to let it bloooooow<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know what this is<br/>
It's a celebration, bitches!<br/>
Grab a drink, grab a glass<br/>
After that, I grab yo ass<br/>
<br/>
See you know my style<br/>
I'm very wild<br/>
And I vow that my child will be well endowed<br/>
Like his daddy<br/>
And tell him that your mama had a fattie<br/>
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"<br/>
Yep, we was praticing <br/>
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging<br/>
You know what though? You my favorite accident <br/>
So go head pop some Cristal <br/>
For my newborn child cuz now y'all<br/>
<br/>
Know what this is<br/>
It's a celebration, bitches!<br/>
Grab a drink, grab a glass<br/>
After that I grab yo ass<br/>
But, I just thought you should know<br/>
We hit the liquor store<br/>
Got some cris and some mo<br/>
And we about to let it floooooow<br/>
Had some problems before but see we let em go<br/>
Got an ounce of that dro<br/>
And we about to let it bloooooow<br/>
<br/>
Ho! Ho! (We lookin' for some) Ho! Ho!
