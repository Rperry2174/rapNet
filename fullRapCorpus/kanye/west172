Get in... Get in... oha... the Roc in here<br/>
it's your boy Kanye to the... listen up man...<br/>
<br/>
I get girls in my room like hostages<br/>
given me neck like ostriches<br/>
getten some play to real Kanye <br/>
cause we all know who do you Possies is<br/>
<br/>
All my Gangsters mob to this<br/>
and all my strippers do your job to this<br/>
hell no I can't give you my cell phone<br/>
but you know where the hotel lobby is<br/>
<br/>
For ya'll the same girls wouldn't give me no ass<br/>
nahana haly<i>[?]</i> surpass my whole upper-class<br/>
better if I meet her now I can fuck her fast<br/>
I pass... I be on some new shit<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't fuck none of the girls I went to school with<br/>
fuck around I ain't be on no cool shit<br/>
lay on see the models that me in my crew get on<br/>
see the fabolous duce I bought with the blueprint<br/>
<br/>
She say: "Whoa! Kanye don't get caught up in the high,<br/>
?ain't no tell a neggle? left you after the night."<br/>
We'll lift the nice tonight pop bottles fuck models<br/>
sear money to your broke my Nigga live your life<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm livin' and actin' on Nigga American Dream<br/>
and all my dogs livin' by care sweet with me<br/>
so if I get here from dream that one for the team<br/>
fuck 7-0-2 that one for the crew<br/>
<br/>
My thought Hip Hop really low crowded<i>[?]</i><br/>
so if I ever get the smash this fuck's for you<br/>
I can barely dry the G fight I came by<br/>
just like a brainshot they know it's money in the side
