<i>[Intro: Kanye West]</i><br/>
How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)<br/>
He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)<br/>
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?<br/>
(all, all, all the glitter is not gold)<br/>
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality)<br/>
(real is what you live to be)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
This is family business<br/>
And this is for the family that can't be with us<br/>
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us<br/>
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet<br/>
Like a photo of your granny's picture<br/>
Now that you're gone it hit us<br/>
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right<br/>
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life<br/>
Somebody please say grace so I can save face<br/>
And have a reason to cover my face<br/>
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it<br/>
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it<br/>
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?<br/>
As kids we used to laugh<br/>
Who knew that life would move this fast?<br/>
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?<br/>
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it<br/>
And if you did, then that's family business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Choir]</i><br/>
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)<br/>
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)<br/>
All these fancy things<br/>
I tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold<br/>
Now all I know I know all these things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
This is family business<br/>
And this is for everybody standin' with us<br/>
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture<br/>
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?<br/>
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"<br/>
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it<br/>
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite<br/>
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider<br/>
But when we get together be electric slidin'<br/>
Grandma, get 'em shook up<br/>
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up<br/>
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name<br/>
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane<br/>
You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude<br/>
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food<br/>
And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins<br/>
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins<br/>
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins<br/>
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg<br/>
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Choir]</i><br/>
Rain, rain, rain go away<br/>
Let the sun come out and all the children say<br/>
Rain, rain, rain go away<br/>
Let the sun come out and all the children say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind<br/>
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns<br/>
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God<br/>
And keep your face to the risin' sun<br/>
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog<br/>
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog<br/>
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog<br/>
You can still love your man and be manly dog<br/>
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'<br/>
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman<br/>
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?<br/>
The second she storms out then he storms in<br/>
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion<br/>
And drink some wine like Communion<br/>
And act like everything fine and if it isn't<br/>
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Choir]</i><br/>
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)<br/>
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)<br/>
They don't mean a thing<br/>
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)<br/>
They don't mean a thing, a thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Choir]</i><br/>
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)<br/>
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)<br/>
All these fancy things<br/>
I tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold<br/>
Now all I know I know all these things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Females:]</i> (oooh) All these things (these things)<br/>
<i>[Males:]</i> All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)<br/>
<i>[F:]</i> All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)<br/>
<i>[M:]</i> All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)<br/>
<i>[F:]</i> All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)<br/>
<i>[M:]</i> All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)<br/>
<i>[F:]</i> All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)<br/>
<i>[M:]</i> All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
