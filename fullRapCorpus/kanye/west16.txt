<i>[Man]</i><br/>
Hey Jimmy where you going?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jimmy]</i><br/>
I dont know where I'm goin.<br/>
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.<br/>
My mom would always say "Dad, why dont you work?", <br/>
But he just kept learning.<br/>
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school, <br/>
And I was actaully in school all when my dad was in school.<br/>
He was so gready with degrees, he took my degree.<br/>
And now I'm just glad he left me these.<br/>
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have. <br/>
These are documented.<br/>
My father left them for me.<br/>
And Im going to leave them to my kids.<br/>
I'm going to learn too.<br/>
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.<br/>
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.<br/>
Who has that.
