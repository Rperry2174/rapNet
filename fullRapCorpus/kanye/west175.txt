Let me get more volume<br/>
Nah, nah<br/>
Louder and my voice<br/>
<br/>
Roll some, think I’ll roll some<br/>
To know some, if we both honest<br/>
Who lasts? yeah, you lie<br/>
Spent the whole summer<br/>
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time<br/>
But I know what's mine when I see it<br/>
I know, I know, I know when I see it<br/>
Riding down the 405, baby<br/>
Pacing, thinking, to myself<br/>
If I should make it right<br/>
When I pulled up to the light<br/>
And then my phone started ringing<br/>
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes<br/>
Don’t know why, but I know a sign when I see it
