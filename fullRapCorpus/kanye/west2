What in the fuck was that Kanye<br/>
I told you to do some shit for the kids<br/>
You can give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now<br/>
You will not walk across that stage, you won’t slide across that stage<br/>
A muthafucka can’t pull you across that stage Kanye<br/>
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting<br/>
I’m trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me<br/>
You know what us a nigga<br/>
And I don’t mean that in no nice way<br/>
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you<br/>
You throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody<br/>
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus<br/>
Mutha what you gone do now<br/>
<br/>
I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.<br/>
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.<br/>
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody.<br/>
My momma would kill me but don't anybody.<br/>
she wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody. <br/>
She ain'twalked in my shoes i'm just not everybody.
