On lonely nights I start to fade <br/>
(On lonely nights I start to fade) <br/>
Her love is a thousand miles away <br/>
(Her love is a thousand miles away) <br/>
Memories made in the coldest winter <br/>
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again <br/>
<br/>
Memories made in the coldest winter <br/>
<br/>
It's 4am and I can't sleep <br/>
(It's 4am and I can't sleep) <br/>
Her love is all that I can see <br/>
(Her love is all that I can see) <br/>
Memories made in the coldest winter <br/>
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again <br/>
<br/>
Memories made in the coldest winter <br/>
Winter, winter <br/>
<br/>
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again <br/>
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again <br/>
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again <br/>
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again <br/>
<br/>
If spring can take the snow away <br/>
(If spring can take the snow away) <br/>
Can it melt away all of our mistakes <br/>
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes) <br/>
Memories made in the coldest winter <br/>
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again <br/>
<br/>
Never Again
