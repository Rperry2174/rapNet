<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
This is something like the Holocaust<br/>
Millions of our people lost<br/>
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord<br/>
Til I die I’ma fuckin’ ball<br/>
Now who gon’ stop me?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Black cards, black cars,<br/>
Black on black, black broads<br/>
Whole lotta money in a black bag<br/>
Black strap, you know what that’s for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Who gon’ stop me, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yeah, who gon’ stop me?<br/>
No brakes, I need, State Farm<br/>
So many watches I need 8 arms<br/>
One neck but got 8 charms<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Who gon’ stop me, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Niggas talkin’, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay<br/>
That’s pig Latin, itch-bay<br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
Last night ain’t go so well<br/>
Got kicked up out the hotel<br/>
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert<br/>
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell<br/>
You just a commentator, if you getting paper<br/>
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters<br/>
In some relations, you just supposed to say none<br/>
Heard she fucked the doorman<br/>
Well that’s cool I fucked the waitress<br/>
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that’s on one basis<br/>
I only like green faces<br/>
<br/>
This is something like the Holocaust<br/>
Millions of our people lost<br/>
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord<br/>
Til I die I’ma fuckin’ ball<br/>
<br/>
Now who gon’ stop me?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Black cards, black cars<br/>
Black on black, black broads<br/>
Whole lotta money in a black bag<br/>
Black strap, you know what that’s for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Y’all weed purple, my money purple<br/>
Y’all Steve Urkel, I’m Oprah circle<br/>
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Who gone stop me huh?<br/>
Beat the odds, best the Feds<br/>
It wouldn’t be wise, to bet against the kid<br/>
Start me broke, I bet I get rich<br/>
Night shift, 6 to 6<br/>
Gimmie one shot, one pot<br/>
I’ll show up in all white, wearing no socks<br/>
No ceiling, new coupe<br/>
They know I’m a dope boy<br/>
They don’t have no proof<br/>
I’m 3 steps removed, I know how to move<br/>
It’s looking like, I don’t know how to lose<br/>
I’m winning again, I’m at the Wynn<br/>
I’m at the table, I’m gambling,<br/>
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,<br/>
I went through hell, I’m expecting heaven, I’m owed,<br/>
I’m throwed and I stuck to the G-code,<br/>
I’m here, oh yeah, I promise I ain’t going nowhere,<br/>
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats<br/>
I’m allergic to having bunny ears,<br/>
Like broke, like nope, like ha,<br/>
I ain’t no joke, I can’t be stopped<br/>
Like nope, like nope<br/>
To the beat Noah…<br/>
<br/>
2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card<br/>
Told y’all I was gonna go HAM, told the ocean was my backyard<br/>
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses<br/>
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless<br/>
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head<br/>
If it wasn’t for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead<br/>
I’m living life, til these niggas kill me<br/>
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me<br/>
I’m riding dirty, trying to get filthy<br/>
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes<br/>
Graduated to the MOMA<br/>
And I did all of this, without a diploma<br/>
Graduated from the corner<br/>
Y’all can play me for a motherfuckin’ fool if you wanna,<br/>
Street smart, and I’m book smart<br/>
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart<br/>
Only thing to stop me is me,<br/>
And I’ma stop when the hook start<br/>
Hold up<br/>
<br/>

Now who gon’ stop me?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me?<br/>
Who gon’ stop me huh?<br/>
