<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
You might think you've peeped the scene<br/>
You haven't<br/>
The real one's far too mean<br/>
The watered-down one<br/>
The one you know<br/>
Was made up centuries ago<br/>
They made it sound all wack and corny<br/>
Yes, it's awful blasted boring<br/>
Twisted fiction<br/>
Sick addiction<br/>
Well gather round children<br/>
Zip it<br/>
Listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Teyana Taylor:]</i><br/>
Can we get much higher?<br/>
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Can we get much higher?<br/>
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Can we get much higher?<br/>
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Can we get much higher?<br/>
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago<br/>
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago<br/>
That's me, the first year that I blow<br/>
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo<br/>
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo<br/>
Me found bravery in my bravado<br/>
DJs need to listen to the models<br/>
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?<br/>
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)<br/>
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?<br/>
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow<br/>
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo<br/>
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Teyana Taylor:]</i><br/>
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion<br/>
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis<br/>
Beyond the truest<br/>
Hey, teacher, teacher<br/>
Tell me how do you respond to students?<br/>
And refresh the page and restart the memory?<br/>
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?<br/>
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies<br/>
Sorry for the night demons still visit me<br/>
The plan was to drink until the pain over<br/>
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?<br/>
Fresh air, rolling down the window<br/>
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low<br/>
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh<br/>
Don't make me pull the toys<br/>
And fire up the engines<br/>
And then they make noise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Teyana Taylor:]</i><br/>
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West and Bon Iver:]</i><br/>
At the mall there was a seance<br/>
Just kids, no parents<br/>
Then the sky filled with herons<br/>
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron<br/>
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us<br/>
And the fires did declare us<br/>
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress<br/>
And woke up back in Paris<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Teyana Taylor:]</i><br/>
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
