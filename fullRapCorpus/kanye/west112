For my theme song, my leather black jeans on<br/>
My by any means on, pardon I'm getting my scream on<br/>
Enter the kingdom but watch who you bring home<br/>
They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong<br/>
Middle America packed in, came to see me in my black skin<br/>
Number one question they asking. Fuck every question you asking<br/>
If I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists<br/>
Claiming I'm overreacting like them black kids in Chiraq bitch<br/>
<br/>
Four in the morning, and I'm zonin'<br/>
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen<br/>
I keep it 300, like the Romans<br/>
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?<br/>
Baby we livin' in the moment<br/>
I've been a menace for the longest<br/>
But I ain't finished I'm devoted<br/>
And you know it, and you know it<br/>
<br/>
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down<br/>
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now<br/>
But there's nowhere to go, now<br/>
And there's no way to slow down<br/>
If I knew what I knew in the past<br/>
I would have been blacked out on your ass<br/>
<br/>
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'<br/>
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen<br/>
I keep it 300, like the Romans<br/>
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?<br/>
Baby we livin' in the moment<br/>
I've been a menace for the longest<br/>
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted<br/>
And you know it, and you know it<br/>
<br/>
Stop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit<br/>
This is that goon shit, fuck up your whole afternoon shit<br/>
I'm aware I'm a wolf, soon as the moon hit<br/>
I'm aware I'm a king, back out the tomb bitch<br/>
Black out the room bitch, stop all that coon shit<br/>
These niggas ain't doin' shit, them niggas ain't doin' shit<br/>
Come on, homie, what happened?<br/>
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping<br/>
These niggas ain't ready for action<br/>
(Ready, ready for action)<br/>
<br/>
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'<br/>
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen<br/>
I keep it 300, like the Romans<br/>
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?<br/>
Baby we're livin' in the moment<br/>
I've been a menace for the longest<br/>
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted<br/>
And you know it, and you know it<br/>
<br/>
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down<br/>
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now<br/>
But there's nowhere to go, now<br/>
And there's no way to slow down<br/>
If I knew what I knew in the past<br/>
I would've been blacked out on your ass<br/>
<br/>
God <i>[11x]</i>
