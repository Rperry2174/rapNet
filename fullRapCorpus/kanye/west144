Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like<br/>
Alright, okay, tonight you're havin' me your way<br/>
Perfume, spray it there, put our love in the air<br/>
Now put me right next to you, finna raise the temp' in the room<br/>
First rub my back like you do, right there (uh)<br/>
Right there (uh,) you touch me like you care<br/>
Now stop, and let me repay you for the week you've been through<br/>
Workin' that nine to five and bein' cute, like you do<br/>
Ooh, ooh, ooh<br/>
<br/>
I love it, I love it<br/>
You love it, you love it<br/>
Every time, every time<br/>
We touchin', we touchin'<br/>
I want it, I want it<br/>
You want it, you want it<br/>
I'll see you, see you<br/>
In the mornin', in the mornin'<br/>
<br/>
Wanna put my fingers through your hair<br/>
Wrap me up in your legs<br/>
Then love you 'til your eyes roll back<br/>
I'm tryna put you to bed, to bed, to bed<br/>
I wanna put you to bed, to bed, to bed<br/>
Then I'ma rock ya body, turn you over<br/>
Love is war, I'm your soldier<br/>
Touchin' you like it's our first time<br/>
I'ma put you to bed, to bed, to bed<br/>
Girl I'ma put you to bed, to bed, to bed<br/>
<br/>
I'm staring at you while you sleep, irreplaceable beauty<br/>
Put my face up in your neck and breathe (Oh, breathe)<br/>
Take you into my senses, wake up, it's time to finish<br/>
Round two, it's a round two<br/>
Matter of fact, it's closer to three<br/>
She like, "How long I been sleep?"<br/>
Shawty kisses turn into the sweetest dreams<br/>
Girl give it to me<br/>
And I can feel her turn weak<br/>
"My angel, this is wonderful"<br/>
Thanks for lettin' me bless ya<br/>
Come down, fly right<br/>
Drift back into heaven<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, woah<br/>
<br/>
I love it, I love it<br/>
You love it, you love it<br/>
Every time, every time<br/>
We touchin', we touchin'<br/>
I want it, I want it<br/>
You want it, you want it<br/>
I'll see you, see you<br/>
In the mornin', in the mornin'<br/>
<br/>
Wanna put my fingers through your hair<br/>
Wrap me up in your legs<br/>
Then love you 'til your eyes roll back<br/>
I'm tryna put you to bed, to bed, to bed<br/>
I wanna put you to bed, to bed, to bed<br/>
