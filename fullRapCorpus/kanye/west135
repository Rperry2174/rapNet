<i>[Max B:]</i><br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, what's good?<br/>
It's your boy Max B, what's going on?<br/>
Just checking in on you<br/>
Appreciate the love and support<br/>
The wave is here<br/>
You a wavey dude anyway, so you already know<br/>
Ain't no problem, man, the game...<br/>
You already know how this game thing goes<br/>
Do your wave nigga<br/>
You got the official wave man<br/>
Just, just doing you...<br/>
Doing you, doing your wave<br/>
And keep it loopy, I know you're going to keep it loopy man<br/>
Shoutout, just shout you out<br/>
Hollering at you man, it's all love<br/>
I appreciate the... the energy<br/>
And we here, hit the town, we do something big<br/>
We gonna make a big tsunami up in the joint<br/>
You already know what it is, ahh<br/>
<br/>
