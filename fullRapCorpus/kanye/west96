<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
It was all good just a week ago<br/>
niggas feel theyselves and then Watch The Throne drop<br/>
niggas kill themselves<br/>
What niggas gon do Hov?<br/>
This a new crack on a new stove<br/>
I'm in the two-door, true that<br/>
niggas tellin' me "You back"<br/>
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?<br/>
and if life a bitch suck my dick huh?<br/>
and I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh<br/>
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga<br/>
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it<br/>
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it<br/>
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me<br/>
Or-gy, or are we speakin methaphorically<br/>
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga<br/>
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga<br/>
and a nigga still young, wanna have no kids<br/>
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit<br/>
And a few white girls, asses flat a shit<br/>
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit<br/>
Got em jumpin' out the building<br/>
Watch out below, a million out the door<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to go HAM<br/>
Hard As a Muthafucker,<br/>
Let these niggas know who I am<br/>
I'm about to go HAM<br/>
Hard As a Muthafucker,<br/>
Let these niggas know who I am<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
fuck y'all mad at me for?<br/>
You don't even know what I've been through<br/>
I play chicken with a Mack truck<br/>
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved<br/>
I swam waters with great whites<br/>
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed<br/>
I hustle with vultures late nights<br/>
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food<br/>
fuck wrong with these dudes<br/>
Try to walk around in these shoes<br/>
See the shit I saw growing up<br/>
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's<br/>
niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like<br/>
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really<br/>
I'm like really half a billi nigga<br/>
Really you got baby money<br/>
Keep it real with niggas<br/>
niggas ain't got my lady money<br/>
Watch the Throne don't step on our road<br/>
Bad enough we let you step on our globe<br/>
When my nephew died, daddy dead<br/>
niggas took the price on my uncles head<br/>
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled<br/>
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread<br/>
Bow down, brother pay homage<br/>
don't spill hate all on my garments<br/>
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh<br/>
head shots nigga fuck your vests<br/>
fuck the pig, no pork on my fork<br/>
Peace God cause you know a nigga just went Ham<br/>
<br/>
Hard As a Muthafucker,<br/>
Let these niggas know who I am<br/>
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM<br/>
Hard As a Muthafucker,<br/>
Let these niggas know who I am<br/>
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
