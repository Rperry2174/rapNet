<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Its what you all been waiting for ain't it?<br/>
What people pay paper for damn it<br/>
They cant stand it, they want something new<br/>
So let's get re-acquainted<br/>
Became the hood favorite<br/>
I cant even explain it<br/>
I surprise myself too<br/>
<br/>
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'<br/>
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm<br/>
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kanye West]</i><br/>
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)<br/>
We outta here baby!<br/>
We outta here baby!<br/>
We outta here baby!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Dude!<br/>
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches<br/>
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot<br/>
As for what I did it, that asshole done did it<br/>
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted<br/>
I don't need to write hits, I might bounce ideas,<br/>
But only I could come up with some shit like this<br/>
I done played the underdog my whole career<br/>
Ive been a very good sport, haven't I, this year<br/>
They said he's going crazy and we seen this before<br/>
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go<br/>
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo<br/>
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no low-head<br/>
Cos my Dior got me more model head<br/>
I'm insulted<br/>
You should go head<br/>
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead<br/>
And the flow just hit code red<br/>
Top 5 MC's you ain't gotta remind me<br/>
Top 5 MC's you gotta rewind me<br/>
I'm high up on the line, you can get behind me<br/>
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me<br/>
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'<br/>
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm<br/>
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, We outta here baby!<br/>
Wha, Wha, We outta here baby!<br/>
And Mr. West is so outta here baby<br/>
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm so bright not shady<br/>
My teeth and my eyes so wight like Shady<br/>
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated<br/>
I’m so fucking good like I’m sleeping with Megan<br/>
I’m all about my franklins, Lincolns and Reagans<br/>
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them<br/>
Oops I meant have them, I'm so crazy<br/>
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies<br/>
Its such a hayvic, oops I meant havoc<br/>
And my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit<br/>
And I'm still cold (cole) like Keisha's family<br/>
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties<br/>
And I ate it cos I'm so at it<br/>
I don't front and I don't go backwards<br/>
And I don't practice<br/>
and I don't lack shit<br/>
And you can get Barried<br/>
Suck my bat bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kanye West]</i><br/>
We outta here baby<br/>
We outta here baby<br/>
We outta here baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'<br/>
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on<br/>
Wit something crazy on my arm<br/>
Ha Ha Hum, man here's another hit, Barry Bonds<br/>
<br/>
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
