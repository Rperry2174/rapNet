Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?<br/>
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?<br/>
Wake up, nigga, wake up<br/>
We bout to get this paper<br/>
<br/>
Money never made me<br/>
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me<br/>
Even if the money low, can't pay me<br/>
Even if the money low, can't play me<br/>
<br/>
Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?<br/>
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?<br/>
Wake up, nigga, wake up<br/>
We bout to get this paper<br/>
<br/>
Pablo bought a Roley and a rottweiler<br/>
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder<br/>
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us<br/>
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us<br/>
I've been outta my mind a long time<br/>
I've been outta my mind a long time<br/>
I’ve been saying how I feel at the wrong time<br/>
Might not come when you want but I'm on time<br/>
<br/>
Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?<br/>
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?<br/>
Wake up, nigga, wake up<br/>
We 'bout to get this paper<br/>
<br/>
I can’t let these people play me<br/>
Name one genius that ain't crazy<br/>
Follow our father<br/>
You borrow our motto<br/>
I'm a Chicago south sider<br/>
I'm a Chicago south sider<br/>
<br/>
Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?<br/>
Y'all sleeping on your boy, had a good snooze?<br/>
Wake up, nigga, wake up<br/>
It's time to get the paper<br/>
<br/>
I've been outta my mind a long time<br/>
I've been outta my mind a long time<br/>
I know, I know, I shouldn’t even bother<br/>
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers<br/>
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume<br/>
PETA's mad cause I made a jacket outta possum<br/>
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin<br/>
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton<br/>
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman<br/>
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems<br/>
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in<br/>
Driving in the same uh that they killed Pac in<br/>
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us<br/>
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us<br/>
<br/>
Hold on, hold on, hold on<br/>
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah<br/>
You know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!<br/>
You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!
