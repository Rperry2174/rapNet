<i>[Rihanna &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Man I can understand how it might be<br/>
Kinda hard to love a girl like me<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
Swizz told me let the beat rock<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
For all my Southside niggas that know me best<br/>
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex<br/>
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)<br/>
I made that bitch famous<br/>
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West<br/>
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best<br/>
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)<br/>
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)<br/>
Her man in the store tryna try his best<br/>
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh<br/>
But we still hood famous (God damn)<br/>
Yeah we still hood famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna &amp; Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
I loved you better than your own kin did<br/>
From the very start<br/>
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free<br/>
Wake up, Mr West! Oh, he's up!<br/>
I just wanted you to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'<br/>
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'<br/>
She in school to be a real estate agent<br/>
Last month I helped her with the car payment<br/>
Young and we alive, whoo!<br/>
We never gonna die, whoo!<br/>
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt<br/>
Put one up in the sky<br/>
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!<br/>
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!<br/>
No matter how hard they try, whoo!<br/>
We never gonna die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>

<i>[Nina Simone:]</i><br/>
