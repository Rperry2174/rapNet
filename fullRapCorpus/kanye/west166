As I lay me down to sleep<br/>
I hear her speak to me<br/>
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?<br/>
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'<br/>
I know you're happy, cause I can see it<br/>
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it<br/>
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel<br/>
And look at all that he gave you<br/>
You asked for one and you got two<br/>
You know I never left you<br/>
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right aside you<br/>
So I can say<br/>
<br/>
Hello my only one<br/>
Just like the morning sun<br/>
You keep on rising till the sky knows your name<br/>
Hello my only one<br/>
Remember who you are<br/>
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day<br/>
Remember how I'd say, hey, hey, one day<br/>
You'll be the man you always knew you could be<br/>
And if you knew how proud I was<br/>
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear<br/>
No you wouldn't do that<br/>
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page<br/>
I know it's not the end every time I see her face<br/>
And I hear you say<br/>
<br/>
Hello my only one<br/>
Remember who you are<br/>
You got the world cause you got the love in your hands<br/>
And you're still my chosen one<br/>
So can you understand<br/>
One day you'll understand<br/>
<br/>
So hear me out, hear me out<br/>
I won't go, I won't go<br/>
No goodbyes, no goodbyes<br/>
Just hello, just hello<br/>
And when you cry, I will cry<br/>
And when you smile, I will smile<br/>
And next time when I look in your eyes<br/>
We'll have wings and we'll fly<br/>
<br/>
Hello my only one<br/>
Just like the morning sun<br/>
You keep on rising till the sky knows your name<br/>
And you're still my chosen one<br/>
Remember who you are<br/>
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori<br/>
I just want you to do me a favor<br/>
<br/>
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me<br/>
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me<br/>
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me<br/>
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me<br/>
Tell Nori about me...
