<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Damn your lips very soft<br/>
As I turn my Blackberry off<br/>
And I turn your bath water on<br/>
And you turn off your iPhone<br/>
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass<br/>
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass<br/>
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash<br/>
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last<br/>
Thank God almighty, they free at last<br/>
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast<br/>
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas<br/>
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass<br/>
Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost<br/>
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce<br/>
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off<br/>
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Agent Sasco:]</i><br/>
That's all them can do (say wah, say wah)<br/>
That's all them can do<br/>
We deal with action thing<br/>
Just a badman thing a dat dem cab do<br/>
Action thing yo a badman thing<br/>
<br/>
Man a badman you fi know say<br/>
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose<br/>
Try that 'pon February the 30th<br/>
That's hard, couldn't try that no day<br/>
When we roll round 'pon your block<br/>
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like a aerosol can)<br/>
When we roll round 'pon your block<br/>
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like an aerosol can)<br/>
We ago smile pan court day<br/>
Because we beat murder charge like O.J<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Justin Vernon:]</i><br/>
That's right I'm in it (Should've known I would fall)<br/>
I'm in it (Stepping on tacks on the floor)<br/>
That's right (And boys at your door)<br/>
That's right I'm in it (Well you need to fight for your own)<br/>
That's right I'm in it (Then don't let me at your table)<br/>
I'm in it (If you just gonna lay there)<br/>
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars<br/>
I'll be gone long, grab that  <i>[?]</i> set your  <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Picked up where we left off<br/>
I need you home when I get off<br/>
You know I need that wet mouth<br/>
I know you need that reptile<br/>
She cut from a different textile<br/>
She love different kinds of sex now<br/>
Black girl sippin' white wine<br/>
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign<br/>
And grabbed it with a slight grind<br/>
And held it 'til the right time<br/>
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!<br/>
<br/>
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)<br/>
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)<br/>
Lay it off, it off, it off.<br/>
Star fucker,<br/>
Star fucker,<br/>
Star fucker,<br/>
Who? Where?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Time to take it too far now<br/>
Michael Douglas out the car now<br/>
The kids and the wife life<br/>
But can't wake up from the night life<br/>
I'm so scared of my demons<br/>
I go to sleep with a nightlight<br/>
My mind move like a Tron bike<br/>
Pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist<br/>
I'm gonna start a new movement<br/>
Being led by the drums<br/>
I'm a rap-lic priest<br/>
Getting head by the nuns<br/>
They don't play what I'm playing<br/>
They don't see what I'm saying<br/>
They be balling in the D-League<br/>
I be speaking Swaghili
