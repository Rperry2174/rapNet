<i>[Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
This is something special<br/>
This is something new<br/>
This is something special<br/>
This is something new<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson]</i><br/>
Lord Lord Lord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
The power of observation<br/>
marvells and frights, its strange delights<br/>
attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties<br/>
ecstatic patterns in the calender design<br/>
wilderness tours guided by and for the blind<br/>
cool rulers standing still sweating through the shade<br/>
who knew those lights only grew bright to fame<br/>
dead wrong pageantry lottery and games<br/>
slight of hand provided by extravagant and fake<br/>
the carnival till bell will hustle for the age<br/>
they clutch what they covet but what must they give away<br/>
who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay<br/>
surprise it's your life its your business anyway so please<br/>
pardonly and such curious minds<br/>
peace safe passage, precious time<br/>
hither and gone, the day of days<br/>
(?) this tiny stone illuminated by a star far gone<br/>
only star so large, many more<br/>
to make our largest star show small<br/>
furthermore the end is not the end no stop but I'm pausing<br/>
what we can witness is all that isn't all<br/>
(?) scotch and pork chops<br/>
the passion, expansion the order of the random<br/>
see the dreamers see the sleepers<br/>
(?) sweet jesus and life on Earth<br/>
seek heaven first<br/>
let put in this work<br/>
<br/>

This is something new<br/>

<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Her heels set the mood<br/>
where did you acquire those are liars<br/>
when I met you I heard Jesus bells, strings and a choir<br/>
I got lines better than niggas albums, plural<br/>
king of the urban make your shit sound rural<br/>
she said I hit it so deep she need an epidural<br/>
them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel<br/>
and thats nuts, I only hang around with white boys that like black sluts<br/>
tell em Plain Pat yo that track sucks<br/>
we aint dissin' you between the position you play something for us to listen to<br/>
I'm tryin' to worry about my scratch minus the crabs<br/>
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs<br/>
i got scripts so why we need a movie<br/>
and if I'm a douche than put me in your coochie<br/>
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loosely<br/>
and excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies<br/>
boobie trap, holla back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
AK on the lap like whats that<br/>
clik clak<br/>
this is something special<br/>
this is something new<br/>
All white Bentley I call that momma<br/>
my life crazy like Obama's<br/>
you talk slick well I'm Osama<br/>
Bin Laden, whats happenin' I get it crackin'<br/>
all black carpet, Ima rich yeah<br/>
its gonna take you a couple years to get this here<br/>
thank AP while they thank me<br/>
and I'd be mad too if you aint me<br/>
call me Mr D's or Mister boss<br/>
see me riding clean in a Rolls Royce<br/>
niggas talking funny that's old money<br/>
niggas looking crazy but they acting funny<br/>
nowadays rappers, they like bloggers<br/>
you see me I'ma a bank (?)<br/>
coming through your hood and I brings trucks<br/>
with 25's on it like what the fuck<br/>
hundred feet and better why they fuck you stick<br/>
paparzzi on the water, why the fuck you stick<br/>
my face got the fuck you pricks<br/>
my beats go hard like fuck you dicks<br/>
pourin' champagne damn thing<br/>
sit there rockin' sway nigga in the damn ring<br/>
aint a damn thing, money aint a damn thing<br/>
ask Yeezy and most we do the god damn thing<br/>
get down to the precious lovers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raekwon]</i><br/>
Ayo open glass on my fingers<br/>
I sit back like I'm caged but still cakin'<br/>
my niggas is hatin'<br/>
it's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood<br/>
you a piece of steak I'd rather be that than some bacon<br/>
every project is a throne, only just bigger stones they throw<br/>
that why I wear a big hat and roll weed<br/>
gone if you don't know where you came or when you came<br/>
all you know is weed and cocaine<br/>
non believers no game<br/>
I'm zooted down, rollin' a spliff<br/>
maxin' flamin' like wheres the attraction<br/>
I'm son he's attracted<br/>
guaranteed to service the real niggas<br/>
or cruisin' in a Volvo<br/>
duffy for dolo<br/>
puffy polo<br/>
that blow house is where I reside<br/>
live amongst fiends, countin' currency hittin' blunts<br/>
only to hear the door rumble<br/>
grab the four hope it aint the law<br/>
or maybe some nigga tryna score<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson]</i><br/>
Lord Lord Lord<br/>
Lord Lord Lord<br/>
Lord Lord Lord<br/>
