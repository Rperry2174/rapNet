<i>[Tony Williams and Kanye West:]</i><br/>
All of the lights<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
Lights<br/>
All of the lights<br/>

<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
Turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this<br/>

<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Something wrong<br/>
I hold my head<br/>
MJ gone, our nigga dead!<br/>
I slapped my girl, she called the feds<br/>
I did that time and spent that bread<br/>
I'm heading home, I'm almost there<br/>
I'm on my way heading up the stairs<br/>
To my surprise a nigga replacing me<br/>
I had to take him to that ghetto university<br/>
<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
Cop lights, flashlights, spot lights<br/>
Strobe lights, street lights<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
Fast life, drug life<br/>
Thug life, rock life<br/>
Every night<br/>
(all of the lights)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
Turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this<br/>
Turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
You know what I need<br/>
Want you to see everything<br/>
Want you to see all of the lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Restraining order<br/>
Can't see my daughter<br/>
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order<br/>
Public visitation<br/>
We met at Borders<br/>
Told her she take me back<br/>
I'll be more supportive<br/>
I made mistakes<br/>
I bumped my head<br/>
Courts sucked me dry<br/>
I spent that bread<br/>
She need a daddy<br/>
Baby, please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university<br/>
<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
Cop lights, flashlights, spot lights<br/>
Strobe lights, street lights<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
All of the lights<br/>
Fast life, drug life<br/>
Thug life, rock life<br/>
Every night<br/>
(all of the lights)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
Turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this<br/>
Turn up the lights in here, baby<br/>
You know what I need<br/>
Want you to see everything<br/>
Want you to see all of the lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Getting mine, baby<br/>
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah<br/>
Get it right, ay<br/>
You should go and get your own<br/>

<i>[Fergie:]</i><br/>
Unemployment line, credit card declined<br/>

And also was about to do that line<br/>
