Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?<br/>
Can they, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall<br/>
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all<br/>
Through the fire, through whatever come what may<br/>
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all away<br/>
Right down through the wire, even through the fire<br/>
<br/>
I spit it through the wire man<br/>
There's too much stuff on my heart right now man<br/>
I'll gladly risk it all right now<br/>
It's a life or death situation man<br/>
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man<br/>
It's your boy Kanye to the...<br/>
Chi-Town what's going on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dessert<br/>
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp<br/>
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk<br/>
Not to worry Mr. H 2 the Izzo's back to wizzerk<br/>
How do you console my mom or give her light support?<br/>
Telling her your son's on life support<br/>
And just imagine how my girl feel<br/>
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till<br/>
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine<br/>
She a delta so she been throwing them Dynasty signs<br/>
No use me tryin' to be lyin'<br/>
I been trying to be signed<br/>
Trying to be a millionaire<br/>
How I use two lifelines<br/>
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died<br/>
The doctor said I had blood clots<br/>
But I ain't Jamaican man<br/>
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band<br/>
I swear this right here is history in the making man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I really apologize how I sound right now man<br/>
If it's unclear at all, man<br/>
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks<br/>
You know we had reconstru...<br/>
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw<br/>
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was in the back of my mouth man<br/>
I couldn't believe it<br/>
But I'm still here for you all right now yo<br/>
This is what I gotta say yo<br/>
Yeah, turn me up yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around<br/>
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word<br/>
Except he's really putting it down<br/>
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory<br/>
And what we need to do in the game<br/>
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time<br/>
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed<br/>
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mace felt<br/>
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt<br/>
I swear to God driver two wanna sue<br/>
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe<br/>
My dawgs couldn't tell if I<br/>
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised<br/>
There's been an accident like GEICO<br/>
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael<br/>
I must gotta angel<br/>
Cause look how death missed his ass<br/>
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass<br/>
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past<br/>
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash<br/>
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid<br/>
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did<br/>
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph<br/>
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Know what I'm saying<br/>
When the doctor told me I had a um..  I was going to have a plate on my chin<br/>
I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now<br/>
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on<br/>
Can't be serious man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus repeats till fade]</i>
