<br/>
My big brother was Big's brother<br/>
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother<br/>
Who was hip hop brother<br/>
Who was No I.D friend<br/>
No I.D My mentor<br/>
Now let the story begin<br/>
<br/>
Its the hard knock life tour<br/>
Sell out, picture us in the mall<br/>
Coping iceberg and yell out Jigga<br/>
Yea that's what we would yell out<br/>
Yell out<br/>
You know the name dude<br/>
I gotta spell out or tell bout<br/>
J a y an Ye so shy<br/>
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi<br/>
Standing there like a mime<br/>
Let the chance pass by<br/>
Back of my mind he could change your life<br/>
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it<br/>
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig<br/>
But he got me out my mama crib<br/>
Then he help me get my mama a crib<br/>
<br/>
Big brother was Bigs Brother<br/>
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother<br/>
Who was hip hop brother<br/>
Who was No I.D friend<br/>
No I.D my mentor<br/>
Now let the story begin<br/>
Let the story begin<br/>
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands<br/>
<br/>
Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline<br/>
Nothing handed out<br/>
I'm about to take mine<br/>
Around the same time of that BluePrint 1<br/>
Any beats in my pocket was that Blueprint form<br/>
I'd play my little song in that old back room<br/>
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you<br/>
But by the Black album I was blacking out<br/>
Party at S.O.Bs and we had packed the crowd<br/>
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square<br/>
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there<br/>
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it<br/>
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets<br/>
I guess big brother was thinking a little different<br/>
Kept little brother at bay, at a distance<br/>
Put everything I felt was more focused<br/>
Only made me more focused<br/>
Only wrote more potent<br/>
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over<br/>
I guess ill understand when I get more older<br/>
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the todum<br/>
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrodum<br/>
<br/>
My big Brother was Bigs brother<br/>
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother<br/>
Who was hip hops brother<br/>
Who was No I.Ds friend<br/>
No I.D my mentor<br/>
Now let the story begin<br/>
Begin<br/>
Let the story begin<br/>
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant<br/>
Not only a client the presidito<br/>
Hola ovito<br/>
The game getting foul so here's a free throw<br/>
I was always on the other side of the peep hole<br/>
Then I dropped Jesus walks now I'm on a steep hole<br/>
And we know<br/>
New jack city gotta keep my brother<br/>
But to be number 1 I'm a beat my brother<br/>
On that diamond remix I swore I spaz<br/>
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass<br/>
Sibling rivery, only I could see<br/>
It was the pride in me that was driving me<br/>
At the Grammies I said I inspired me<br/>
But my big brother who I always tried to be<br/>
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll<br/>
Cause even if he gave me the rock its give and go<br/>
I guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk<br/>
And my shit was more like a finger roll<br/>
but I had them singles though<br/>
And them hoes at the show gonna minggle yo.<br/>
Ya know<br/>
I told Jay I did a song with cold play<br/>
Next thing I know he got a song with coldplay<br/>
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way<br/>
Translate espanol<br/>
No way Jose<br/>
Then I went and told Jay brown<br/>
Should of known that was gonna come back around<br/>
Should of told you like a man should of told you first<br/>
But I told somebody else that's what made shit worse<br/>
<br/>
My big brother was Bigs brother<br/>
So here's a few words from your kid brother<br/>
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um<br/>
People never get the flowers while they could smell um<br/>
A ideal in my eyes, God of the game<br/>
Heart of the city,Rockafella chain<br/>
Never be the same, never be another<br/>
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother<br/>
<br/>
My big Brother was Bigs brother<br/>
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother<br/>
Who was hip hops brother<br/>
Who was No I.Ds friend<br/>
No I.D my mentor<br/>
And that's where the story ends<br/>
<br/>
Don't kill this shit.....
