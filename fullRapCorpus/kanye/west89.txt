<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Hello, can I speak to a, a, yeah you know who you are<br/>
Look, you had no idea what ya dealing with<br/>
Something on some of this realest shit<br/>
Something, something<br/>
Yeah. thats my bitch<br/>
<br/>
Thats my bitch<br/>
Sh-shorty right there<br/>
Thats my bitch<br/>
Thats my bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Elly Jackson:]</i><br/>
I've been waiting for a long long time<br/>
Just to get off and throw my hands up high<br/>
And live my life<br/>
And live my life<br/>
Just to get off and throw my hands up high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I paid for them titties, get your own<br/>
It aint safe in the city, watch the throne<br/>
You say I care more about them basquion's, basquiats<br/>
She learning a new word, its yacht<br/>
Blew the World up as soon as I hit the club with her<br/>
Too Short called, told me "I fell in love with her"<br/>
Seen by actors, ball players and drug dealers<br/>
And some lesbians that never loved niggas<br/>
Twisted love story True Romance<br/>
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance<br/>
I'm a freak huh, rock star life<br/>
The second girl with us, thats our wife<br/>
Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle<br/>
Who's the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle<br/>
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle<br/>
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Elly Jackson:]</i><br/>
I've been waiting for a long long time<br/>
Just to get off and throw my hands up high<br/>
And live my life<br/>
And live my life<br/>
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high<br/>
<br/>
Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning<br/>
Not swerving, oh, yeah<br/>
Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion<br/>
Stop motion, ooh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Go harder than a nigga for a nigga go figure<br/>
Told me "keep my own money" if we ever did split up<br/>
How can somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?<br/>
With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers<br/>
Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her<br/>
Thats right nigga Mona Lisa can't fade her<br/>
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice<br/>
But why all the pretty icons always all white<br/>
Back to my Beyonces<br/>
You deserve 3 stacks for the Andre<br/>
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums<br/>
You belong in Vintage clothes watching the whole building<br/>
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing<br/>
You too dope for any of those civilians<br/>
Now shoot trigga, stop looking at her tits<br/>
Get ya own dog, ya heard<br/>
Thats my bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I've been waiting for a long long time<br/>
Just to get off and throw my hands up high<br/>
And live my life<br/>
And live my life<br/>
Just to get off and throw my hands up high<br/>
<br/>
Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning<br/>
Not swerving, oh, yeah<br/>
Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion<br/>
Stop motion, ooh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
You have no idea what you're dealing with<br/>
Something on some of this realest shit<br/>
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth<br/>
Something, something, yeah<br/>
<br/>
That's my bitch, That's my bitch<br/>
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch<br/>
That's my bitch
