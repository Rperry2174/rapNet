<i>[Intro: Justin Vernon]</i><br/>
I can hold my liquor<br/>
This man can't handle me<br/>
But this man can't handle his weed<br/>
On Chicago, south of town<br/>
I'm on in Indiana<br/>
I'm heard on the radio now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chief Keef]</i><br/>
I can't handle no liquor<br/>
But these bitches can't handle me<br/>
I can't control my niggas<br/>
And my niggas they can't control me<br/>
You say you know me, my nigga<br/>
But you really just know the old me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm back out my coma, waking up on your sofa<br/>
When I park my Range Rover, slightly scratch your Corolla<br/>
Okay, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hanging on a hangover<br/>
Five years we been over, ask me why I came over<br/>
One more hit and I can own ya, one more fuck and I can own ya<br/>
One cold night in October, pussy had me floating<br/>
Feel like Deepak Chopra, pussy had me dead<br/>
Might call 2Pac over, Yeezy's all on you sofa, these the red Octobers<br/>
Still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when I ain't sober<br/>
You love me when I'm hungover, even when I blow doja<br/>
Then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders<br/>
Tellin' you that I'm bogus, bitch you don't even know us<br/>
Baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner<br/>
Late night organ donor, after that he disown ya<br/>
After that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless<br/>
When he's sober it's over and bitch, I'm back out my coma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge + Hook]</i><br/>
I can't handle no liquor<br/>
But these bitches can't handle me<br/>
I can't control my niggas<br/>
And my niggas they can't control me<br/>
You say you know me, my nigga<br/>
But you really just know the old me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Justin Vernon and Kanye West]</i><br/>
I heard you need a new fad<br/>
I heard you need a new stack<br/>
I heard you need a new phone<br/>
I know your 'rents ain't be home<br/>
Callin' up your uncle's place<br/>
Shit's all over the place<br/>
I don't hear your phone<br/>
Ohhh on the phone
