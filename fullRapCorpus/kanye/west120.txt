<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bound to fall in love<br/>
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now<br/>
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown<br/>
Bound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bound to fall in love<br/>
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?<br/>
She say she only here for her girl birthday<br/>
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty<br/>
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty<br/>
I know I got a bad reputation<br/>
Walking 'round, always mad reputation<br/>
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation<br/>
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation<br/>
I turned the nightclub out of the basement<br/>
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining<br/>
How you gon' be mad on vacation?<br/>
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans<br/>
Uh, this that prom shit<br/>
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit<br/>
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit<br/>
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
I know you're tired of loving, of loving<br/>
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures<br/>
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches<br/>
Bound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bound to fall in love<br/>
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink<br/>
After that, give you something to drink<br/>
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink<br/>
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?<br/>
Hey, you remember where we first met?<br/>
Okay, I don't remember where we first met<br/>
But hey, admitting is the first step<br/>
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect<br/>
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep<br/>
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect<br/>
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving<br/>
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas<br/>
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist<br/>
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?<br/>
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps<br/>
But first, you gon' remember how to forget<br/>
After all these long-ass verses<br/>
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
I know you're tired of loving, of loving<br/>
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody<br/>
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party<br/>
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth<br/>
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth<br/>
Bound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bound to fall in love<br/>
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
