<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[John Mayer:]</i><br/>
Bittersweet<br/>
You're gonna be the death of me<br/>
I don't want you, but I need you<br/>
I love you and hate you at the very same time<br/>
Bittersweet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad<br/>
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says<br/>
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says<br/>
God talk to me now, this is an emergency<br/>
And she claim she only with me for the currency<br/>
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery<br/>
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me<br/>
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely<br/>
We breaking up again, we making up again<br/>
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then<br/>
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?<br/>
And you mix them emotions with tequila<br/>
And you mix that with a little bad advice<br/>
On one of those bad nights, ya'll have a bad fight<br/>
And you talking 'bout her family, her aunts and shit<br/>
And she say "Motherfucker, yo momma's a bitch!"<br/>
You know, domestic drama and shit, all that attitude<br/>
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you!<br/>
But I'mma be the bigger man, Big Pimpin' like Jiggaman<br/>
Oh I guess I figure it's...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad<br/>
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says<br/>
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says<br/>
God talk to me now, this is an emergency<br/>
And my nigga said I shouldn't let it worry me<br/>
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently<br/>
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking and<br/>
This relationship it even got me back to drinking all this<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
It's gonna be the death of me<br/>
And I always thought that you having our child was our destiny<br/>
But I can't even vibe with you sexually<br/>
Cuz every time I would try, you would question me<br/>
Saying "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me?<br/>
You don't see how ya lies is affecting me.<br/>
You don't see how our life was supposed to be.<br/>
And I never let a nigga get that close to me.<br/>
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be.<br/>
You always gone, you'll always be where them hoes'll be."<br/>
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye:]</i><br/>
I fucked up and I know it g<br/>
I guess it's bittersweet poetry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x2]</i><br/>
See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad<br/>
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says<br/>
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says<br/>
God talk to me now, this is an emergency<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
