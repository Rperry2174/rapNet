You keep it going man, you keep those books rolling,<br/>
You pick up those books your going to read<br/>
And not remember and you roll man.<br/>
You get that a sociate degree, okay,<br/>
Then you get your bachelors, then you get your masters<br/>
Then you get your master's masters,<br/>
Then you get your doctron,<br/>
You go man, then when everybody says quit<br/>
You show them those degree man, when<br/>
Everybody says hey, your not working,<br/>
Your not making in money,<br/>
You say look at my degrees and you look at my life,<br/>
Yeah i'm 52, so what, hate all you want,<br/>
But i'm smart, i'm so smart, and i'm in school,<br/>
And these guys are out here making <br/>
Money all these ways, and i'm spended mine to be smart.<br/>
You know why?<br/>
Because when i die, buddy, you know<br/>
What going to keep me warm, that right, those degrees
