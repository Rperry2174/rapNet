<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Re-Up Gang Pusha<br/>
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)<br/>
But you found it muthafucker<br/>
Yes<br/>
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses<br/>
shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses<br/>
never let jail turn my shine into Moses<br/>
couldn’t cleanse my soul with them civil rights sposes<br/>
panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster<br/>
backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur<br/>
killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her<br/>
Photo-op this priceless, frame our wanted posters<br/>
the audacity, war brings casualty<br/>
bitch have my son before I face that tragedy<br/>
ugh, I order hits, she orders mahi<br/>
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the shower posse<br/>
Gone!!!<br/>
<br/>
(You seek out problems)<br/>
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)<br/>
But you found it motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I’m here, it’s the misogyny<br/>
bad bitches massaging me<br/>
sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges<br/>
so please don’t judge me, ugh, for the following<br/>
fat bitches swallowing, skinny bitches modeling<br/>
take of that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy<br/>
I have your face looking all Captain Cruncy<br/>
the devil stay testing<br/>
’cause when you chase the pussy it’s a sin<br/>
but if it falls in your lap it’s a blessing<br/>
soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing<br/>
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive<br/>
had used the main leathers (leathers, leathers, leathers)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cyhi The Prynce:]</i><br/>
Cyhi, Cyhi, Yeah<br/>
boy, we looking for trouble<br/>
maybe if we wasn’t black then we wouldn’t have struggled<br/>
player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle<br/>
they cook and I smuggle<br/>
got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle<br/>
so I’m running through them circles,<br/>
boy I’m looking like Knuckles<br/>
look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking<br/>
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog I’m good for a scuffle<br/>
don’t be mad I whooped your ass ’cause I’ve tooken a couple<br/>
feds asking niggas questions but I wouldn’t rebuttal<br/>
‘cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble<br/>
with a tall model broad like I took her from Russell<br/>
didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle<br/>
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts<br/>
ain’t nothing silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh<br/>
but now I’m eating off of rather yellow gold<br/>
exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes<br/>
but don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows<br/>
‘cause all my Titos got bricks like a yellow road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
GOOD, I do it<br/>
B.I.G. Sean Don nigga<br/>
(But you found it mutherfucker)<br/>
bitch<br/>
I’m in, that no-smoke sec’ rolling motherfucking ounces<br/>
marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing<br/>
three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers<br/>
nothing less than a G stack’s in my trousers<br/>
(Boy)<br/>
new double-D’s smashed in her blouses<br/>
fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)<br/>
my nigga, we rent houses<br/>
so many wedding rings lost in them couches<br/>
I’m just a Westside lover<br/>
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber<br/>
this is showtime, showtime, boy<br/>
I hope you set the DVR<br/>
stacking money face to face, dish it, look like CPR<br/>
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne<br/>
so now I’m snapping like yo’ ass just finished a poem<br/>
does he sound like ‘Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake?<br/>
meanwhile, I’m chilling with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t<br/>
consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime<br/>
a killer before the crime, a BIG before the Dime<br/>
greet me wit a middle finger when you see me<br/>
it’s cool, ’cause I can’t see yo’ ass from this side of the TV muthafucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole]</i><br/>
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one<br/>
what you now hear is putting fear in all the older ones<br/>
down played me to downgrade me like they don’t notice son<br/>
your shoes too big too fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em<br/>
fucking hoes while teaching niggas to hold your sons<br/>
this the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son<br/>
high as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun<br/>
never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one<br/>
heard you looking for trouble, what, I’m supposed to run?<br/>
yo’ bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I supposed to cum?<br/>
got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one<br/>
now you outside of heaven’s gate, fronting like you know someone<br/>
talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me<br/>
they say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy<br/>
fuck it, everybody can get it<br/>
when you’re this hot, everybody’s a critic<br/>
but when you’re this high everybody’s a midget<br/>
all this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothing<br/>
could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?<br/>
went from quarter to broke to half past rich<br/>
with my badass bitch<br/>
and you don’t want no problems on some math class shit<br/>
so check the young genius out<br/>
fuck the World, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout<br/>
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ’bout<br/>
what you been praying for? What you been screaming ’bout?<br/>
ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming ’bout
