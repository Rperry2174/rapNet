<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Whose fault?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more<br/>
Let's play the blame game for sure.<br/>
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more.<br/>
Let's call out names, names, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call you bitch for short as a last resort and my first resort.<br/>
You call me motherfucker for long,<br/>
At the end of it you know we both were wrong.<br/>
<br/>
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more.<br/>
Let's play the blame game for sure.<br/>
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more.<br/>
Let's call out names, names, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
On a bathroom wall I wrote<br/>
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else."<br/>
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and I went and found somebody else<br/>
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings, yo I'd rather be by my fucking self<br/>
'Til about 2 AM and I call back and I hang up and I start to blame myself<br/>
Somebody help<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Let's play the blame game, I love you more<br/>
Let's play the blame game for sure.<br/>
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more.<br/>
Let's call her names, names for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it<br/>
Stick around, some real feelings might surface<br/>
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up fuckin' and choking you<br/>
What the hell was I supposed to do<br/>
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude<br/>
And if you are I hope you have a good time<br/>
'Cause I definitely be having mine<br/>
<br/>
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional<br/>
Every time I hear bout other nigga's stroking you<br/>
Lying, say I hit you,<br/>
He sitting there consoling you<br/>
Running my name through the mud<br/>
Who's provoking you<br/>
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you<br/>
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you<br/>
1 A.M. and can't nobody get a hold of you<br/>
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do<br/>
Even though I knew, he never told the truth<br/>
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to<br/>
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions<br/>
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers<br/>
I heard he bought some coke with my money<br/>
That ain't right girl<br/>
You getting blackmailed for that white girl<br/>
You always said Yeezy I ain't your right girl<br/>
You probably find one of them "I like art"–type girls<br/>
All of her life, she was caught in the hype girl<br/>
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie<br/>
Then who to blame, you to blame, me to blame<br/>
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained<br/>
Let's play the blame game...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more<br/>
Let's play the blame game for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
"Things used to be, now they're not<br/>
Anything but us is who we are<br/>
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers<br/>
We've become public enemies<br/>
We walk away like strangers in the street<br/>
Gone for eternity<br/>
We erased one another<br/>
So far from where we came<br/>
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing<br/>
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E<br/>
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely."<br/>
―Chloe Mitchell<br/>
<br/>
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more<br/>
Let's play the blame game for sure.<br/>
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more.<br/>
Let's call out names, names, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I can't love you this much<br/>
I can't love you this much<br/>
I can't love you this much<br/>
I can't love you this much<br/>
I can't love you this much<br/>
No, I can't love you this much<br/>
I can't love you this much<br/>
I can't love you this much<br/>
<br/>
And I know that you were somewhere doing your thing<br/>
And when the phone called it just rang and rang<br/>
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back<br/>
And I heard the whole thing.<br/>
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing...<br/>
<br/>
<i>["The Best Birthday" Chris Rock:]</i><br/>
Oh my God<br/>
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfucking level<br/>
Now a neighbourhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this<br/>
God damn, God damn! Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?<br/>
(Yeezy taught me)<br/>
You never used to talk dirty, but now you—you got damn disgusting,<br/>
My—my God, where—where'd you learn that?<br/>
(Yeezy taught me)<br/>
Look at you motherfucking butt ass naked with them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on<br/>
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?<br/>
(Yeezy taught me)<br/>
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level, this is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit!<br/>
You done went all porno on a nigga, OK. And I, and I love it.<br/>
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!<br/>
How d'you learn, how—how did your pussy game come up?<br/>
(Yeezy taught me)<br/>
I was fucking parts of your pussy I've never fucked before<br/>
I was in there like, "Oh, shit, I've never been here before." I've never even seen this part of pussy town before.<br/>
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?<br/>
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?<br/>
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)<br/>
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy.<br/>
And when I see that nigga I'mma thank him.<br/>
I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker I'mma shoot a bootlegger!<br/>
That's how good I feel about this nigga<br/>
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch. This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted<br/>
Even with the bezel this is the motherfucker I wanted. I saw this shit, I saw that Twista had this shit on in The Source. I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source<br/>
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!<br/>
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?<br/>
(Yeezy taught me)<br/>
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well.
