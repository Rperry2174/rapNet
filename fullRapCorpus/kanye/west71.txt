<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it<br/>
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me<br/>
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying<br/>
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down<br/>
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it<br/>
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me<br/>
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus<br/>
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances<br/>
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn<br/>
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'<br/>
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin<br/>
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums<br/>
Based off the way we was branded<br/>
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon<br/>
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random<br/>
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage<br/>
I need a happy ending and a new beginning<br/>
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative<br/>
<br/>
This the real world, homie, school finished<br/>
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it<br/>
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS<br/>
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it<br/>
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me<br/>
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying<br/>
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?<br/>
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing<br/>
But this is more than just my road to redemption<br/>
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention<br/>
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me<br/>
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me<br/>
<br/>
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me<br/>
If a nigga ain't shooting a jump shot running a track meet<br/>
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus<br/>
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics<br/>
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish<br/>
Choke a South Park writer with a fish stick<br/>
I insisted to get up offa this dick<br/>
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it<br/>
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted<br/>
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it<br/>
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me<br/>
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying<br/>
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I need more drinks and less lights<br/>
And that American Apparel girl in just tights<br/>
She told the director she tryna get into school<br/>
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool."<br/>
It's been a while since I watched the tube<br/>
'Cause like a crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news."<br/>
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today<br/>
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday<br/>
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach<br/>
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach<br/>
My God said I need a different approach<br/>
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke<br/>
It's not funny anymore try different jokes<br/>
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o<br/>
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it<br/>
Play strings for the dramatic<br/>
Ending of that wack shit<br/>
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes<br/>
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it<br/>
I'm coming after whoever who has it<br/>
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic<br/>
That y'all, it's like that ya'll<br/>
I don't really give a fuck about it at all<br/>
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me<br/>
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it<br/>
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me<br/>
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying<br/>
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raekwon:]</i><br/>
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid<br/>
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes<br/>
Counting up, smoking, one cuff<br/>
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it<br/>
Steam about a hundred and one Ls<br/>
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson<br/>
Nigga hat game was special<br/>
It matched every black pair of Nikes<br/>
Throwing dice for decimals<br/>
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head<br/>
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead<br/>
That meant code red<br/>
Bent off the black skunk<br/>
The black dutch, back of the old shed<br/>
If you can't live, you dying<br/>
You give or buy in<br/>
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding<br/>
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan<br/>
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it<br/>
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me<br/>
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus<br/>
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
