Dirt and grime and filth inside<br/>
The story of my lifetime<br/>
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling<br/>
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother<br/>
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are<br/>
(Perfect!)<br/>
<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman<br/>
(Yo!)<br/>
<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished<br/>
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers<br/>
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it<br/>
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!<br/>
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!<br/>
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days<br/>
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away<br/>
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon<br/>
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)<br/>
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive<br/>
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?<br/>
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham<br/>
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!<br/>
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days<br/>
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised<br/>
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves<br/>
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!)<br/>
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)<br/>
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!)<br/>
I done wore designers I won't wear again<br/>
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant<br/>
<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman<br/>
(Sonic boom!)<br/>
<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury<br/>
I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!<br/>
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?<br/>
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!<br/>
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute<br/>
(We did)<br/>
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!<br/>
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?<br/>
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo!)<br/>
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo!)<br/>
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)<br/>
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion<br/>
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)<br/>
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house<br/>
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo<br/>
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel<br/>
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?<br/>
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)<br/>
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home<br/>
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone<br/>
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?<br/>
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2<br/>
Timbuck2, Timbuck2<br/>
<br/>
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are<br/>
(Perfect!)
