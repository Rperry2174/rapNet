I brought you brothers here to start our own fraternity<br/>
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it.<br/>
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it)<br/>
No, we have no money <br/>
We are sharin' jeans.<br/>
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on.<br/>
How many cars do we own? (None!)<br/>
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!)<br/>
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car?<br/>
Yes, we will.<br/>
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!<br/>
(We can't afford no gas!)<br/>
Say it!<br/>
(We can't afford no gas!)<br/>
So we ain't drivin'!
