<i>[King Louie:]</i><br/>
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis<br/>
M.O.B, she call me selfish<br/>
Success got 'em jealous<br/>
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling<br/>
Tattoos, how they break the news<br/>
It was real if you made the news<br/>
Last night my bitches came in twos<br/>
And they both suck like they came to lose<br/>
Dropped out the first day of school<br/>
Cause niggas got cocaine to move<br/>
I be going hard, I got a name to prove<br/>
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve<br/>
<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>

<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
This the greatest shit in the club<br/>
Since "In Da Club"<br/>
It's so packed I might ride around<br/>
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club<br/>
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"<br/>
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"<br/>
If not, treat your friends like my Benz<br/>
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end<br/>
When I go raw, I like to leave it in<br/>
When I wake up, I like to go again<br/>
When I go to work, she gotta call it in<br/>
She can't go to work, same clothes again<br/>
And her heart colder than the souls of men<br/>
Louboutin on the toes again<br/>
Tight dress dancing close to him<br/>
Yeezus just rose again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Louie:]</i><br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beenie Man:]</i><br/>
Memories don't live like people do<br/>
They always 'member you<br/>
Whether things are good or bad<br/>
It's just the memories that you have
