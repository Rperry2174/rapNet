Yeah, I see you waitin' over there<br/>
See you jockin' over there<br/>
See you lookin' at my girl over here<br/>
Why you worried 'bout this girl over here?<br/>
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare<br/>
Turn my head and hey<br/>
I see you waitin' over there<br/>
I see you jockin' over there<br/>
Thinkin' bout your own life<br/>
Why you talkin' 'bout the young, you dig?<br/>
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right<br/>
And they think they know and they think they know<br/>
They deal it for real<br/>
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right<br/>
And they think they know, and they think they know<br/>
They deal it for real<br/>
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo<br/>
<br/>
I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix<br/>
I don't need a bitch trying to take my mind off my grip<br/>
If I had one wish it'd be to have more wishes, duh<br/>
Fuck tryna make it rhyme, throw them stones, with your bitch ass<br/>
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed I stand alone<br/>
Alone I'll be, heart of a lion still shining on your sucka ass<br/>
Work it, work it, work it, for inner peace<br/>
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech<br/>
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin' on so many pills<br/>
Hah, they figured that they know a nigga<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I see you waitin' over there<br/>
See you jockin' over there<br/>
See you lookin' at my girl over here<br/>
Why you worried 'bout this girl over here?<br/>
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare<br/>
Turn my head and hey<br/>
I see you waitin' over there<br/>
I see you jockin' over there<br/>
Thinkin' bout your own life<br/>
Why you talkin' 'bout the young, you dig?<br/>
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right<br/>
And they think they know and they think they know<br/>
They deal it for real<br/>
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right<br/>
And they think they know, and they think they know<br/>
They deal it for real<br/>
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo
