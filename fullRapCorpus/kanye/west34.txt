<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and<br/>
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts<br/>
I take a sip of that yak, I wanna fuck<br/>
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck<br/>
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing<br/>
Towel under the door smoke until the days end<br/>
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation<br/>
Hpnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser<br/>
Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior<br/>
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper<br/>
High off the ground instead of skyscraper<br/>
Cool off thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major<br/>
<br/>
We major (come on, homie, we major) <i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon<br/>
Better than a chick that say yes to soon<br/>
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma<br/>
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.<br/>
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up<br/>
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up<br/>
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?<br/>
Get they first car and then IRS show up<br/>
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine<br/>
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine<br/>
Put two and two together in a little bad weather<br/>
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line<br/>
Ask the reverand was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school<br/>
That's all I want like wino's want they good whisky<br/>
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write<br/>
First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?<br/>
Four-four's or black christ? Both flows would be nice<br/>
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight<br/>
At the studio consol asked my man to the right<br/>
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?<br/>
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic<br/>
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel<br/>
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed<br/>
Now I'm a free agent<br/>
And I'm thinking it's time<br/>
To build my very own Motown<br/>
Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s<br/>
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life<br/>
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic<br/>
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt<br/>
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed<br/>
I survived the livest niggas around<br/>
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns<br/>
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took<br/>
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling better than I ever felt before today<br/>
Like better late than never is orientation<br/>
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away<br/>
<br/>
