<i>[Intro: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up<br/>
To the world, I made up in my mind<br/>
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight<br/>
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway<br/>
Let me say it one more time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up<br/>
To the world, to the world, to the world<br/>
To the world, to the world, to the world<br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up<br/>
Middle fingers up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
(Motherfucker)<br/>
Deuces minus one<br/>
Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)<br/>
The whole world is a couch<br/>
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)<br/>
Throw it up, throw it up<br/>
Cause you can't take it with you<br/>
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you<br/>
To the world, to the world<br/>
Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way,<br/>
Let's take it a notch up, take it up<br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!<br/>
To the world, I made up in my mind<br/>
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight<br/>
I'm doing things my way, it's my way or the highway<br/>
Let me see you one more time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up<br/>
To the world, to the world, to the world<br/>
To the world, to the world, to the world<br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up<br/>
Middle fingers up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Mmm ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador<br/>
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord<br/>
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score<br/>
This a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola<br/>
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that<br/>
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs<br/>
Like, "These niggas tryna hold me back<br/>
These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks<br/>
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax<br/>
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back<br/>
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?<br/>
"Ease up there baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that<br/>
R. Kelly and the God of rap<br/>
shitting on you, holy crap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up<br/>
To the world, to the world, to the world<br/>
To the world, to the world, to the world<br/>
Let me see you put your middle fingers up<br/>
Middle fingers up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Teyana Taylor]</i><br/>
I could give it all up, but it's not enough<br/>
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger<br/>
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon<br/>
Here's to the mountains, yeah here's to the room<br/>
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me<br/>
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me
