Yo Ferris, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?<br/>
I spit it through the wire, man<br/>
If this ain't dedication I don't know what is, man<br/>
Listen, first of all I want to thank you for your support<br/>
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah, feels like, uh, every sunshine is brighter<br/>
Sunsets feel righter<br/>
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer<br/>
Feel like God wrote this<br/>
I'm just here to quote this<br/>
I don't know if you notice but them accident pictures bogus<br/>
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?<br/>
I know I almost was the final destination<br/>
I must've had a blessin' from Pastor Mason<br/>
Cause that trip to L.A. could've been my last vacation<br/>
And, man, I know I can drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne<br/>
But, what, I went along with the plan<br/>
Paid for my own video, directed by my man<br/>
Man, I know God was holdin' my hand<br/>
Wouldn't let me go before I go on Def Poetry Jam<br/>
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throw in some vowels<br/>
'Bout what we goin' through now<br/>
Girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks<br/>
And since the accident they tellin' me it's the cheeks<br/>
And if you look at history<br/>
That last rapper that almost died sold 6.5<br/>
'Cept I'm comin' from the Chi<br/>
Through the wire to the wall<br/>
All my rhymes is raw<br/>
All these beats beats beats beats beats<br/>
All of them could of been lost<br/>
I always got to floss<br/>
I almost paid the cost<br/>
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep<br/>
Always thank the Lord<br/>
For this mic and my keyboard<br/>
Heck naw, that boy is raw<br/>
<br/>
You hear that? That's all that jewelry I got on man<br/>
Sometimes I take it off at the airport but I still get stopped<br/>
They be like "There go Kayne, there go Kayne!<br/>
Can I see some I.D. please? So thank you very much"<br/>
First of all, my momma named me Kanye so you all gonna' call me Kanye<br/>
I'm like the girl on the 'Sixth Sense'<br/>
"I'm feelin' much better now"<br/>
I feel a whole hell of a lot better man
