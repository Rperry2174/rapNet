All day, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Theophilus London:]</i><br/>
Dead, ayy, ayy ayy ayy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
How long you niggas ball? All day, nigga<br/>
How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga<br/>
How many runners do you got on call? All day, nigga<br/>
Swish, swish, how long they keep you in court? All day, nigga<br/>
Take you to get this fly? All day, nigga<br/>
Tell your P.O. how-how long you been high? All day, nigga<br/>
You already know I’m straight from the Chi, all day, nigga<br/>
South, south, south side! All day, nigga<br/>
<br/>
This Ye, nigga<br/>
Shoppin' for the winter, and it’s just May, nigga<br/>
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga<br/>
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures<br/>
For that Jesus piece, man, I've been saved, nigga<br/>
Just talked to Farrakhan, that's sensei, nigga<br/>
Told him I've been on ten since the 10th grade, nigga<br/>
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh<br/>
I don't let 'em play with me<br/>
I don't let 'em talk to me no kind of way<br/>
Uh, they better watch what they say to me<br/>
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day<br/>
Though I still got the 100 with the small face, nigga<br/>
Might spend 50 racks on my off day, nigga<br/>
You a fake Denzel like the Allstate nigga<br/>
If you run into me, better have Allstate with you, uh<br/>
You a Rico Suave, nigga<br/>
Ride around listening to Sade, nigga<br/>
If you ain't with us, you in our way, nigga<br/>
You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga<br/>
Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga<br/>
Your bitch got an ass, but my broad way thicker<br/>
Late for the class, in the hallway, nigga<br/>
Yeah, the dropout at it as always, nigga, as always<br/>
<br/>
All day, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Allan Kingdom:]</i><br/>
I took a deep sweet breath, and I reached into my head<br/>
Gave him what I had left<br/>
At that moment I dispersed<br/>
At that moment I dispersed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
All day, nigga<br/>
<br/>
How-h-how long you ball? All day, nigga<br/>
How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga<br/>
How long it take you to get this fly? All day, nigga<br/>
Tell your P.O. how-how long you been high? All day, nigga<br/>
Pour some Hen out for my niggas that died, all day, nigga<br/>
And I keep a bad bitch on the passenger side, all day, nigga<br/>
You already know that I’m straight from the Chi, all day, nigga<br/>
South, south, south side! All day, nigga<br/>
<br/>
I could do this all day, boy, I'm finna turn this bitch out<br/>
They need that Ye in the streets, boy, there's been a motherfucking drought<br/>
Don't really matter what I make, boy, you know I still go wild<br/>
Like a light skinned slave, boy, we in the mothafuckin' house<br/>
Right now, lookin' real sus right now<br/>
I swear I've been on this flight like a month right now<br/>
Stupid niggas gettin' money, Forrest Gump right now<br/>
Shout-out to Jackie Chan, I need to stunt right now<br/>
They've been lookin' at the Gram, I've been lookin' at the Grammys<br/>
Like, woo, that's us right now<br/>
24/7, 365 days, everybody gettin' paid<br/>
Niggas lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs<br/>
People saying, "Ye, Ye, take it easy"<br/>
20 Gs for the Yeezy's off of eBay<br/>
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit<br/>
Only way I can sum it up, son of a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Theophilius London:]</i><br/>
(Hands up, hands up)<br/>
Some want you dead, ayy, ayy ayy ayy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
All day, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Allan Kingdom:]</i><br/>
I took a deep sweet breath, and I reached into my head<br/>
Gave him what I had left<br/>
At that moment I dispersed<br/>
At that moment I dispersed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Get low, alright<br/>
Get low, alright<br/>
What up? Alright, alright<br/>
Stay low, alright<br/>
Stay low, alright<br/>
South, south, south side, all day nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Guitar Interlude: Paul McCartney]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Well, well, well<br/>
Let me run<br/>
Let me run to see who came undone<br/>
You've been right in my face<br/>
Let me run 'til you're off my case<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
