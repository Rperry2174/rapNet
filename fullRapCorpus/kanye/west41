<i>[Chorus: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that<br/>
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that<br/>
I'm comin in when I feel like<br/>
To turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right<br/>
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that<br/>
I think I was made for that<br/>
So I'm comin in when I feel like<br/>
To turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Stop all your blood claat cryin, I was flyin<br/>
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in<br/>
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear you mom<br/>
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31<br/>
They said the best classes go to the fastest<br/>
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get<br/>
Not even electives?  Not even prerequits?<br/>
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?<br/>
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin<br/>
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin<br/>
Man, this is a insult<br/>
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow<br/>
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo<br/>
Just notice at the end if I'm too late for the intro<br/>
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?<br/>
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all (Depends), oh, oh<br/>
... Stop you're cryin baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
You know when you be late you miss all the lights<br/>
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)<br/>
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight<br/>
That night (that night) that night<br/>
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow<br/>
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close<br/>
With the freshest hoes, the professors know<br/>
We about to get real unprofessional<br/>
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?<br/>
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like<br/>
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that<br/>
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that<br/>
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later<br/>
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it<br/>
I'm so live with it, look how I did it<br/>
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it<br/>
I know it's late and I took all year but<br/>
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah<br/>
<br/>
