It's amazing, I'm the reason<br/>
Everybody fired up this evening<br/>
I'm exhausted, barely breathing<br/>
Holding on to what I believe in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
No matter what, you'll never take that from me<br/>
My reign is as far as your eyes can see<br/>
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing <i>[x2]</i><br/>
It's amazing<br/>
<br/>
I'm a monster, I'm a killer<br/>
I know I'm wrong<br/>
I'm a problem<br/>
That'll never ever be solved<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me<br/>
My reign is as far as your eyes can see<br/>
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing <i>[x2]</i><br/>
It's amazing<br/>
<br/>
I'm a monster, I'm a maven<br/>
I know this world is changing<br/>
Never gave in, never gave up<br/>
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
No matter what, you'll never take that from me<br/>
My reign is as far as your eyes can see<br/>
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing <i>[x4]</i><br/>
It's amazing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
I'm amazing (amazing), yeah I'm all that (all that)<br/>
If I ain't on my grind than what you call that (what you call that)<br/>
Victorious, yeah we warriors<br/>
We make history, strive for victory (yeah)<br/>
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium<br/>
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah)<br/>
I'm amazing born on a full moon<br/>
I was breed to get it in, no spoon<br/>
That's why I'm so goon summer time no joke<br/>
Big family small house, no room<br/>
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard<br/>
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing<br/>
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing <i>[x4]</i><br/>
It's amazing
