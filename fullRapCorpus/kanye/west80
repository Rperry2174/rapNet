<i>[Sample From "Woods": Justin Vernon]</i><br/>
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind<br/>
I'm building a still to slow down the time<br/>
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind<br/>
I'm building a still to slow down the time<br/>
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind<br/>
I'm building a still to slow down the time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind<br/>
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night<br/>
Down for the night<br/>
Said she's down for the night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
You're my devil, you're my angel<br/>
You're my heaven, you're my hell<br/>
You're my now, you're my forever<br/>
You're my freedom, you're my jail<br/>
You're my lies, you're my truth<br/>
You're my war, you're my truce<br/>
You're my questions, you're my proof<br/>
You're my stress and you're my masseuse<br/>
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa<br/>
Lost in this plastic life,<br/>
Let's break out of this fake ass party<br/>
Turn this into a classic night<br/>
If we die in each other's arms still get laid in the afterlife<br/>
If we die in each other's arms still get laid<br/>
<br/>
(I'm lost in the world)<br/>
Run from the lights, run from the night,<br/>
(I'm down on my mind)<br/>
Run for your life,<br/>
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night<br/>
Down for the night<br/>
Down for the night<br/>
I'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life,<br/>
I'm new in the city but I'm down for the night<br/>
Down for the night<br/>
Down for the night<br/>
<br/>
Who will survive in America?<br/>
Who will survive in America?<br/>
Who will survive in America?<br/>
Who will survive in America?<br/>
<br/>
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind<br/>
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night<br/>
Down for the night<br/>
Said she's down for the night<br/>
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind<br/>
I'm new in the city and I'm goin' for a ride<br/>
Goin' for a ride<br/>
I'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life<br/>
I'm new in the city but I'm down the for the night<br/>
Down for a night, down for a good time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gil-Scott Heron:]</i><br/>
Us living as we do upside down.<br/>
And the new word to have is revolution.<br/>
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.<br/>
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.<br/>
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.<br/>
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.<br/>
The signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.<br/>
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal.<br/>
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.<br/>
America was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.<br/>
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling in the mother country's crotch<br/>
<br/>
What does Webster say about soul?<br/>
All I want is a good home and a wife<br/>
And our children and some food to feed them every night.<br/>
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.<br/>
<br/>
Who will survive in America?<br/>
Who will survive in America?<br/>
Who will survive in America?<br/>
Who will survive in America?
