<i>[Verse 1: Pusha T]</i><br/>
Fraud niggas, y’all niggas, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
Your shit, make believe, rapping ‘bout my own life<br/>
That’s rare nigga, Ric Flair nigga<br/>
The power’s in my hair nigga, I get it, beat the chair nigga<br/>
SoHo, or Tribeca, three hoes, trifecta<br/>
Dope money, coke money, Hublot, my watch better<br/>
My pen’s better, you don’t write, trendsetter, you clone-like<br/>
Pay homage or K’s vomit, ungrateful niggas, I don’t like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chief Keef]</i><br/>
A fuck nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
A snitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
A bitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
Sneak disser, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
They smile in my face is what I don’t like<br/>
They steal your whole sound that’s a soundbite<br/>
The media crucify me like they did Christ<br/>
They want to find me not breathin’ like they found Mike<br/>
A girl’ll run her mouth only out of spite<br/>
But I never hit a woman never in my life<br/>
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phifer<br/>
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice<br/>
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice<br/>
Eatin’ good, vegetarian with the brown rice<br/>
Girls kissin’ girls, cause it’s hot right?<br/>
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes<br/>
They ain’t about that life, they ain’t about that life<br/>
We hangin’ out that window it’s about to be a Suge night<br/>
Free Bump J, real nigga for life<br/>
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice<br/>
Shout out to L-E-P, J Boogie right?<br/>
Chief Keef, King Louis, this is Chi, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chief Keef]</i><br/>
A fuck nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
A snitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
A bitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
Sneak disser, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
Don’t like, like, don’t like, like<br/>
A snitch nigga, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Chief Keef]</i><br/>
Fake Gucci, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
Smokin’ on this dope, higher than a kite<br/>
This bitch gon’ love me now, she gon’ let me pipe<br/>
Screaming Sosa, that’s that nigga that I like<br/>
I don’t want relations, I just want one night<br/>
Cause a thirsty bitch, that’s the shit that I don’t like<br/>
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life<br/>
And I spend on a bunch of clothes, cause I’m livin’ life<br/>
I come up on the scene, and I’m stealin’ light<br/>
bitch I’m high off life, got me feelin’ right<br/>
bitch I’m Chief Keef, fuck who don’t like<br/>
And bitch we GBE, we just gon’ cite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Big Sean]</i><br/>
We are not one and the same, nigga I’m fuckin’ insane, fuck is you sayin’?<br/>
Yo ass been doin’ the same, shit, not doin’ what you sayin’<br/>
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fuckin’ a lame, turn one ho to a train<br/>
Blow, blang, my niggas holdin’ that pain, I just hope you been praying<br/>
Bang bang, ridin’ for my niggas and that’s for life<br/>
High class I’m just surrounded by these low-lifes<br/>
And I run this bitch like it’s no lights<br/>
Goin’ hard the whole night cause I ain’t goin’ back to my old life, I promise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Jadakiss]</i><br/>
I done sold purple, I done sold white<br/>
Running outta work, that’s that shit I don’t like<br/>
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice<br/>
She blowin’ up my phone, that’s that bitch I don’t like<br/>
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut<br/>
Put the pressure on ‘em just when they think that I eased up<br/>
Thirty for the Cuban, ‘nother 30 for the Jesus<br/>
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
