Flashing lights, lights<br/>
Flashing lights, lights<br/>
Flashing lights, lights<br/>
Flashing lights, lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
She don't believe in shootin' stars,<br/>
but she believe in shoes &amp; cars<br/>
Wood floors in the new apartment,<br/>
couture from the store's department<br/>
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit,<br/>
I'm more of the, trips to Florida<br/>
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water<br/>
Straight from the page of your favorite author<br/>
And the weather so breezy,<br/>
man why can't life always be this easy<br/>
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,<br/>
I get a call like where are you Yeezy<br/>
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'<br/>
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi<br/>
Damn, these nigga's got me,<br/>
I hate these nigga's more than the Nazis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dwele]</i><br/>
As I recall, I know you love to show off<br/>
But I never thought that you would take it this far<br/>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br/>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I know it's been a while,<br/>
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing<br/>
I know I was foul bay-bay,<br/>
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,<br/>
And if somebody would've told me a month ago<br/>
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know<br/>
If somebody would've told me a year ago<br/>
it'd go, get this difficult<br/>
Feeling like Katrina with no fema<br/>
Like Martin with no Gina<br/>
Like a flight with no visa<br/>
First class with the seat back I still see ya<br/>
In my past, you on the other side of the glass<br/>
Of my memory's museum,<br/>
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,<br/>
come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dwele]</i><br/>
As I recall, I know you love to show off<br/>
But I never thought that you would take it this far<br/>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br/>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br/>
<br/>
As you recall, you know I love to show off<br/>
But you never thought that I would take it this far<br/>
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights<br/>
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights<br/>
<br/>
Flashing lights, lights<br/>
Flashing lights, lights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fade out]</i><br/>
Lights, lights, lights, lights...
