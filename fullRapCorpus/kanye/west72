Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
I'm living in the 21st century doin' something mean to it<br/>
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it<br/>
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it<br/>
I guess every superhero need his theme music<br/>
<br/>
No one man should have all that power<br/>
The clock's tickin' I just count the hours<br/>
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power<br/>
21st century schizoid man<br/>
<br/>
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open<br/>
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rollin',<br/>
Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'<br/>
With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands<br/>
In this white man world we the ones chosen<br/>
So goodnight cruel world I'll see you in the mornin',<br/>
Huh? I'll see you in the mornin'<br/>
This is way too much, I need a moment.<br/>
<br/>
No one man should have all that power<br/>
The clock's tickin'. I just count the hours<br/>
Stop trippin'. I'm tripping off the power<br/>
'Til then, fuck that the world's ours<br/>
And they say, and they say<br/>
And they say, and they say<br/>
And they say, and they say<br/>
21st century schizoid man<br/>
<br/>
Fuck SNL and the whole cast<br/>
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass<br/>
More specifically they can kiss my ass hole<br/>
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes!<br/>
You short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon<br/>
My furs is Mongolian,<br/>
My ice brought the goalies in<br/>
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic<br/>
He knows, he's so fuckin' gifted<br/>
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts<br/>
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault<br/>
My child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts<br/>
Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody<br/>
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me me<br/>
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking...<br/>
<br/>
No one man should have all that power<br/>
The clock's tickin' I just count the hours<br/>
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the powder<br/>
'Til then, fuck that the world's ours<br/>
And they say, and they say<br/>
And they say, and they say<br/>
And they say, and they say<br/>
21st century schizoid man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Colin Powells, Austin Powers<br/>
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation<br/>
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation<br/>
Well that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation<br/>
At the end of the day goddamn it I'm killin' this shit<br/>
I know damn well ya'll feelin' this shit<br/>
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick<br/>
I ain't got a power trip who you going home with?<br/>
How 'Ye doin'? I'm surviving<br/>
I was drinkin' earlier now I'm driving<br/>
Where the bad bitches huh? Where ya hidin'?<br/>
I got the power make your life so excitin'...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey<br/>
Hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3x]</i><br/>
Now this'll be a beautiful death<br/>
<i>[Dwele:]</i><br/>
I'm jumping out the window<br/>
I'm letting everything go<br/>
I'm letting everything go<br/>
<br/>
You got the power to let power flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ad-lib]</i><br/>
21st century schizoid man
