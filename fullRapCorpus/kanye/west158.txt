<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Party people in the place to be<br/>
You are now in the midst of a real MC<br/>
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me<br/>
Oooooooooooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Such an easy mornin', we on a ride<br/>
And I'm feelin' smooth as the way the Benz drive<br/>
Turn the radio down if they playin' that bullshit<br/>
They don't want black people to think at trial<br/>
He think he live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Common:]</i><br/>
He think he live, he think he cold<br/>
He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode<br/>
Eyes low'd, I let the skies hold the thoughts<br/>
The streets are like the high road that I go across<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets<br/>
The Phillip Lim remind them that it's Fashion Week<br/>
And the weather wasn't barely hot<br/>
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?<br/>
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, forever we hot<br/>
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
(This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop)<br/>
(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop!)<br/>
(This goes out to the allcore hip-hop)<br/>
(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
As 'Ye flips the piano<br/>
The mood swings like the change of a channel<br/>
He's heating up like they wrapped him in flannel<br/>
Sellin' kilos through your iPod nano<br/>
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal<br/>
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury's handle<br/>
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires<br/>
Ice cream paint job, somethin' like Breyers<br/>
Euro tank top, Dior inspired<br/>
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required<br/>
(Eyuck!) I'm 2012 in 2010<br/>
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz<br/>
Floss for the members of the gang with 28<br/>
While haters wish death 'pon me, that's many men<br/>
Yeah, and if you slaim you on your paper route<br/>
Stop talkin', motherfucker, pull your paper out<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right<br/>
Don't worry, we gon' be here all night<br/>
And you know a nigga rep that Westside (Westside!)<br/>
Westside, Westside!<br/>
So te-te-tell who the freshest of 'em all?<br/>
They claimin' that they fresh, they ain't fresher than my balls<br/>
A nigga seen the fresh like I'm headed to the fall<br/>
MC hunting season, putting heads up on the wall<br/>
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft<br/>
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers<br/>
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from As to Bs to Cs<br/>
All over double Ds, I be absent all week<br/>
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for<br/>
Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door<br/>
Hold on: That's the girl you gave a wedding ring?<br/>
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
And let me hear you say ahhhh<br/>
Va-va-va-va-va-va<br/>
Va-va-va-va-va-va<br/>
<br/>
Let me hear you say ahhhh<br/>
Va-va-va-va-va-va<br/>
Va-va-va-va-va-va<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Ay, we promised<br/>
<br/>
Now put your hands up to the sky<br/>
Until the day in that we die<br/>
And we'll be here all evenin'<br/>
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
Ready to go?<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready<br/>
<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready for me<br/>
I know the city gettin' ready
