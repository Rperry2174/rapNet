Good morning <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh<br/>
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed<br/>
I mean, damn, did you even see the test<br/>
You got D's mother fucker, D's, Rosie Perez<br/>
And yes, barely pass any and every class<br/>
Looking at every ass<br/>
Cheated on every test<br/>
I guess this is my dissertation<br/>
Homie, this shit is basic<br/>
Welcome to graduation<br/>
<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning<br/>
<br/>
Good morning<br/>
On this day we become legendary<br/>
Everything we dreamed of<br/>
I'm like a fly Malcolm X<br/>
Buy any jeans necessary<br/>
Detroit Red cleaned up<br/>
From the streets of the league<br/>
From an eighth to a key<br/>
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets<br/>
From the moments of pain<br/>
Look how far we done came<br/>
Haters saying ya changed<br/>
Now ya doing ya thing<br/>
<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning<br/>
<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future<br/>
While I hop in the Delorean<br/>
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student<br/>
Some people graduate, but we still stupid<br/>
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around<br/>
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus<br/>
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness<br/>
After all of that, you receive this<br/>
<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Hustlers, that's if you're still living<br/>
Get on down<br/>
Every time that we hear them<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Hustlers, that's if you're still living<br/>
Get on down<br/>
Every time that we hear them<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Hustlers, that's if you're still living<br/>
Get on down<br/>
Every time that we hear them<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Hustlers, that's if you're still living<br/>
Get on down<br/>
<br/>
Get on down<br/>
Get, get on down<br/>
Get on down<br/>
Get, get on down
