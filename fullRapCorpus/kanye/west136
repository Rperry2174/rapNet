Baby lion goes<br/>
Where the islands go<br/>
<br/>
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone<br/>
Million dollar renovations to a happy home<br/>
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life<br/>
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right<br/>
I wake up, assessin' the damages<br/>
Checkin' MediaTakeOut<br/>
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch<br/>
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out<br/>
I wake up, all veggies no eggs<br/>
I hit the gym, all chest no legs<br/>
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie<br/>
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie<br/>
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago<br/>
Ándale Ándale E.I, E.I, uh, oh<br/>
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone<br/>
You was the best of all time at the time though<br/>
Yeah, you wasn't mine though<br/>
<br/>
But I still drove 30 hours<br/>
But still drove 30 hours to you<br/>
<br/>
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam<br/>
Young producer just trying to get his flows off<br/>
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret<br/>
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off<br/>
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition<br/>
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December<br/>
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women<br/>
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl<br/>
You don't love me, you just pretendin'<br/>
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'<br/>
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago<br/>
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know<br/>
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you<br/>
You call down for an omelet<br/>
Girl it's 5 in the morning<br/>
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria<br/>
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me<br/>
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob<br/>
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs<br/>
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time<br/>
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job<br/>
<br/>
And I drove back 30 hours<br/>
<br/>
Were remains that long to lose sad<br/>
Better unsaid<br/>
Always turn, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[with André 3000:]</i><br/>
3 stacks, can you help me out?<br/>
30 hours<br/>
Yeah, this the type of shit you ride out to<br/>
30 hours<br/>

Now a nigga mad<br/>
Now I'm 'bout to drive 90 miles like Matt Barnes to kill...<br/>
30 hours<br/>
Just to kill..<br/>
Just to...<br/>
Just to...<br/>
I'm about to drive 90<br/>
90 miles like Matt Barnes just to whoop a nigga ass<br/>
It was my idea and now a nigga<br/>
30 hours<br/>
Now a nigga mad, now a nigga, uh<br/>
A stunna<br/>
Whoop him after school just to show I got class<br/>
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh<br/>
Duh-duh with you, yeah<br/>

You know what I'm sayin'? Drop some shit like that<br/>
Ay, woop him after school just to<br/>

Just ride out to that<br/>
Check it out, this the bonus track, this the bonus<br/>
My favorite albums just have like bonus joints like this<br/>
That's why they kick it off like this<br/>
Just did that Madison Square Garden<br/>
30 hours<br/>
Had to put the flyest nigga on this shit<br/>
The pyramids shall rise<br/>
30 hours<br/>
Look at all these Ultralight Beams flowin'<br/>
For all the moms, dads, the kids, the families that shared this moment with us<br/>
Let's rock out for 'bout<br/>
30 hours<br/>
You know, ay you know<br/>
Ay, you know, ay, you know<br/>
30 hours<br/>
Whole design team, Yeezy team, music team<br/>
Remember when the whole block'd get shout out?<br/>
This my version of a shout out track<br/>
30 hours<br/>
Let that mothafucka rock, let that, let that, yeah<br/>
To my brother Yasiin, holding it out in Africa<br/>
30 hours<br/>
To my family, thank you for holding me down<br/>
The media be after us<br/>
That's Gabe calling<br/>
Yo Gabe<br/>
