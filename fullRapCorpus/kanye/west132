<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Real friends, how many of us?<br/>
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends<br/>
It's not many of us, we smile at each other<br/>
But how many honest? Trust issues<br/>
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered<br/>
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle<br/>
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing<br/>
Hope you're doin' your thing too<br/>
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions<br/>
Fuck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion<br/>
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined<br/>
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?<br/>
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom<br/>
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you're not the problem<br/>
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday<br/>
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?<br/>
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?<br/>
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime<br/>
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime<br/>
Even when we was young I used to make time<br/>
Now we be way too busy just to make time<br/>
Even for my...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Real friends<br/>
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?<br/>
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him<br/>
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?<br/>
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was<br/>
Couldn't tell you how old your son is<br/>
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg<br/>
Plus I already got one kid<br/>
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though<br/>
I just showed up for the yams though<br/>
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister<br/>
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business<br/>
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?<br/>
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with<br/>
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit<br/>
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children<br/>
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me<br/>
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me<br/>
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries<br/>
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy<br/>
Money turn your kin into an enemy<br/>
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be<br/>
<br/>
Lookin' for all my real friends<br/>
How many of us? How many of us are real friends<br/>
To real friends, to the real end<br/>
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin<br/>
To 3 A.M., callin'<br/>
How many real friends?<br/>
Just to ask you a question<br/>
Just to see how you was feelin'<br/>
How many?<br/>
For the last you was frontin'<br/>
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, oh you good?"<br/>
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'<br/>
How many?<br/>
What's best for your family, immediate or extended<br/>
Any argument, the media'll extend it<br/>
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on<br/>
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him<br/>
Real friends<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Real friends<br/>
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I<br/>
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him<br/>
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I<br/>
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
