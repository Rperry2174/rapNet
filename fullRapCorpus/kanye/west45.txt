Find your dreams come true<br/>
And I wonder if you know<br/>
What it means, what it means<br/>
And I wonder if you know<br/>
What it means, what it means<br/>
And I wonder if you know<br/>
What it means to find your dreams<br/>
<br/>
I've been waiting on this my whole life<br/>
These dreams be waking me up at night<br/>
You say I think I'm never wrong<br/>
You know what, maybe you're right, aight<br/>
<br/>
And I wonder if you know<br/>
What it means, what it means<br/>
And I wonder if you know<br/>
What it means to find your dreams<br/>
<br/>
You say he get on your fucking nerves<br/>
You hope that he get what he deserves, word<br/>
Do you even remember what the issue is<br/>
You just trying to find where the tissue is<br/>
You can still be who you wish you is<br/>
It ain't happen yet<br/>
And that's what the intuition is<br/>
When you hop back in the car<br/>
Drive back to the crib<br/>
Run back to their arms<br/>
The smokescreens<br/>
The chokes and the screams<br/>
You ever wonder what it all really mean<br/>
<br/>
And I wonder if you know<br/>
What it means, what it means<br/>
And I wonder if you know<br/>
What it means to find your dreams<br/>
<br/>
And I'm back on my grind<br/>
A psychic read my lifeline<br/>
Told me in my lifetime<br/>
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline<br/>
And that's what I'm<br/>
Seven o'clock, that's primetime<br/>
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hot lines<br/>
Why he keep giving me hot lines<br/>
I'm a star, how could I not shine<br/>
How many ladies in the house<br/>
How many ladies in the house without a spouse<br/>
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused<br/>
What you about<br/>
On that independent shit<br/>
Trade it all for a husband and some kids<br/>
You ever wonder what it all really mean<br/>
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams
