Wise men say<br/>
Wise men say<br/>
Wise men say<br/>
The baddest niggas out there bro<br/>
Never figure out real love<br/>
You'll never figure out real love<br/>
You'll never figure out real love<br/>
<br/>
Its so crazy<br/>
I got everything figured out<br/>
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about<br/>
No doubt<br/>
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what real love is about<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I sacrificed real life<br/>
For all the fame of flashing lights?<br/>
Do you think I sacrifice a real life<br/>
For all the fame of flashing lights?<br/>
<br/>
There is no Gucci I can buy<br/>
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on<br/>
There is no YSL that they could sell<br/>
To get my heart out of this hell<br/>
And my mind out of this jail<br/>
There is no clothes that I could buy<br/>
That could turn back the time<br/>
There is no vacation spot I could fly<br/>
That could bring back a piece of real life<br/>
Real life, what does it feel like?<br/>
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight<br/>
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight<br/>
To live a real life<br/>
I just want to be a real boy<br/>
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy<br/>
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy<br/>
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy<br/>
<br/>
Its funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it<br/>
I tell the truth and I keep running<br/>
Its like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something<br/>
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing<br/>
<br/>
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?<br/>
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel<br/>
Do you really have the stamina...<br/>
For everybody that sees you and that say 'where's my camera?'<br/>
For everybody that sees you and says 'sign my autograph'<br/>
For everybody that sees you and says that 'you all that'<br/>
You all that<br/>
I just want to be a real boy,<br/>
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy<br/>
Pinocchio story goes...<br/>
<br/>
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me<br/>
The only one was behind me I cant find her no more,<br/>
I cant find her no more I cant...<br/>
the only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...<br/>
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream<br/>
<br/>
And the fame will be got caught<br/>
And the day I moved to LA<br/>
Maybe that was all my fault<br/>
All my fault to be a real boy<br/>
Chasing the American dream,<br/>
Chasing everything we seen<br/>
Up on the TV screen<br/>
And when I- the Benz was left<br/>
And the clothes was left<br/>
And the hoes was left<br/>
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-<br/>
You spent the doughs to death<br/>
And tell me what-tf for a real boy<br/>
<br/>
They say Kanye you keep it too real boy<br/>
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way<br/>
The wise man say, you'll find your way<br/>
The wise man say, you'll find your way<br/>
The wise man say
