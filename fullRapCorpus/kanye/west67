<i>[Intro: Kanye West (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
I'm cold! (Yeah)<br/>
I'm cold! (Yeah)<br/>
I'm cold! (Yeah)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I got the right<br/>
To put up a fight<br/>
But not quite<br/>
Cause you cut off my light<br/>
But my sight<br/>
Is better tonight<br/>
And I might see you in my nightmare<br/>
Oh how'd you'd get there<br/>
Cause we were once a fairy tale<br/>
But this is farewell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I got my life<br/>
And it's my only one<br/>
I got the night<br/>
I'm running from the sun<br/>
So good night<br/>
I made it out the door, door, door, door,door<br/>
After tonight<br/>
There will be no return<br/>
After tonight<br/>
I'm taking off on the road<br/>
I'm taking off on the road<br/>
And letting you know<br/>
LETTING YOU KNOW<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Tell everybody that you know<br/>
That I don't love you no more<br/>
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Okay I'm back up on my grind<br/>
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine<br/>
You do you cause I'm just gon' be fine<br/>
Okay I got you out my mind<br/>
And the night is young<br/>
The drinks is cold<br/>
The stars is out<br/>
I'm ready to go<br/>
You always thought I was always wrong<br/>
Well now you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Kanye West]</i><br/>
Tell everybody, EVERYBODY that you know<br/>
Tell everybody that you know<br/>
That I don't love you no more<br/>
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I got the right<br/>
To put up a fight<br/>
But not quite<br/>
Cause you cut off my light<br/>
But my sight<br/>
Is better tonight<br/>
And I might see you in my nightmare<br/>
Oh how'd you'd get there<br/>
Cause we were once a fairy tale<br/>
But this is farewell<br/>
<br/>
Babygirl I'm finished<br/>
I thought we were committed<br/>
I thought we were cemented<br/>
I really thought we meant it<br/>
But now we just repent it<br/>
And now we just resent it<br/>
The clouds is in my vision<br/>
Look how high that I be getting<br/>
And it's all because of you<br/>
Girl we through<br/>
You think your shit don't stank<br/>
but you are Mrs. P-U<br/>
And I don't see you<br/>
With me no more<br/>
Now tell everybody THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye West]</i><br/>
THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
Tell everybody that you know<br/>
That I don't love you no more<br/>
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
<br/>
L-L-L-L-LETTING YOU KNOW<br/>
Tell everybody that you know<br/>
That I don't love you no more<br/>
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW<br/>
THAT YOU KNOW
