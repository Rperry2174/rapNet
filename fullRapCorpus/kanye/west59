<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
My friend showed me pictures of his kids<br/>
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs<br/>
He said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)<br/>
And all I got was a brand new sports car<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And my head keeps spinning<br/>
Can't stop having these visions<br/>
I gotta get wit' it<br/>
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho<br/>
And my head keeps spinning<br/>
I can't stop having these visions<br/>
I gotta get wit' it<br/>
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laugh<br/>
But I couldn't hear em all the way in first class<br/>
Chased the good life my whole life long<br/>
Look back on my life and my life gone<br/>
Where did I go wrong?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
I seen it, I seen it before<br/>
I seen it, I seen it before<br/>
I've seen it, I've seen it before<br/>
I seen it, I seen it before<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
My god sister gettin' married by the lake<br/>
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take<br/>
Bad enough that I showed up late<br/>
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake<br/>
Welcome to Heartbreak<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Oh ho<br/>
Oh ho<br/>
Oh ho<br/>
<br/>
And I can't, and I can't stop<br/>
No, no I can't stop<br/>
No, no, no, no I can't stop<br/>
No, no, no, no I can't stop<br/>
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop<br/>
No, no, no, no<br/>
No, no, no, no<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
No, no I can't stop<br/>
<br/>
Can't stop having these visions<br/>
I gotta get wit it<br/>
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho<br/>
Oh ho<br/>
Oh... oh ho
