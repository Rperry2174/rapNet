<i>[Pastor T.L. Barrett:]</i><br/>
You're the only power<br/>
You're the only power that can<br/>
You're the only power<br/>
You're the only power that can, ohhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe<br/>
Nothing unwanted<br/>
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe<br/>
Nothing unwanted<br/>

<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Just want to feel liberated, I, I, I<br/>
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I<br/>
If I ever instigated I’m sorry<br/>
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I<br/>
<br/>
Now if I fuck this model<br/>
And she just bleached her asshole<br/>
And I get bleach on my T-shirt<br/>
I'mma feel like an asshole<br/>
I was high when I met her<br/>
We was down in Tribeca<br/>
She get under your skin if you let her<br/>
She get under your skin if you-uh<br/>
I don't even want to talk about it<br/>
I don't even want to talk about it<br/>
I don't even want to say nothing<br/>
Everybody gon' say something<br/>
I'd be worried if they said nothing<br/>
Remind me where I know you from?<br/>
She looking like she owe you some<br/>
You know just what we want<br/>
I want to wake up with you in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi:]</i><br/>
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe<br/>
Nothing unwanted<br/>
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe<br/>
Nothing unwanted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Just want to feel liberated, I, I, I<br/>
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I<br/>
If I ever instigated I’m sorry<br/>
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I
