<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Let me get my theme music! <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain:]</i><br/>
Baby, just forget everything that you know<br/>
Let's take it all the way back to hello<br/>
They say you're living like you died before<br/>
I got a place that only I can go<br/>
Oooh let me take you to flight school<br/>
We'll learn to fly<br/>
Oooh let me take you to flight school<br/>
Above all the lights<br/>
Hey<br/>
You've never been so high kiss the ground goodbye<br/>
and you say damn baby how did you get that fly<br/>
Flight School<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I got my superman power, my superman cape<br/>
These the last hours but superman late<br/>
Clock is ticking, damn, can you wait<br/>
Man will he come back and save the day<br/>
Fly across the earth put things in reverse<br/>
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse<br/>
Certain things I can't doctor and you say I'm the worst<br/>
I ain't have enough patience but I needed a nurse<br/>
That'll come by my bed late, see if my head ache<br/>
Then get my head straight then give me head great<br/>
Every time I popped up like the VCR<br/>
I took your breath away then we performed CPR<br/>
With all the cars the clothes, the lights, the boats<br/>
I guess I was just trying to sow my raw oats<br/>
In the penthouse position with penthouse b*tches<br/>
See I pimped my crib so I must exhibit<br/>
Sh!t these last years been a haze like Isaac<br/>
So I close my eyes tighter than asian eyes<br/>
Get realize I got the same wings angels fly with<br/>
Louis Vuitton feathers now that's some fly sh*t<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain:]</i><br/>
Baby<br/>
Just forget everything that you know<br/>
Let's take it all the way back to hello<br/>
They say you're living like you died before<br/>
I got a place that only I can go<br/>
Oooh let me take you to flight school<br/>
We'll learn to fly<br/>
Oooh let me take you to flight school<br/>
Above all the lights<br/>
Hey<br/>
You've never been so high kiss the ground goodbye<br/>
And you say damn baby how did you get that fly<br/>
Flight School
