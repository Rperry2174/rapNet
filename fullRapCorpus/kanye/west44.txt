Work it, make it, do it,<br/>
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[played in background, continuously:]</i><br/>
Work it harder, make it better,<br/>
do it faster, makes us stronger,<br/>
more than ever, hour after,<br/>
Our work is never over.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Na-na-na that that don't kill me<br/>
Can only make me stronger<br/>
I need you to hurry up now<br/>
'Cause I can't wait much longer<br/>
I know I got to be right now<br/>
'Cause I can't get much wronger<br/>
Man I've been waitin' all night now<br/>
That's how long I've been on you<br/>
<br/>
I need you right now<br/>
I need you right now<br/>
<br/>
Let's get lost tonight<br/>
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight<br/>
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight<br/>
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right?<br/>
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior<br/>
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore<br/>
I ask 'cause I'm not sure<br/>
Do anybody make real shit anymore?<br/>
Bow in the presence of greatness<br/>
'cause right now thou hast forsaken us<br/>
You should be honored by my lateness<br/>
That I would even show up to this fake shit<br/>
So go ahead go nuts go ape shit<br/>
Especially in my pastel on my bape shit<br/>
Act like you can't tell who made this<br/>
New gospel homie, take six, and take this, haters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I need you right now<br/>
I need you right now<br/>
<br/>
Me likey<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if you got a man or not,<br/>
If you made plans or not<br/>
If God put me in your plans or not<br/>
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot<br/>
But I know that God put you in front of me<br/>
<br/>
So how the hell could you front on me?<br/>
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me<br/>
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment right?<br/>
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night<br/>
So we gon' do everything that Kan like<br/>
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike<br/>
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde-dike<br/>
And she'll do anything for the limelight<br/>
And we'll do anything when the time's right<br/>
Ugh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I need you right now<br/>
I need you right now<br/>
<br/>
You know how long I've been on you?<br/>
Since Prince was on Appolonia<br/>
Since OJ had Isotoners<br/>
Don't act like I never told you <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Baby, you're making it (harder, better, faster, stronger)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I need you right now <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
You know how long I've been on you?<br/>
Since Prince was on Appolonia<br/>
Since OJ had Isotoners<br/>
Don't act like I never told you<br/>
Never told you <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Never over <i>[x8]</i>
