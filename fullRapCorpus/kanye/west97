<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
We in the time of our lives baby<br/>
Turn the music up, primetime<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, primetime, beat by Dion, our third eon<br/>
That’s what the fuck we on<br/>
Mo’ money, 40 year old phenom<br/>
My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond<br/>
At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws<br/>
Still wearing my 23’s they can’t fuck with the boy<br/>
As far as them 16’s, I’m 23 of it all<br/>
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce<br/>
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof<br/>
Started in 88’, got warm in 92’, I landed in 96’<br/>
That’s the year I came through<br/>
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose<br/>
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff’s stock a boost<br/>
New money, I found the fountain of youth<br/>
I’m headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu<br/>
A case of Ace, make it 2, nigga we rolling, beat the deuce<br/>
The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do (ooh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh<br/>
The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do, huh<br/>
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh<br/>
<br/>
Primetime, basking in the lime<br/>
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line<br/>
Cause they don’t want nobody that’s colored out of the lines<br/>
So I’m late as a motherfucker, colored people time<br/>
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?<br/>
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime<br/>
Niggas gon’ kill me, I swear they better be lying<br/>
I never live in fear, I’m too out of my mind<br/>
Primetime, never hit these heights<br/>
I mean it’s like, it’s like our first 1st class flight<br/>
I’m trippin’ on it, socks on marble floors<br/>
I’m slippin’ on it, champagne, I’m sippin’ on it<br/>
Shit taste different, don’t it?<br/>
You know what, you right<br/>
It’s like the best damn champagne I had in my life<br/>
“When you coming home” That’s a text from my wife<br/>
I told her, run a bubble bath<br/>
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft<br/>
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back<br/>
I mean who says shit like that, and doesn’t laugh (un-huh)<br/>
<br/>
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh<br/>
The night is young, what the fuck we gon’ do, huh<br/>
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
