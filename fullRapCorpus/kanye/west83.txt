<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Human beings in a mob<br/>
What’s a mob to a king?<br/>
What’s a king to a god?<br/>
What’s a god to a non-believer?<br/>
Who don’t believe in anything?<br/>
<br/>
We make it out alive<br/>
All right, all right<br/>
No church in the wild<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Tears on the mausoleum floor<br/>
Blood stains the coliseum doors<br/>
Lies on the lips of a priest<br/>
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast<br/>
Rollin’ in the Rolls-Royce Corniche<br/>
Only the doctors got this, I’m hidin’ from police<br/>
Cocaine seats<br/>
All white like I got the whole thing bleached<br/>
Drug dealer chic<br/>
I’m wonderin’ if a thug’s prayers reach<br/>
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?<br/>
Socrates asks, “Whose bias do y’all seek?”<br/>
All for Plato, screech<br/>
I’m out here ballin’, I know y’all hear my sneaks<br/>
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats<br/>
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats<br/>
Preach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Human beings in a mob<br/>
What’s a mob to a king?<br/>
What’s a king to a god?<br/>
What’s a god to a non-believer?<br/>
Who don’t believe in anything?<br/>
<br/>
We make it out alive<br/>
All right, all right<br/>
No church in the wild<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The-Dream]</i><br/>
I live by you, desire<br/>
I stand by you, walk through the fire<br/>
Your love is my scripture<br/>
Let me into your encryption<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra<br/>
I call that jungle fever<br/>
You will not control the threesome<br/>
Just roll the weed up until I get me some<br/>
We formed a new religion<br/>
No sins as long as there’s permission’<br/>
And deception is the only felony<br/>
So never fuck nobody wit’out tellin’ me<br/>
Sunglasses and Advil<br/>
Last night was mad real<br/>
Sun comin’ up, 5 a.m.<br/>
I wonder if they got cabs still<br/>
Thinkin’ ’bout the girl in all-leopard<br/>
Who was rubbin’ the wood like Kiki Shepard<br/>
Two tattoos, one read “No Apologies”<br/>
The other said “Love is cursed by monogamy”<br/>
That’s somethin’ that the pastor don’t preach<br/>
That’s somethin’ that a teacher can’t teach<br/>
When we die, the money we can’t keep<br/>
But we probably spend it all ’cause the pain ain’t cheap<br/>
Preach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Human beings in a mob<br/>
What’s a mob to a king?<br/>
What’s a king to a god?<br/>
What’s a god to a non-believer?<br/>
Who don’t believe in anything?<br/>
<br/>
Will he make it out alive<br/>
All right, all right<br/>
No church in the wild<br/>
No church in the wild<br/>
No church in the wild<br/>
No church in the wild
