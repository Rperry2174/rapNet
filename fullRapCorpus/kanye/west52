"I got fury in my soul,<br/>
fury's gonna take me to the glory goal.<br/>
In my mind I can't study war no more."<br/>
<br/>
Gonna take you to the glory<br/>
Oh I can't study war<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
No no<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Uh<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Now where the south side<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Uh uh uh<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Now where the west side<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Yep<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
Can I talk my shit again?<br/>
Even if I don't hit again<br/>
Dog are you fucking kidding?<br/>
My hat, my shoes, my coat, Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatello Versace,<br/>
That's Louis Vuitton bitch<br/>
I think Hennessy, I drank I'm gone on that Bacardi Lemon, Corona, I'm zoning<br/>
Class back in session so I up't it a grade<br/>
Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwyane Wade<br/>
And A<br/>
Please don't start me<br/>
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley<br/>
I'm pop the barkers, I'm hood like parkers<br/>
While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up<br/>
I touched on everything<br/>
Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring<br/>
You all brides maids catch the garter<br/>
On nights when romance<br/>
Cameras flash so much<br/>
That I gotta do that yayo dance<br/>
I'm on a world tour with Common my man<br/>
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van<br/>
It's easy<br/>
The hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy and o yeah yeezy<br/>
I did it for the glory<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus sample]</i><br/>

I can't study war<br/>
No no<br/>

No no<br/>
The glory<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
No no<br/>

No no I can't study war<br/>
No no I can't study war<br/>
The glory<br/>
No no<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
What am I supposed to do now?<br/>
Man the game all messed up<br/>
How I suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up<br/>
So yeah at the Grammies I went ultra Travolta<br/>
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little gweedo<br/>
But with my ego, I can stand there with a speedo<br/>
And still be looked at like a fucking hero<br/>
The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic<br/>
Empty bottles of no do's<br/>
Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo<br/>
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's<br/>
The furrest man that shit that you don't floss<br/>
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss<br/>
Why I gotta ask what that to door cost<br/>
House on the hill<br/>
Two doors from Tracey Ross<br/>
And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinned ones<br/>
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em<br/>
When you meet me in person what does it feel like<br/>
I know, I know I look better in real life<br/>
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot<br/>
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot<br/>
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG<br/>
Anyone big pun big l or notorious<br/>
Fit in<br/>
Get money and stunt and stay glorious<br/>
And I'm gonna start killin' these niggas as soon as the chorus hit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus sample]</i><br/>
<br/>
No no I can't study war<br/>
Yeah I'm gonna start killin' these niggas soon as the chorus hit<br/>
I can't study war<br/>
