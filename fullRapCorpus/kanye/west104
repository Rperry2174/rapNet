<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Kanye West!<br/>
(Swag King Cole)<br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Can't a young nigga get money any more?<br/>
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor<br/>
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws<br/>
Come to meet me without no drawers?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik<br/>
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music<br/>
In the projects one day, to Project Runway<br/>
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it<br/>
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up<br/>
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it<br/>
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid<br/>
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!<br/>
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute<br/>
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!<br/>
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you<br/>
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick<br/>
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz<br/>
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim<br/>
Around the same time she had fell in love with him<br/>
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang<br/>
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team<br/>
La Familia, Roc Nation<br/>
We in the building, we still keep it basement<br/>
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute<br/>
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news<br/>
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you<br/>
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you<br/>
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh<br/>
Anything else, we detest, detest<br/>
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts<br/>
All that said, let me ask this quest'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you<br/>
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you<br/>
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you<br/>
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some Theraflu<br/>
<br/>
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the Theraflu<br/>
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the Theraflu<br/>
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)<br/>
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh uh) Get the Theraflu
