<i>[Young Thug &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
High lights<br/>
Tell my baby I'm back in town<br/>
High lights<br/>
Tell everybody I'm back in town<br/>
High lights<br/>
Tell my baby I'm back in town<br/>
High lights<br/>
We only makin' the highlights<br/>
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights<br/>
We only makin' the highlights<br/>
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights<br/>
Can we play that back one time?<br/>
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play shit back, I don't know<br/>
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro<br/>
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo<br/>
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro<br/>
We only makin' the highlights<br/>
We only makin' the highlights<br/>
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[El Debarge:]</i><br/>
One life, one night<br/>
High lights<br/>
Livin' the life 'til I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I bet me and Ray J would be friends<br/>
If we ain't love the same bitch<br/>
Yeah, he might have hit it first<br/>
Only problem is I'm rich<br/>
Uh<br/>
21 Grammys, superstar family<br/>
We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action<br/>
I'm about that Farrakhan<br/>
Life is a marathon<br/>
I'ma shift the paradigm<br/>
I'ma turn up every time<br/>
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit<br/>
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot<br/>
One time for a nigga really gettin' it<br/>
Two times cause we got the whole city lit<br/>
Advice to all my niggas, impregnate Bridget<br/>
Soon as she have a baby she gon' make another nigga<br/>
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches hah?<br/>
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?<br/>
She spent her whole check on some Christians<br/>
And that girl ain't even religious<br/>
Walkin', livin', breathin', girl you know my past well<br/>
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed<br/>
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob, help him with the weight<br/>
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate<br/>
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back<br/>
What you want?<br/>
You want a boss or an R&amp;B nigga with a six pack?<br/>
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox<br/>
I need to know right now if you a freak or not<br/>
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox<br/>
I need to know right now if you a freak or not<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The-Dream:]</i><br/>
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox<br/>
I want to know right now if you a freak or not<br/>
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox<br/>
I want to know right now if you a freak or not<br/>
Oh lord, oh lord<br/>
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox<br/>
I want to know right now if you a freak or not<br/>
Bad bitch up in Equinox<br/>
I want to know right now if you a freak or not<br/>
Oh lord, oh lord
