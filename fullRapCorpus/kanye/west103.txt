<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Stutterin’<br/>
Givin’em rest and makin’ love again<br/>
In my best I be the run again<br/>
And I have the man dem stutterin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I’m getting this nigga in the morning<br/>
He gon’ think he been chiefin just too long when<br/>
He see me in the evenin’<br/>
Want to catch all these feelin<br/>
Well let me be the first to get mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Raekwon]</i><br/>
Ay yo, ay yo, barbeque and blow in the back of the crib<br/>
Sittin’and countin’, smoking a spliff, this shit’s a gift<br/>
All my niggas watches is rough<br/>
Grabbing our crotches yelling ‘’What up?’’<br/>
The jeans cost $500? Fuck<br/>
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it’s a statement<br/>
One freeze of this shit, you won’t feel your legs kid<br/>
I’m a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious<br/>
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh<br/>
They yellin’ Chef, kill the plate with the cooks<br/>
I say ‘Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let’s Push<br/>
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers<br/>
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block<br/>
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap<br/>
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props<br/>
Rock a kilt, mean Glock I’m all machinery, ock<br/>
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock yo?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Common]</i><br/>
I was born by a late chicken shack and a church<br/>
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt<br/>
Golly, I know she wanna test the ‘Rari<br/>
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati<br/>
Life is foggy, tryin’ to see through the mist of it<br/>
Could have been livin’ it, you was Mrs. Mischievous<br/>
This is just a letter to better your development<br/>
Situation delicate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Pusha T]</i><br/>
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati<br/>
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair<br/>
Yeah<br/>
All Sonny no Cher, only solitaires<br/>
You clusterfucks could cluster up<br/>
On tippy-toe and still not muster up so its<br/>
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust<br/>
In God we trust, the game is all us<br/>
Til’ the sky calls or its flames on us<br/>
Push<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
2 Chainz<br/>
I’m chillin’ in my camo, flippin’ through the channel<br/>
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo’s a Lambo (damn)<br/>
Four doors of ammo<br/>
Ammunition I’m pitchin’ to make your body switch another position<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: CyHi da Prynce]</i><br/>
I hope the people is listening<br/>
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening<br/>
Its tickelin’ when I hear what haters be whisperin’<br/>
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?<br/>
Fake friends and siblings, like to wish you well but ain’t never flip the nickel in<br/>
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car<br/>
But you can’t spell war without an A-R<br/>
15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart<br/>
By 21 they said I’d be inside a graveyard<br/>
Can’t wait to get that black American Express<br/>
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: D’banj (Kanye West, Kid Cudi)]</i><br/>
Yeah, you feelin’ on top now, getting that money nigga?<br/>
(You sold your soul)<br/>
Yeah, you feelin’ on top now, getting that money nigga?<br/>
(You sold your soul)<br/>
Yeah, you feelin’ on top now, getting that money nigga?<br/>
(Naw man, mad people was frontin’<br/>
Aw man, made something from nothing)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I treat the label like money from my shows<br/>
G.O.O.D. would’ve been God except I added more o’s<br/>
If I knew she was cheatin’ I’d still’ve bought her more clothes<br/>
‘Cause I was too busy with my Baltimore- you know<br/>
Some people call that the art of war you know<br/>
I guess it depends what you fallin’ for<br/>
The clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes<br/>
Aw money, you sold your soul<br/>
Nah man, mad people was frontin’<br/>
God damn, we made something from nothing
