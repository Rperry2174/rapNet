<i>[Chorus: Pusha T]</i><br/>
Doing my thing, pocket full of green<br/>
Hand on my dick in my thousand dollar jeans<br/>
Your girl a Queen, my girl a thing<br/>
You know what though? I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I'm a take this one for the team<br/>
GOOD music<br/>
Yeah you know what<br/>
I figured out I'm not a nice guy<br/>
I shook hands, kissed babies gave it a nice try<br/>
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids<br/>
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs<br/>
I hate when other peoples crib's smell like shit<br/>
I hate when I leave, I smell like the crib<br/>
What's the cause of the poor smell?<br/>
She said "I just cleaned up baby I can't tell"<br/>
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell<br/>
Or that God-damn cucumber bath and body works<br/>
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works<br/>
What about Cool Water that shit probably worse<br/>
Is he a classic like the Ladi Dadi verse<br/>
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first<br/>
I score, he took the charge<br/>
Ooooh, that shit gotta hurt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Pusha T]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Nevermind me, 'Ye have fun<br/>
If the cops ask, that's my gun<br/>
That's my weed, anything you need<br/>
I'm a take, I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team<br/>
One fat ass, one flat ass<br/>
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass<br/>
Ever seen Joe's jeans on a jackass<br/>
And my bitch got on tights with a tac ass<br/>
I'm a fly nigga and I carry on<br/>
With the bottles of that Rose and Perignon<br/>
Ever seen how a kingpin carry's on<br/>
Dookie chain and a herringbone<br/>
Real shit, gotta feel this<br/>
First class flights baby that's a field trip<br/>
Double date don't cooperate, kill switch<br/>
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentleman<br/>
It's G.O.O.D music in the house<br/>
And we got Keri<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keri Hilson:]</i><br/>
All I know you the one that I heard about<br/>
Know you work your way up through word of mouth<br/>
Plus I'm a have to test you in and out<br/>
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta take it for the team<br/>
Take it for the team<br/>
Take it for the team<br/>
Take it for the team<br/>
<br/>
(I like your mentality baby)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cyhi The Prynce:]</i><br/>
I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar<br/>
I'm playing with her kitty later come in the car<br/>
She a red bone but her cousin is dark<br/>
A little out of shape but you'll fuck in the dark<br/>
Until she start complaining 'bout her feet hurt<br/>
I'm trying fuck, she talking she wanna eat first<br/>
I'm like why did this bitch have to bring her<br/>
I'm tryna get her back to the nest so I can sting her<br/>
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer<br/>
I said I gotta chick for you that'd like a singer<br/>
On a scale of 1-10 she's a 15â€²er<br/>
Meaner, shoulda seen a nigga face when he seen her<br/>
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger<br/>
Though on my team she will be a fifth stringer<br/>
I said I got the fine one and the beamer<br/>
I'm the point guard and I need wing...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keri Hilson:]</i><br/>
Take it for the team<br/>
Take it for the team<br/>
Take it for the team<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
