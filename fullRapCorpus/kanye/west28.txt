<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye]</i><br/>
How we stop the black panthers?<br/>
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer<br/>
You hear that?<br/>
What Jill Scott was hearin<br/>
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin.<br/>
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland<br/>
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynched<br/>
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since<br/>
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine<br/>
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it,sell it<br/>
The fiends cop it<br/>
Nowadays they cant tell if that's that good shit<br/>
We ain't sure man<br/>
Put the CD on your toungue yeah, thats pure man.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
From the place where the fathers gone,<br/>
The mothers is hardly home<br/>
And the...<br/>
Gonna lock us up in "Audy Home"<br/>
How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party homes<br/>
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam<br/>
Who gave Saddam anthrax?<br/>
George Bush got the answers<br/>
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical,<br/>
Am and Hammer baking soda<br/>
Raised they own quota<br/>
Writin when our soldiers ran for the stove cuz--<br/>
Cuz dreams of being 'Hova went from bein a brokeman ta bein a dopeman<br/>
Ta bein a president look theres hope man<br/>
This that inspiration for tha mos and tha folks man,<br/>
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosin.<br/>
And this is the soundtrack,<br/>
This tha type of music you make when you round that--<br/>
Crack music nigga,<br/>
That real black music nigga.<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Malik Yusef]</i><br/>
Our father, give us this day our daily bread ...give us these days and take our daily bread,<br/>
See I done did all this ole bullshit<br/>
And to attone I throw a little somethin, somethin on the pulpit.<br/>
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit<br/>
And what we gave back was crack music<br/>
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies<br/>
So our mammas aint got to be they cooks and nannies<br/>
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from granny<br/>
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys<br/>
This dark diction has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it.
