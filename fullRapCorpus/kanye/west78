I think I just fell in love with a porn star<br/>
Turn the camera on, she a born star<br/>
Turn the corners in a foreign car<br/>
Call the coroners do the CPR<br/>
She gave that old nigga a ulcer<br/>
Her bitter-sweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh<br/>
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh<br/>
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh<br/>
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh<br/>
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what!<br/>
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes, huh!<br/>
Well, I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Have you lost your mind?<br/>
Tell me when you think we crossed the line<br/>
No more drugs for me,<br/>
Pussy and religion is all I need<br/>
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life<br/>
<br/>
Never in your wildest dreams,<br/>
Never in your wildest dreams<br/>
In your wildest<br/>
You could hear the loudest screams,<br/>
Comin' from inside the screen<br/>
You a wild bitch<br/>
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy<br/>
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy<br/>
Or do anal, or do a gangbang<br/>
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing<br/>
Well, I guess a lot of niggas do gang bang<br/>
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang<br/>
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang<br/>
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang<br/>
<br/>
Have you lost your mind?<br/>
Tell me when you think we crossed the line<br/>
No more drugs for me,<br/>
Pussy and religion is all I need<br/>
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life<br/>
<br/>
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star<br/>
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard<br/>
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids<br/>
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid<br/>
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over<br/>
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja<br/>
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day<br/>
'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de<br/>
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame<br/>
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away."<br/>
How could you say they live they life wrong<br/>
When you never fuck with the lights on?<br/>
<br/>
Have you lost your mind?<br/>
Tell me when you think we crossed the line<br/>
No more drugs for me,<br/>
Pussy and religion is all I need<br/>
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life<br/>
<br/>
I think I fell in love with a porn star<br/>
And got married in a bathroom<br/>
Honeymoon on the dance floor<br/>
And got divorced by the end of the night<br/>
That's one hell of a life
