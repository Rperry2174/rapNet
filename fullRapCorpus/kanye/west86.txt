<i>[Otis Redding]</i><br/>
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah<br/>
You won't regret it, no no<br/>
No, girls they don't forget it<br/>
LOVE is their home, happiness, yeah<br/>
Squee... squee... squee... squeeze her<br/>
Don't tease her, never leave her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?<br/>
OWW! Uhh<br/>
<br/>
I invented swag<br/>
Poppin bottles, puttin supermodels in the cab<br/>
Proof...<br/>
I guess I got my swagger back, truth<br/>
New watch alert, Hublot's<br/>
Or the big face Roley, I got two of those<br/>
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow<br/>
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes; go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
"Damn Yeezy and Hov', where the hell you been?"<br/>
Niggaz talkin real reckless, stuntmen<br/>
I adopted these niggaz, Phillip Drummond 'em<br/>
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in<br/>
They say I'm crazy, well I'm 'bout to go dumb again<br/>
They ain't see me cause I pulled up in my other Benz<br/>
Last week I was in my other other Benz<br/>
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, photo shoot fresh, lookin like wealth<br/>
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself<br/>
Uh, live from the Mercer<br/>
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way I might murk ya<br/>
Flee in the G-450 I might surface<br/>
Political refugee asylum can be purchased<br/>
Uh, everything's for sale<br/>
I got five passports, I'm never goin to jail<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I made "Jesus Walks" I'm never goin to hell<br/>
Couture level flow, it's never goin on sale<br/>
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses<br/>
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive<br/>
I get it custom, you a customer<br/>
You ain't 'custommed to goin through customs, you ain't been nowhere, huh?<br/>
And all the ladies in the house got 'em showin off<br/>
I'm done, I'll hit you up maña-naaaaaaaaaa!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Welcome to Havana<br/>
Smokin Cubanas with Castro in cabanas<br/>
Viva México, Cubano<br/>
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know<br/>
Drivin Benzes, with no benefits<br/>
Not bad, huh? For some immigrants<br/>
Build your fences, we diggin tunnels<br/>
Can't you see we gettin money up under you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Can't you see the private jets flyin over you?<br/>
Maybach bumper sticker read "What would Hova do?"<br/>
Jay is chillin (uhh) 'Ye is chillin (uhh)<br/>
What more can I say? (What more can I say?) We killin 'em<br/>
Hold up, before we end this campaign<br/>
As you can see we done bodied the damn lanes<br/>
Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change<br/>
And pray that all of their pain be champagne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Otis Redding]</i><br/>
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Scream it! <i>[3X]</i>
