Ready!, Huh.<br/>
Yeah! um<br/>
Jesus, Jesus talk to me<br/>
Jesus, Jesus talk with me <br/>
Jesus, Jesus,<br/>
Jesus, Jesus,<br/>
Come on!<br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
God show me the way now the devil can’t break me down<br/>
(Jesus walk with me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye]</i><br/>
Between the girls and the jewelry<br/>
The devil trying to lure me<br/>
And view of me <br/>
(Jesus walks with me)<br/>
My pastor shaking his head<br/>
he ain’t sure of me<br/>
But surely <br/>
(Jesus walks with me)<br/>
Then he ask<br/>
do you say your prayers at least 2 a week?<br/>
I ain’t talking to God I know what I’ve been doing G.<br/>
Do you know how I be embarrassed?<br/>
my prayers sound like Ben Stiller on Meet the Parents<br/>
and I ain’t good with that “give us our day”, <br/>
this ladies just trying to give us our free<br/>
I’m trying to give us, us pay, <br/>
now you know how them strippers was,<br/>
We was all ghetto-fabulous all at the rooms at the Cyberus, <br/>
from this Jacuzzi wild can you cleanse us?<br/>
Can you please unfog my Cardierre lenses?<br/>
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses for me I almost died<br/>
falling asleep in them Benzes<br/>
Theirs something about this beat that get me tranquilized<br/>
and when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified <br/>
and HE gives me direction when I can’t decide<br/>
He is alive!, how can you tell me he ain’t when I said <br/>
<br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
God show me the way now the devil can’t break me down<br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
The only thing I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now<br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
And Now I think there’s something I can say now <br/>
that will right my wrongs <br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
I finally talked to God and I ain’t afraid cause his love is so strong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ma$e]</i><br/>
Before you take me name, take my fame,<br/>
While you at it take my shame, take my flaws, take my blame<br/>
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt, See my bruise, <br/>
and this you walk in my shoes<br/>
You weren’t there when I was in deep thought.<br/>
When I had two choice, kill him or either leave New York<br/>
But I’m a truth teller and that’s why I say what I’m sayin<br/>
And the only thing the radio playin is cause you be payin<br/>
It ain’t about who really hot no more<br/>
Beats would knock no more<br/>
so who cares who flock no more<br/>
I realize that most labels pay you for lies<br/>
And all that blood do is gain disguise<br/>
That you’re favorite artist shhhh<br/>
I know you hear that huh you wanna fear that what<br/>
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that<br/>
Con the rap this like John the Baptist<br/>
prepare the way for what I came to say today<br/>
They deceived us, had us thinking Jesus really didn’t need us<br/>
When he loved up all you<br/>
He loved them boys in hallway up in Broadway<br/>
even those who meet him for dope every 4 days<br/>
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway<br/>
To the Detroit player Gators in Moreys<br/>
With me its not just bars and music I walk with God<br/>
I have the scares to prove it,ugh<br/>
<br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
God show me the way now the devil can’t break me down<br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now<br/>
(Jesus Walks)<br/>
Everybody out there just lift your hands <br/>
right now and say this with me:<br/>
<br/>
“Father I thank you, for forgiving me, for everything I ever done,<br/>
for Jesus walking with me, for dying for me, raising for me, <br/>
and all my sins have been forgiven, I’m a changed man, <br/>
I’m healed I’m delivered,I’m rich and It’s all because of him”<br/>
Now Walk with me, Walk with me, Walk Walk Walk with me <br/>
Walk with me
