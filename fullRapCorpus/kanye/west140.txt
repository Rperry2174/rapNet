<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time<br/>
Back in the lab and shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody<br/>
And at this rate we gon' both die broke<br/>
Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt<br/>
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no<br/>
People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter<br/>
My friends best advice was to stay low<br/>
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills<br/>
Especially when you got family members on payroll<br/>
The media said it was outlandish spending<br/>
The media said he's way out of control<br/>
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending<br/>
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control<br/>
I know I'm the most influential<br/>
That TIME cover was just confirmation<br/>
This generation's closest thing to Einstein<br/>
So don't worry about me, I'm fine<br/>
I can see a thousand years from now in real life<br/>
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like<br/>
Grow conventional thought, don't need to question<br/>
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive<br/>
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission<br/>
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions<br/>
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission<br/>
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different<br/>
Never listen to Hollywood producers<br/>
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa<br/>
The ultimate Gemini has survived<br/>
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sampha:]</i><br/>
And you're looking at the church in the night sky<br/>
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi<br/>
Are we looking in the church in the night sky<br/>
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife<br/>
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky<br/>
Father, father, father<br/>
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi<br/>
The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come<br/>
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums<br/>
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro<br/>
If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho<br/>
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation<br/>
He sat back and smiled<br/>
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime<br/>
The Jews share they truth on how to make a dime<br/>
Most black men couldn't balance a cheque-book<br/>
But buy a new car, talking 'bout how my neck look?<br/>
Well it all looks great<br/>
Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains<br/>
The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard<br/>
Real family stick together and see through the mirage<br/>
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality<br/>
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?<br/>
I am one with the people<br/>
I am one with the people, real<br/>
I've awoken from an enlightened man's dream<br/>
Checking Instagram comments to crowd-source my self-esteem<br/>
Let me not say too much or do too much<br/>
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch<br/>
I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen<br/>
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping<br/>
God, I have humbled myself before the court<br/>
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort<br/>
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams<br/>
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me<br/>
When I turned on the news and they was burying me<br/>
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me<br/>
When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me<br/>
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see<br/>
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov<br/>
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove<br/>
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks<br/>
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'mma never go broke<br/>
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go<br/>
We all go<br/>
Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo<br/>
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo<br/>
Modern day MJ with an off-the-wall flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sampha:]</i><br/>
Nightlife, walk all over me<br/>
Walk all over me<br/>
I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring<br/>
Fly, fly, fly overseas<br/>
Fly overseas<br/>
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sampha:]</i><br/>
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky<br/>
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi<br/>
Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky<br/>
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife<br/>
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky<br/>
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi<br/>
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky<br/>
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sampha:]</i><br/>
Please face me when I speak<br/>
Please say to me something before you leave<br/>
You've been treating me like I'm invisible<br/>
Now I'm visible to you, oh, the invisible truths<br/>
Stay sober<br/>
I don't quite understand the games you play<br/>
Understand, understand<br/>
Understand I'm standing under oath<br/>
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore<br/>
While I'm crying at the bar<br/>
I'm wishing that you saw my scars, man<br/>
I'm wishing that you came down here<br/>
And stood by me<br/>
And look at me like you knew me<br/>
But I feel so alone<br/>
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sampha:]</i><br/>
And you're looking at the church in the night sky<br/>
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi<br/>
Are we looking at the church in the night sky?<br/>
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife<br/>
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky<br/>
Father, father, father<br/>
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi<br/>
Are we looking at the church in the night sky?<br/>
Father, father, father<br/>
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
