<i>[Hook - Curtis Mayfield:]</i><br/>
Add a little sugar, honeysuckle lamb<br/>
A great big expression of happiness<br/>
Boy, you couldn't miss with a dozen roses<br/>
Such would astound you<br/>
The joy of children laughing around you<br/>
These are all the makings of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I do it for the forefathers and the street authors<br/>
That are now A&amp;Rs in the cheap office<br/>
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers<br/>
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off of<br/>
Gave her a handshake only for my man’s sake<br/>
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake<br/>
Now there’s crumbs all over the damn place<br/>
And she want me to cum all over her damn face<br/>
I never understood planned parenthood<br/>
Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood<br/>
Taking refills of that Plan B pill<br/>
Another shorty that won’t make it to the family will<br/>
If I don’t make it, can’t take it, hope the family will<br/>
They ain't crazy, they don’t know how insanity feel<br/>
Don C just had a shorty, so it’s not that bad<br/>
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
No electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto<br/>
You know the demo, your boy act wild<br/>
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy’s back in style<br/>
Now one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget<br/>
What’s more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters<br/>
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they "sisters"<br/>
They momma named them after white bitches<br/>
So next time you see me on your fallopian<br/>
Though the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian<br/>
Stupid questions like “Is he gon' be dope again?<br/>
Have you seen him? has anybody spoke to him?”<br/>
This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch<br/>
And a bag of weed; the Holy Trinity<br/>
In the mirror where I see my only enemy<br/>
Your life’s cursed, well mine’s an obscenity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
This is my momma shit; I used to hear this<br/>
Through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pajama shit<br/>
Afros and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja had it<br/>
Popping like the sample that I’m rhyming with<br/>
Pete Rock, let the needle drop<br/>
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don’t needle pop<br/>
Taking sips of pop, six pack of Miller nips<br/>
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale<br/>
Bally’s on my feet help me balance out well<br/>
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale<br/>
I got it honest from the parties from my momma’s<br/>
Virgin Marys try to judge her<br/>
I’m like “Where the Madonnas now?”<br/>
Give all glory to Gloria<br/>
They said “you raised that boy too fast, but you was raising a warrior”<br/>
We victorious, they’ll never take the joy from us, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Kid Cudi (w/ Pete Rock):]</i><br/>
Keep your hands up, get mine up<br/>
Don’t let them take your fire<br/>
Yeah, okay<br/>
(It’s Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay)
