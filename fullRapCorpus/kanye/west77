<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Look at you <i>[14x]</i><br/>
Look at you <i>[8x]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, la-ladies and gentlemen<br/>
<br/>
And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong<br/>
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long<br/>
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most<br/>
So I think it's time for us to have a toast<br/>
<br/>
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,<br/>
Let's have a toast for the assholes,<br/>
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,<br/>
Every one of them that I know<br/>
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs<br/>
That'd never take work off<br/>
Baby, I got a plan<br/>
Run away fast as you can<br/>
<br/>
She find pictures in my e-mail<br/>
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick.<br/>
I don't know what it is with females<br/>
But I'm not too good at that shit.<br/>
See, I could have me a good girl<br/>
And still be addicted to them hood rats<br/>
And I just blame everything on you<br/>
At least you know that's what I'm good at<br/>
<br/>
And I always find<br/>
Yeah, I always find,<br/>
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong<br/>
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long<br/>
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most<br/>
So I think it's time for us to have a toast<br/>
<br/>
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,<br/>
Let's have a toast for the assholes,<br/>
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,<br/>
Every one of them that I know<br/>
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs<br/>
That'd never take work off<br/>
Baby, I got a plan<br/>
Run away fast as you can<br/>
<br/>
Run away from me, baby<br/>
Run away<br/>
Run away from me, baby<br/>
(Look at you, look at you, look at you)<br/>
Run away<br/>
When it starts to get crazy<br/>
(Look at you, look at you, look at you)<br/>
Just run away<br/>
Baby I got a plan<br/>
Run away as fast as you can<br/>
<br/>
Run away from me, baby<br/>
Run away<br/>
Run away from me, baby<br/>
(Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at you)<br/>
Run away<br/>
When it starts to get crazy<br/>
(Look at you, look at you, look at you)<br/>
Why can't she just, run away?<br/>
Baby I got a plan<br/>
Run away fast as you can<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind<br/>
I-I-I-I did it<br/>
All right, all right, I admit it<br/>
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it<br/>
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off<br/>
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knock-offs, ha, ha?<br/>
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off<br/>
Let's talk over Mai Tais, waitress, top it off<br/>
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers<br/>
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas<br/>
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet<br/>
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it<br/>
You should leave if you can't accept the basics<br/>
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix<br/>
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless<br/>
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless<br/>
P!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye:]</i><br/>
Never was much of a romantic,<br/>
I could never take the intimacy.<br/>
And I know I did damage,<br/>
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me,<br/>
I guess you knew in an advantage<br/>
'Cause you could blame me for everything.<br/>
And I don't know how I'mma manage,<br/>
If one day you just up and leave<br/>
And I always find yeah, I always find somethin' wrong<br/>
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long<br/>
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most<br/>
So I think it's time for us to have a toast<br/>
<br/>
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,<br/>
Let's have a toast for the assholes,<br/>
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,<br/>
Every one of them that I know<br/>
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs<br/>
That'd never take work off<br/>
Baby, I got a plan<br/>
Run away fast as you can
