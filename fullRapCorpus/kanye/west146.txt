<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy<br/>
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West - Verse 1]</i><br/>
They try to tell me my chain broke the levy,<br/>
Maybe cuz its flooded,<br/>
Why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin,<br/>
My teeth already white yall gone make me floss for nothing,<br/>
My teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin',<br/>
While yall got all caps on?,<br/>
Don Cheadle Time,<br/>
Get extra black on em',<br/>
Burn Hollywood burn,<br/>
Take too long for niggas to get their turn,<br/>
Probably be cremated before I get my urn,<br/>
They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids,<br/>
I swear life's a bitch on a period,<br/>
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx,<br/>
I make my jeweler add a few more links,<br/>
You can look at me and dont fuck what nobody thinks,<br/>
And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My chain heavy, yeah yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy<br/>
My chain heavy, yeah yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy<br/>
<br/>
Here we go, like we should<br/>
Feel the sweat, on ya face<br/>
Here we go, like we should<br/>
Feel the sweat, on ya face<br/>
Alright, okay<br/>
Here we go, like we should, like we should, like we should<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Question..<br/>
What color was the skin of the man who bared the cross?<br/>
No matter how many lashes they couldn't beat it off,<br/>
How many caskets will we see in one lifetime?<br/>
That's why its Miles Davis Kobe it's mic time,<br/>
I keep that gold book on a ottoman,<br/>
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800?s,<br/>
Yall forget that I got called nigger on Twitter so many times,<br/>
yo I lived that,<br/>
Now I'm just trying to find where to raise my kids at,<br/>
Cuz they don't want niggas next to where they crib at,<br/>
Hey real Tom lookin' for a nice park,<br/>
Twelve noon she say my family gone make it too dark,<br/>
This is the flow that solar eclipses,<br/>
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse the bullshit, they got us listenin' to,<br/>
In this existence,<br/>
Don't give up now just a little more persistence,<br/>
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson,<br/>
Keep 'em away huh, something might happen,<br/>
This is the making of a masterpiece,<br/>
so we broke out the chains and told the Master Peace.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talib Kweli]</i><br/>
Some wear a suit and tie, they dont wanna remain average<br/>
some wear a suit and tie like a chain in a straight jacket<br/>
my chain heavy stopping that traffic<br/>
coppers harrass us, the DA attack us want us in chains like BA Baracus<br/>
and a major factor in my decision to be a rapper was rebellion<br/>
being anti-establishment was attractive to a black kid from Brooklyn<br/>
flames got them things cooking, land of the jooks<br/>
where the lames got the chains tooken<br/>
it aint looking good for you if you a tourist<br/>
yeah sometimes our rhymes is on a frequency that only purists hear<br/>
a couple rappers try to beef with me, nobody scared<br/>
niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared<br/>
why I gotta battle rappers, I debate scholars<br/>
Question: Do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?<br/>
sick visions is living inside our brains<br/>
its like sadomasochistic addicted to whips and chains<br/>
figuratively quite, literally, clinically insane spit flames when I vist the higher planes<br/>
try in vain to ignore, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it<br/>
'Ye them load of a-whores by the boards trust<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence]</i><br/>
Uh, that old ball and chain had me chained up for weeks<br/>
of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets<br/>
and now when we leak she saying the games over<br/>
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker<br/>
now the new dude she saying that could stay over<br/>
should be a chain who goes by the name of choker<br/>
thats what he did when she told him he should play this over<br/>
so the chains on, throw em on the way over<br/>
but when I came over, his only response<br/>
well be the owner of a chain of restaurants<br/>
cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I worn<br/>
cause you be running round like the chain makes the man<br/>
so it obvious that he don't know the chain of command<br/>
cause my chain commands, that kind of respect<br/>
and its so chunky that its a pain in the neck<br/>
but it came with a check, I remember on chaining day<br/>
it spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say<br/>
"them chain snatchers are hoping that you aint ready<br/>
so don't get distracted keep your aim steady<br/>
or there'll be a chain reactionsince my chains heavy"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
