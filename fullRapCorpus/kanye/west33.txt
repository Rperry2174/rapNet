<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Diamonds are forever<br/>
They're all I need to please me<br/>
They can't stimulate or tease me<br/>
They won't leave in the night<br/>
Have no fear that they might<br/>
Desert me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
"Diamonds are forever forever forever"<br/>
Throw ya diamonds in the sky<br/>
If you feel the vibe<br/>
"Diamonds are forever forever forever"<br/>
The ROC is still alive<br/>
Everytime I rhyme<br/>
"Forever and ever! "<br/>
For ever ever? for ever ever? ever ever?<br/>
Ever ever? ever ever? ever ever? ever ever?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still<br/>
People lose hands, legs, arms for real<br/>
Little was known of Sierra Leone<br/>
And how it connect to the diamonds we own<br/>
When I speak of Diamonds in this song<br/>
I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glowin<br/>
I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain<br/>
These ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne<br/>
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',<br/>
How? when I know of the blood diamonds<br/>
Though it's thousands of miles away<br/>
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today<br/>
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs<br/>
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs<br/>
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses<br/>
I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless<br/>
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless<br/>
And here's the conflict<br/>
It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold<br/>
Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice<br/>
On a polo rugby it look so nice<br/>
How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?<br/>
'Fore I beat myself up like Ike<br/>
You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<i>[Kanye From Original Song:]</i><br/>
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh)<br/>
That'll be the same day I give the game back (uh)<br/>
You know the next question dog 'yo, where Dame at? ' (uh)<br/>
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!)<br/>
'Wassup with you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man? '<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yep!<br/>
I got it from here 'ye damn!<br/>
The chain remains, the game is in tact<br/>
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that<br/>
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? <i>[laughs]</i><br/>
Pardon me I had to laugh at that<br/>
How could you falter when you're the rock of Gibraltar<br/>
I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water<br/>
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin to me<br/>
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week<br/>
I do this in my sleep,<br/>
I sold Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's<br/>
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man<br/>
Let me handle my buisness, damn!<br/>
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy<br/>
YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me<br/>
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career<br/>
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire<br/>
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere<br/>
So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah<br/>
He don't even have to write rhymes<br/>
The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes<br/>
Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly<br/>
What I was sayin practically me whole career<br/>
The diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever<br/>
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better<br/>
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'<br/>
Instead we rose from the ashes like a phoenix<br/>
If you waitin' for the end of the dynasty sign<br/>
It'll seem like forever is a mighty long time<br/>
I'm young bitches <i>[laughs]</i><br/>
Goodnight!
