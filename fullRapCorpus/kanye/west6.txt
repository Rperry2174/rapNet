Yo, we at war<br/>
We at war with terrorism, racism, and most of all we at war with ourselves<br/>
(Jesus walks)<br/>
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down<br/>
(Jesus walks with me) with me, with me, with me <i>[fades]</i><br/>
<br/>
You know what the Midwest is?<br/>
Young &amp; Restless<br/>
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace<br/>
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus<br/>
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is<br/>
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death is<br/>
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh!<br/>
Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard<br/>
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method<br/>
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us<br/>
Saying, "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast."<br/>
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?<br/>
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases<br/>
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis<br/>
My mamma used to say only Jesus can save us<br/>
Well mamma I know I act a fool<br/>
But I'll be gone 'til November I got packs to move I Hope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
(Jesus walks)<br/>
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down<br/>
(Jesus walks with me)<br/>
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now<br/>
(Jesus walks)<br/>
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs<br/>
(Jesus walks with me)<br/>
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long<br/>
<br/>
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers<br/>
(Jesus walks with them)<br/>
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah<br/>
(Jesus walks with them)<br/>
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly<br/>
I know he hear me when my feet get weary<br/>
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct<br/>
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think<br/>
I ain't here to argue about his facial features<br/>
Or here to convert atheists into believers<br/>
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers<br/>
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus<br/>
So here go my single dog radio needs this<br/>
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus<br/>
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes<br/>
But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?<br/>
Well if this take away from my spins<br/>
Which will probably take away from my ends<br/>
Then I hope this take away from my sins<br/>
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about<br/>
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out<br/>
<br/>
(Jesus walks)<br/>
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down<br/>
(Jesus walks)<br/>
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now<br/>
(Jesus walks)<br/>
And I don't thing there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs<br/>
(Jesus walks with me... fades)<br/>
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
