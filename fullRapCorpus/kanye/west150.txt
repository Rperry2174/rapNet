<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do<br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Spread your wings, aerial<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lupe Fiasco]</i><br/>
Head to the sky, wings raised in<br/>
Shes about to fly and take her place in<br/>
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground<br/>
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around<br/>
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be<br/>
He told her, she'll be burned alive<br/>
She just told him trust me<br/>
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly<br/>
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me<br/>
And he knows that, because he knows her<br/>
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her<br/>
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays<br/>
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape<br/>
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end<br/>
One closed chapter, it opens up another part<br/>
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do<br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Spread your wings, aerial<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Don't let me hold you back<br/>
I only hold you back<br/>
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac<br/>
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes its so hard to say bye<br/>
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet<br/>
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet<br/>
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle<br/>
You woulda been the best mom<br/>
I would have been the best 'Ye<br/>
You see it all in my veins, like varicose<br/>
I know thats very gross but we getting very close<br/>
To our end, though I killed most with a pen<br/>
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do<br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Spread your wings, aerial<br/>
<br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do<br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Spread your wings, aerial<br/>
<br/>
How could you do it<br/>
How could you do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Okay now baby here we go, we go<br/>
No baby, me go<br/>
You got my heart<br/>
Baby this what it be for<br/>
I give it all as far as my feet go<br/>
What do you mean, me go<br/>
Why can't it be, we go<br/>
What happens when people turn to tears<br/>
Dreams turn to memories<br/>
And weeks turn to years<br/>
Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks<br/>
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts<br/>
Man, our vacation was coming next week<br/>
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)<br/>
How cud my girl do this to me<br/>
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me<br/>
Now I'm testing one two<br/>
Reportin live from the rubble<br/>
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you<br/>
One, two, three, four, five models on the double<br/>
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle<br/>
But its not even half the feeling as hearing you shine<br/>
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday<br/>
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles<br/>
I ask "Y" sometimes like a fucking vowel<br/>
But hitting tree's everyday like a fucking owl<br/>
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds<br/>
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.<br/>
So I could see you smile<br/>
I-I know you can see me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do<br/>
Don't look down, its an impossible view<br/>
Spread your wings, aerial
