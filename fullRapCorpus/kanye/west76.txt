<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I love it though<br/>
I love it though, you know<br/>
<br/>
Uh put your hands to the constellations<br/>
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation<br/>
I know I'm preaching to the congregation<br/>
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan<br/>
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting<br/>
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation<br/>
<br/>
May the Lord forgive us<br/>
May the gods be with us<br/>
In that magic hour I seen good Christians make brash decisions<br/>
Oh she do it, what happened to Religion?<br/>
Oh she lose it<br/>
She putting on her make-up<br/>
She casually allure<br/>
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour<br/>
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more<br/>
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off<br/>
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme<br/>
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a Jumbotron<br/>
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wanted, huh?"<br/>
Why we argue anyway, oh I forgot it's summertime<br/>
<br/>
Put your hands to the constellations<br/>
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation<br/>
I know I'm preaching to the congregation<br/>
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan (Satan, Satan, Satan)<br/>
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting<br/>
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation<br/>
<br/>
When the sun go down it's the magic hour<br/>
The magic hour<br/>
And outta all the colours that'll fill up the skies<br/>
You got green on your mind<br/>
I can see it in your eyes<br/>
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?<br/>
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up<br/>
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up<br/>
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us<br/>
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat<br/>
I ordered the jerk, she said, "You are what you eat."<br/>
You see I always loved that sense of humour<br/>
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was<br/>
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme<br/>
That's "Dior Homme" not "Dior, homie"<br/>
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?<br/>
You love me for me could you be more phony?<br/>
<br/>
Put your hands to the constellations<br/>
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation<br/>
Haven't said a word,<br/>
Haven't said a word to me this evening<br/>
Cat got your tongue?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone<br/>
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone<br/>
Stretch limousine, sippin' Ros√© all alone<br/>
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own<br/>
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character<br/>
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender<br/>
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders<br/>
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired<br/>
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder<br/>
We still speedin', runnin' signs like they don't matter<br/>
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad<br/>
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag<br/>
Therefore G4s at the Clearport<br/>
When it come to tools, fool I'm a Pep Boy<br/>
When it came to dope, I was quick to export<br/>
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport<br/>
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport<br/>
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud<br/>
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from<br/>
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne<br/>
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms<br/>
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns<br/>
I shed a tear before the night's over<br/>
God bless the man I put this ice over<br/>
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over<br/>
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller<br/>
I'm makin' love to the angel of death<br/>
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps
