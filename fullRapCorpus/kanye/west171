<i>[Intro - Kanye West]</i><br/>
You just popped in the Kanye West<br/>
Get right for the summer workout tape<br/>
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly<br/>
you might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player<br/>
Man, at least a dude wit' a car<br/>
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach<br/>
Nobody wants a little tight ass!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West]</i><br/>
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and<br/>
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this<br/>
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave<br/>
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed<br/>
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed<br/>
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited<br/>
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick<br/>
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me<br/>
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name<br/>
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..<br/>
I came...<br/>
I came..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kanye West]</i><br/>
It's been a week without me<br/>
and she feel weak without me<br/>
She wanna talk it out but<br/>
Ain't nothin' to talk about<br/>
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out<br/>
then maybe we can work it out<br/>
Work it out (Come on) <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Work it out now<br/>
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Kanye West]</i><br/>
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette<br/>
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said get it wet<br/>
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH<br/>
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS<br/>

<i>[LiL Jon]</i><br/>
