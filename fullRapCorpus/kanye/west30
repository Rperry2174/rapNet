<i>[Chorus: Brandy]</i><br/>
I always knew that one day<br/>
They'd try to bring me down<br/>
Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down<br/>
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down<br/>
Down, way down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye]</i><br/>
We're going to mass today, we have to pray<br/>
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say<br/>
Since Pac passed away<br/>
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me<br/>
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything<br/>
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream<br/>
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is<br/>
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids<br/>
But they're gonna have to take my life 'fore they take my drive<br/>
'cause when I was barely living, that's what kept me alive<br/>
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time<br/>
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind<br/>
And get some lee way on the he say she say<br/>
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay<br/>
Spanish girls say "No hable ingl√©s"<br/>
And everybody want to run to me for their single<br/>
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help<br/>
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself<br/>
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself<br/>
Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself<br/>
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself<br/>
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help<br/>
Now I'll speak from the heart, you all fronting<br/>
Everybody feel a way about K but at least you all feel something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Brandy]</i><br/>
Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you<br/>
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way<br/>
forgetting it was that heaven let you. They tried to bring me down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 5X]</i>
