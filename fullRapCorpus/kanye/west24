<i>[Jamie Foxx]</i><br/>
She take my money when I'm in need<br/>
Yeah she's a trifling friend indeed<br/>
Oh she's a gold digger way over town<br/>
That digs on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(She gives me money)<br/>
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger (when I'm in need)<br/>
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas<br/>
(She gives me money)<br/>
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger (when I'm in need)<br/>
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas<br/>
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)<br/>
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)<br/>
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)<br/>
Get down girl gone head<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Cutie the bomb<br/>
Met her at a beauty salon<br/>
With a baby Louis Vuitton<br/>
Under her underarm<br/>
She said I can tell you rock<br/>
I can tell by your charm<br/>
Far as girls you got a flock<br/>
I can tell by your charm and your arm<br/>
But I'm looking for the one<br/>
Have you seen her?<br/>
My psychic told me she have an ass like Serena<br/>
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids<br/>
And I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz<br/>
OK get your kids but then they got their friends<br/>
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in<br/>
We all went to Den and then I had to pay<br/>
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid<br/>
You know why?<br/>
It take too much to touch her<br/>
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta<br/>
My best friend says she use to fuck with Usher<br/>
I don't care what none of y'all say I still love her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
18 years, 18 years<br/>
She got one of your kids, got you for 18 years<br/>
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids<br/>
His baby mamma car and crib is bigger than his<br/>
You will see him on TV any given Sunday<br/>
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai<br/>
She was supposed to buy your shorty TYCO with your money<br/>
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money<br/>
She walking around looking like Michael with your money<br/>
Should've got that insured got GEICO for your money, money, money<br/>
If you ain't no punk holla we want prenup<br/>
WE WANT PRENUP! Yeah<br/>
It's something that you need to have<br/>
'Cause when she leave yo ass she gon' leave with half<br/>
18 years, 18 years<br/>
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Now I ain't saying you're a gold digger you got needs<br/>
You don't want your dude to smoke but he can't buy weed<br/>
You go out to eat, he can't pay y'all can't leave<br/>
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves<br/>
But why y'all washing watch him<br/>
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun<br/>
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes<br/>
This week he mopping floors, next week it's the fries<br/>
So, stick by his side<br/>
I know this dude's balling but yeah that's nice<br/>
And they gone keep calling and trying<br/>
But you stay right girl<br/>
And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl<br/>
<br/>
Get down girl go head get down<br/>
Get down girl go head get down<br/>
Get down girl go head get down<br/>
Get down girl go head<br/>
(lemme hear that back)
