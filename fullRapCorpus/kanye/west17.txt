<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
We in the streets playa, getcha mail<br/>
It's only two places you'll end up - either dead or in jail<br/>
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go<br/>
Now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas, boostas, hoes<br/>
Everybody, fuck that<br/>
Still nowhere to go...sill nowhere to go..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Two words, United States, no love, no brakes<br/>
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks<br/>
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules<br/>
Presidential scandals, everybody MOVE<br/>
Two words, Mos Def, K West, hot shit<br/>
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this<br/>
Game ball, lock shit, dump off, cock shit<br/>
We won't stop shit, everybody MOVE<br/>
Two words, BK , NY, bedstuy<br/>
Two hawks, too hungry, too many, that's why<br/>
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play<br/>
Every traffic, one lane, everybody MOVE<br/>
Two words, Mos Def, black check, hot shit<br/>
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this<br/>
Game point lock, long pump cocked<br/>
We won't stop, everybody MOVE<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye West (Harlem Boys Choir)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[1]</i> - Now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas (Throw your hands up high)<br/>
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)<br/>
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2]</i> - and keep ya hands up bustless, bustas (Till they reach the sky)<br/>
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)<br/>
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West (Harlem Boys Choir)]</i><br/>
Aiyyo, two words, Chi town, South side, world wide<br/>
Cuz I, rep that, till I, fuckin die<br/>
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats<br/>
One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, "Gimme that"<br/>
I am limelight, Blueprint, 5 Mics<br/>
Go getters rhyme like, shoulda been signed twice<br/>
Most imitated, Grammy nominated<br/>
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated<br/>
Barbershop, playa hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it<br/>
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in<br/>
Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy<br/>
So I live by two words, "Fuck you, pay me"<br/>
Screamin, Jesus save me<br/>
You know how the game be<br/>
I can't let em change me<br/>
Cuz on Judgment Day, you gon blame me<br/>
Look God, it's the same me<br/>
I (Throw) basically know now (Your) we could (Up) racially profile (High)<br/>
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and hoe down (ohhhhhh)<br/>
Plus I got a whole city to hold down (ohhhhhh)<br/>
From the bottom to the top<br/>
The only place to go down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2nd verse]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Freeway]</i><br/>
Two words, Freeway, two letters, A-R<br/>
Turn y'all rap niggaz into two words, fast runners<br/>
Like Jackie Jurner, you better sleep with your burner<br/>
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car<br/>
My God, two words, no guns, break arms<br/>
Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul<br/>
Free...young bars, fresh men of the Roc<br/>
Left the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs<br/>
and broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself<br/>
Have you screamin out four words "Send for the Lord"<br/>
Two words, Freeway's slightly retarded<br/>
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad..<br/>
