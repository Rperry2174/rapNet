<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
(Did you realize<br/>
That you were a champion?<br/>
In their eyes)<br/>
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib<br/>
Just a little somethin' show you how we live<br/>
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious<br/>
That's that shit<br/>
So if you're gonna do it, do it just like this<br/>
(Did you realize<br/>
That you were a champion?<br/>
In their eyes)<br/>
<br/>
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?<br/>
You don't see just how fly my style is?<br/>
I don't see why I need a stylist<br/>
When I shop so much I can speak Italian<br/>
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids<br/>
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects<br/>
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit<br/>
My dad'll say "When you see clothes close your eyelids"<br/>
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son<br/>
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones<br/>
'cause every summer he'll get some<br/>
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from<br/>
And I don't know what he did for dough<br/>
But he'd sent me back to school with a new wardrobe and hey!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
When it feel like living's harder than dyin'<br/>
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'<br/>
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion<br/>
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'<br/>
'cause who the kids gonna listen to? Huh?<br/>
I guess me if it isn't you<br/>
Last week I paid a visit to the institute<br/>
They got the Drop Out keepin' kids in the school<br/>
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do<br/>
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle<br/>
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems<br/>
Like I dropped out of P.E.<br/>
They used to feel invisible<br/>
Now they know they invincible<br/>
<br/>
(Did you realize<br/>
That you were a champion?<br/>
In their eyes)<br/>
This is the story of a champion<br/>
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns<br/>
Stand up stand up! Here he comes<br/>
Tell me what it takes to be number one?<br/>
Tell me what it takes to be number one?<br/>
This is the story of a champion<br/>
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns<br/>
Stand up stand up! Here he comes<br/>
Tell me what it takes to be number one?<br/>
Tell me what it takes to be number one?<br/>
<br/>
