<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Like we always do at this time<br/>
I go for mine, I got to shine<br/>
Now throw your hands up in the sky<br/>
I g-go for mine, I got to shine<br/>
Now throw your hands up in the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - T-Pain:]</i><br/>
I'm gonna get on this TV mama, I'm gonna<br/>
I'm gonna put shit down<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Hey, I'm good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 Kanye West]</i><br/>
Welcome to the good life<br/>
Where niggas that sell D<br/>
Won't even get pulled over in they new V<br/>
The good life, let's go on a living' spree<br/>
Shit they say the best things in life are free<br/>
The good life, it feel like Atlanta<br/>
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami<br/>
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ah<br/>
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)<br/>
So I roll through good<br/>
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari<br/>
And she got the goods<br/>
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry<br/>
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned<br/>
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's<br/>
50 told me go 'head switch the style up<br/>
And if they hate then let 'em hate<br/>
And watch the money pile up, the good life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine<br/>
Now throw your hands up in the sky<br/>
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine<br/>
Now throw your hands up in the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - T-Pain]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 Kanye West]</i><br/>
Welcome to the good life<br/>
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV<br/>
Cause they got more (Ass than the models)<br/>
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles<br/>
Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo<br/>
The good life, it feel like Houston<br/>
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.<br/>
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye<br/>
Ayy, this is the good life<br/>
Welcome to the good life<br/>
<br/>
Homie, tell me what's good<br/>
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood<br/>
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?<br/>
(I wish a nigga would)<br/>
He probably think he could, but, but<br/>
I don't think he should<br/>
50 told me go 'head switch the style up<br/>
And if they hate then let 'em hate<br/>
And watch the money pile up, the good life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - T-Pain]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane<br/>
While getting' some brain<br/>
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"<br/>
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz<br/>
Having' money's not everything, not having it is<br/>
I was splurging' on trizz<br/>
But when I get my card back activated<br/>
I'm back to Vegas cause<br/>
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it<br/>
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain]</i><br/>
Is the good life better than the life I live<br/>
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy<br/>
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby<br/>
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky<br/>
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh<br/>
I'm good
