<i>[Intro: Jay-Z (Kanye)]</i><br/>
<i>[laughing]</i><br/>
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost<br/>
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker<br/>
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room<br/>
'Cause they don't fucking..<br/>
<br/>
(I'd like to propose a toast)<br/>
(I said toast motherfucker)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye]</i><br/>
And I am (here's to the roc)<br/>
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (here's to Rocafella)<br/>
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky (here's to the roc)<br/>
This is the last call for alcohol, for the... (here's to Rocafella)<br/>
So get your ass up off the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac<br/>
The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc<br/>
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame<br/>
And come back next year with the whole fucking game<br/>
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top<br/>
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop<br/>
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself<br/>
Rocafella's only niggaz that help<br/>
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair<br/>
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here<br/>
They say he bourgie, he big-headed<br/>
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is<br/>
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds<br/>
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas<br/>
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested<br/>
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir<br/>
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir<br/>
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest<br/>
But all they got left is this guy called West<br/>
Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def<br/>
Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z<br/>
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh<br/>
It come out sweeter than old Sadie<br/>
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards<br/>
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards<br/>
And I was almost famous, now everybody loves Kanye<br/>
I'm almost Raymond'<br/>
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?<br/>
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him<br/>
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine<br/>
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme<br/>
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem<br/>
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams<br/>
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed<br/>
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh<br/>
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more<br/>
You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more<br/>
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more<br/>
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga<br/>
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don<br/>
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom<br/>
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards<br/>
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars<br/>
I went to the malls and I balled too hard<br/>
'Oh my god, is that a Black Card?'<br/>
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term<br/>
African American Express<br/>
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell<br/>
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to<br/>
Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit<br/>
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
"... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
So this A&amp;R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop<br/>
picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him<br/>
I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do<br/>
I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?"<br/>
I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."<br/>
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone<br/>
going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats<br/>
And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers<br/>
cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with<br/>
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID<br/>
And No ID told him, "look man, you wanna mess with Kanye<br/>
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"<br/>
<i>[No ID:]</i> "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"<br/>
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not<br/>
but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer<br/>
<i>[Hiphop:]</i> "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper",<br/>
I'm like oh shit<br/>
I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also<br/>
People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production<br/>
But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here<br/>
So you know. After they picked that Truth beat<br/>
I was figuring I was gonna do some more work<br/>
But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago<br/>
I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts<br/>
just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy<br/>
get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something<br/>
or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then<br/>
I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample<br/>
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like "oh, yo that shit is crazy<br/>
Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty."<br/>
And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me<br/>
so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time<br/>
and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like<br/>
with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style<br/>
when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'<br/>
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album<br/>
I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound<br/>
You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time<br/>
I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with<br/>
Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm<br/>
sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did<br/>
for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he<br/>
gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I<br/>
came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "oh<br/>
you a real soulful dude" <i>[Jay-Z: "you a real soulful dude"]</i>. And he<br/>
uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got<br/>
to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> "check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"<br/>
"tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking<br/>
like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't<br/>
want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my<br/>
personal opinion. So he asked me, "what you think of it?"<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> "so what you thinkin?"<br/>
And I was like, "man that shit tite,"<br/>
you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train<br/>
man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just<br/>
in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got<br/>
acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like<br/>
poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one<br/>
of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through<br/>
my production company, but he ended up going straight with the<br/>
company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad<br/>
news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at<br/>
the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took<br/>
that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about<br/>
ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal<br/>
with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to<br/>
<i>[Mother:]</i> "Come on, let's just go"<br/>
Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.<br/>
I remember I pulled up<br/>
<i>[Mother:]</i> "Kanye, baby, we're here",<br/>
I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a<br/>
bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and<br/>
the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'<br/>
And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up<br/>
there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I<br/>
played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone<br/>
he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at<br/>
that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket<br/>
hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said<br/>
"yo play that one beat for him." And I played 'Heart of the City.' And<br/>
really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.<br/>
<i>[Hiphop:]</i> "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here".<br/>
And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that<br/>
GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of<br/>
them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen<br/>
Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like "yo what's up I'm Kanye."<br/>
<i>[Dame:]</i> "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"<br/>
"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?<br/>
Yo, this nigga got classics"<br/>
<i>[Dame:]</i> "Jay got classics, G."<br/>
You know I ain't talkin shit.<br/>
I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm<br/>
still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show<br/>
The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my<br/>
eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all<br/>
these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one<br/>
thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be<br/>
Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton<br/>
sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John<br/>
Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the<br/>
time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I<br/>
spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical<br/>
shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his<br/>
eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap<br/>
was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.<br/>
He said "man that was tite."<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> "That, that was cool. That was hot."<br/>
That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.<br/>
Okay, fast forward.<br/>
So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just<br/>
took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship<br/>
with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my<br/>
career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me<br/>
to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at<br/>
this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had<br/>
relationships with all these A&amp;R's, and they wanted beats from me, so<br/>
they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound<br/>
like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them<br/>
these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll<br/>
be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy<br/>
'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever<br/>
Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they<br/>
didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&amp;R's that fucked<br/>
with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the<br/>
company that'll say "naw." Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my<br/>
nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man<br/>
<i>[Jessica:]</i> "Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."<br/>
I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up<br/>
"Y'all niggaz is stupid". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.<br/>
The nigga that was behind me, I mean,<br/>
he wasn't even a nigga, you know?<br/>
The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol<br/>
Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.<br/>
<i>[Joe:]</i> "We gonna change the game, buddy."<br/>
Dame was like, "yo you got a deal with Capitol,<br/>
okay man, just make sure it's not wack."<br/>
<i>[Dame:]</i> "you gotta make sure it's not wack."<br/>
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to<br/>
play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and<br/>
Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll<br/>
never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'<br/>
"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow<br/>
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now<br/>
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."<br/>
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So<br/>
I play that song for him, and he's like "oh shit"<br/>
<i>[Dame:]</i> "Oh shit it's not even wack."<br/>
"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."<br/>
<i>[Dame:]</i> "it's actually kinda hot."<br/>
Like they still weren't looking at me<br/>
like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole<br/>
album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and<br/>
save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's<br/>
like "yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick"<br/>
<i>[Dame:]</i> "you don't wanna catch a brick"<br/>
You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.<br/>
I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with<br/>
that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was<br/>
already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you<br/>
know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I<br/>
was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm<br/>
not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer<br/>
rapper" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--<br/>
the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do<br/>
man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio<br/>
sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes<br/>
man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said<br/>
"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"<br/>
<i>[Mel:]</i> "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."<br/>
And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested<br/>
and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying<br/>
to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I<br/>
called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"
