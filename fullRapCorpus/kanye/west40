<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Diamonds are forever<br/>
They won't leave in the night<br/>
I've no fear that they might<br/>
Desert me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)<br/>
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)<br/>
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.<br/>
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......<br/>
<br/>
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic<br/>
Vegas on acid,<br/>
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses<br/>
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz<br/>
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does<br/>
he write his own rhymes, so sort of<br/>
I think 'em<br/>
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up<br/>
Damn, is he really that caught up?<br/>
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?<br/>
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder<br/>
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche<br/>
- its for yourself that's important<br/>
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men<br/>
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan<br/>
Excuse me,<br/>
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)<br/>
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)<br/>
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.<br/>
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......<br/>
<br/>
I was sick about awards<br/>
Couldn't nobody cure me<br/>
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry<br/>
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them<br/>
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them<br/>
What more can you ask for?<br/>
The international assholes nah<br/>
Who complains about what he is owed?<br/>
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old<br/>
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul<br/>
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,<br/>
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane<br/>
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name<br/>
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane<br/>
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown<br/>
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown<br/>
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down<br/>
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)<br/>
My father Ben said I need Jesus<br/>
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)<br/>
The preacher said we need leaders<br/>
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic<br/>
<br/>
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it<br/>
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it<br/>
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic<br/>
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic<br/>
After debris settles and the dust get swept off<br/>
Big K pick up where young Hov left off<br/>
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off<br/>
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of<br/>
A&amp;R's lookin' like "pssh we messed up"<br/>
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up<br/>
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up<br/>
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up<br/>
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back<br/>
That'll be the same day I give the game back<br/>
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"<br/>
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back<br/>
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"<br/>
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen<br/>
R-r-r-right here stands a-man<br/>
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)<br/>
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)<br/>
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.<br/>
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)<br/>
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
