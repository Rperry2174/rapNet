<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Come and have a good time with G-O-D<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T 1:]</i><br/>
I believe there's a God above me<br/>
I'm just the God of everything else<br/>
I put hoes in everything else<br/>
New God Flow, fuck everything else<br/>
Supreme dope dealer, write it in BOLD LETTERS<br/>
They love a nigga spirit like Pac at the Coachella<br/>
They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella<br/>
But I was good with the yay as a wholeseller<br/>
I think it's good that Ye got a blow dealer<br/>
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer<br/>
I came up more, for more than just to rhyme with him<br/>
Think '99, when Puff would've had Shyne with him<br/>
(matching Daytona's Rose Gold on us)<br/>
Going Ham in Ibiza done took a toll on us<br/>
Well since you over do it, imma pour more<br/>
Well if you going coupe, I'm going four door(wooo)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shake that body, party that body(that's rare nigga)<br/>
Shake that body, party that body(Ric Flair nigga)<br/>
Shake that body, party that body(yeah nigga)<br/>
Come and have a good time with G-O-D(yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Shake that body, party that body(woaa)<br/>
Shake that body, party that body(woaa)<br/>
Shake that body, party that body(it's a New God Flow)<br/>
Come and have a good time with G-O-D<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T 2:]</i><br/>
Step on they necks till they can't breathe<br/>
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams<br/>
They say death multiplies by three's<br/>
Lined them all up and let's just see<br/>
Fuck 'em Ye, fuck 'em Ye<br/>
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier'<br/>
They shit is shopping at Target'<br/>
My shit is luxury Balmain<br/>
I'm Balling, I'm all red<br/>
A nick sold in the park then I want in<br/>
What's a king without a crown nigga<br/>
What's a circus without you clown niggas<br/>
What's a brick from an outta town nigga<br/>
When you flood and you can drown niggas<br/>
It's the GOOD Music golden child<br/>
M-A dollar sign can't nobody hold me down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Come and have a good time with G-O-D<br/>
<br/>
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man<br/>
But these new Yeezys jumped over the jump man<br/>
Went from most hated to the champion god flow<br/>
I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know<br/>
I'm living three dreams:<br/>
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King's, Rodney King's<br/>
Cause we can't get along, no resolution<br/>
Till we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston<br/>
Cars, money, girls and the clothes<br/>
Aww man, you sold your soul<br/>
Naww man, mad people was frontin'<br/>
Aww man, made something from nothing<br/>
Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through<br/>
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you<br/>
What has the world come to, I'm from the 312<br/>
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true<br/>
Like "Where did God go?" In his Murcielago<br/>
From working McDonald's, barely paying the car note<br/>
He even got enough to get his mama a condo<br/>
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom<br/>
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week<br/>
Man the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street<br/>
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us<br/>
We got green in our eyes, follow my Erick Sermon<br/>
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?<br/>
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?<br/>
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?<br/>
And went to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?<br/>
In Jesus name, let the choir say<br/>
"I'm on fire ay," that's what Richard Pryor say<br/>
And we annihilate anybody that violate<br/>
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire Ye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Shake that body, party that body<br/>
Come and have a good time with G-O-D<br/>
<br/>
GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music<br/>
And all my niggas say, GOOD Music<br/>
And all my ladies say, GOOD Music<br/>
I don't know what I've been told<br/>
(I don't know what I've been told)<br/>
If you get fresh, you get all the hoes<br/>
(If you get fresh, you get all the hoes)<br/>
I'm way fresher than all my foes<br/>
(I'm way fresher than all my foes)<br/>
Somebody please pick out they clothes<br/>
(Somebody please pick out they clothes)<br/>
And all my niggas say, GOOD Music<br/>
And all my ladies say, GOOD Music<br/>
Who running shit today, GOOD Music<br/>
Who running shit today, GOOD Music
