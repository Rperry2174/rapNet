<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I been waiting for a minute<br/>
For my lady<br/>
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes<br/>
I been living without limits<br/>
As far as my business<br/>
I'm the only one that's in control<br/>
I been feeling all I've given<br/>
For my children<br/>
I will die for those I love<br/>
God, I'm willing<br/>
To make this my mission<br/>
Give up the women<br/>
Before I lose half of what I own<br/>
I been thinking<br/>
About my vision<br/>
Pour out my feelings<br/>
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul<br/>
The layers to my soul<br/>
Revealing the layers to my soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up<br/>
Can't let them get to me<br/>
And even though I always fuck my life up<br/>
Only I can mention me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
See, before I let you go<br/>
One last thing I need to let you know<br/>
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than<br/>
This nigga when he off his Lexapro<br/>
Remember that last time in Mexico<br/>
Remember that last time, the episode<br/>
Asking me why the hell I text in code<br/>
Four times that you say don't text me hoe<br/>
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe<br/>
Now we finna lose all self-control<br/>
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me<br/>
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store<br/>
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end<br/>
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe<br/>
Yeah, I'mma have the laugh in the end<br/>
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe<br/>
And I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up<br/>
Can't let them get to me<br/>
And even though I always fuck my life up<br/>
Only I can mention me<br/>
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up<br/>
Can't let them get to me<br/>
And even though I always fuck my life up<br/>
Only I can mention me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Section 25 &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
See through the veil<br/>
And forget all of your cares<br/>
Throw them, throw them away<br/>
Don't stop your loving<br/>
Don't stop for nothing<br/>
No, not for nothing<br/>
They don't wanna see me love you<br/>
Nah, don't stop it<br/>
They always love it<br/>
They always wanna<br/>
They don't wanna see me love you<br/>
They don't wanna see me love you<br/>
They don't wanna see me love you<br/>
They don't wanna see me love you<br/>
See through the veil<br/>
And forget all your cares<br/>
Throw them, throw them away<br/>
Oh, life's a feeling<br/>
Oh, the body's a feeling
