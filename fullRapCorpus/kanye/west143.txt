I, you don't need, need to ever write<br/>
I read your last message at least a thousand times<br/>
At least a thousand, least a thousand times<br/>
Alright, alright, alright<br/>
Why did you ever listen to people tryna hate on you<br/>
At least you know there's nothing new<br/>
<br/>
Stop everything you're doing now<br/>
Cause baby, you're awesome<br/>
So awesome<br/>
You look too good to be at work<br/>
You feel too good to ever hurt<br/>
I hope you're ready for tonight<br/>
I'm gon' cook, you'll be dessert<br/>
You can't be still<br/>
I gotta move, I gotta dance<br/>
I gotta live, I gotta love<br/>
I gotta hope, I got a chance<br/>
Cause baby, you're awesome<br/>
<br/>
You don't need to listen to your manager<br/>
You're way too hot for them to handle you<br/>
Baby, not for nothing, I know you're lookin' for somethin'<br/>
And I got it, why you frontin' on me?<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you<br/>
Than something with somebody new<br/>
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you<br/>
Than something with somebody new<br/>
<br/>
Stop everything you're doing now<br/>
Cause baby you're awesome<br/>
Don't let nobody bring you down<br/>
You're so awesome<br/>
You're so out the park<br/>
You're so after dark<br/>
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right<br/>
<br/>
You're so freakin' tight<br/>
I know you must be tired<br/>
Of running through my mind<br/>
Can I come inside?<br/>
Cause baby I'm awesome, also<br/>
I'm also awesome, also<br/>
I'm also awesome, y'all know<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you<br/>
Than something with somebody new<br/>
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you<br/>
Than something with somebody new<br/>
<br/>
Stop everything you're doing now<br/>
Cause baby you're awesome<br/>
Don't let nobody bring you down<br/>
You're so awesome<br/>
You're so out the park<br/>
You're so after dark<br/>
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
