Wished I had told<br/>
Ooh was (the) only one<br/>
But it's too late, it's too late<br/>
He's gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi<br/>
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J<br/>
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis<br/>
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay<br/>
BROTHER NUMPSAY!  Groupies sound too choosy<br/>
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies<br/>
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays<br/>
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Too late, we, gone - we strivin home<br/>
Gone - we ride on chrome<br/>
It's too late<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Y'all don't want no prob from me<br/>
What you rappers could get is a job from me<br/>
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn<br/>
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr<br/>
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn<br/>
Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to "Let it Burn"<br/>
Plus he already got three chil'run<br/>
Arguin over babysitters like, "Bitch - it's yo' turn!"<br/>
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you<br/>
Even your superficial raps is super official<br/>
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on<br/>
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on<br/>
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long<br/>
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We strivin home, gone<br/>
<i>[Cam]</i> I ride on chrome...<br/>
We strivin home, gone<br/>
<i>[Cam]</i> Killa, I ride on chrome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cam'Ron]</i><br/>
Knock knock, who's there?  Killa Cam, Killa who?<br/>
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true<br/>
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer<br/>
Well here's the deal ma we goin to the dealer booth<br/>
No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof<br/>
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof<br/>
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag<br/>
Dag, niggaz still doin puff puff pass<br/>
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em<br/>
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit<br/>
Y'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum<br/>
An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)<br/>
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)<br/>
My last girl want me back then I'm on<br/>
Fine stay, you got the grind hey<br/>
Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)<br/>
Yes I know you wanna see my demise<br/>
Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise<br/>
Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes<br/>
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit<br/>
And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me<br/>
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and<br/>
You can ask George or Regina<br/>
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We strivin home, I ride on chrome<br/>
Listen homeboy move on<br/>
That's your best bet, why's that?<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, yo, yo<br/>
I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone<br/>
And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone<br/>
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon<br/>
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on<br/>
But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong<br/>
Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on<br/>
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head<br/>
Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds<br/>
So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed<br/>
And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread<br/>
And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts<br/>
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks<br/>
But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib<br/>
And rented "Gone With the Wind," cause I'da gone about 10<br/>
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar<br/>
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car<br/>
And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far<br/>
And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars<br/>
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes<br/>
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[long instrumental pause]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West imitating "The Show" at first]</i><br/>
Uh-uh-uh<br/>
Uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn<br/>
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm<br/>
Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out<br/>
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out<br/>
And that make me wanna get my advance out<br/>
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house<br/>
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind<br/>
Kanye step away from the lime-<br/>
-light, like, when I was on the grind<br/>
In the "One, Nine, Nine, Nine"<br/>
Before, model chicks was bendin over or<br/>
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man<br/>
If I could just get one beat on Hova<br/>
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa<br/>
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old<br/>
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro<br/>
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural<br/>
Fired a week later the manager count the churros<br/>
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow<br/>
How we out in Europe, spendin Euros<br/>
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE<br/>
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on<br/>
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's<br/>
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free<br/>
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin<br/>
You'll sell everything includin the mannequin<br/>
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston<br/>
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm<br/>
Shorty's at the door cause they need more<br/>
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs<br/>
They said sorry Mr. West is gone!
