Turn up ya radio now I suggest<br/>
It's the remix and we the best<br/>
Raheem DeVaughn and Kanye West<br/>
<br/>
Man, hold your head high <br/>
Cause it's the test<br/>
And what don't kill you<br/>
Make you stronger, my brotha<br/>
So when you feelin' down, my brotha<br/>
And getta mournin' the lost of your mother<br/>
Heaven's got a brand-new angel shining down like bright lights...<br/>
<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
B.C.I. to Chi Town<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
See my name like the Hollywood sign<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
And you can hate it, but I'm still gon shine<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
I'm still gon shine<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
Yeah, I'm still gon shine<br/>
Yeah, still gon shine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raheem Devaughn]</i><br/>
My name's been spreadin' lik a rumor<br/>
In the hood, I'm buzzin' like a tumor<br/>
G-Girl, you ain't gettin' no paper<br/>
I know that you're a star-chaser.<br/>
<br/>
You hooked, You want, You love the...<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
Maybe it's the way I entertain<br/>
Maybe it's the way I shine like...<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
But you thrist, you crave, you yearn the<br/>
flashing light<br/>
<br/>
And now you drunk <br/>
Cause you can't hold yo liquor<br/>
Talkin' bout you came in the club wit yo n*&amp;&amp;a<br/>
Askin' can you leave wit me, Go figure!<br/>
But I would rather leave wit Alicia Keys<br/>
<br/>
Southern paparizzi, NO...<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
No pictures, No videos<br/>
That be a good look scenrio<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
They caught me on the red carpet though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raheem Devaughn]</i><br/>
As I recall, I know you love to show off<br/>
But I never thought that you would take it this far<br/>
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I know it's been a while, sweetheart<br/>
We hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing<br/>
I know I was foul bay-bay,<br/>
A-bay-bay, late-ly you been all on my brain<br/>
<br/>
And if somebody would've told me a month ago<br/>
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know<br/>
If somebody would've told me a year ago<br/>
It'd go, get this difficult<br/>
<br/>
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA<br/>
Like Martin with no Gina<br/>
Like a flight with no visa<br/>
First class with the seat back, I still see ya<br/>
In my past, you on the other side of the glass<br/>
Of my memory's museum,<br/>
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,<br/>
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raheem Devaughn]</i><br/>
As I recall, I know you love to show off<br/>
But I never thought that you would take it this far<br/>
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
<br/>
As you recall, you know I love to show off<br/>
But you never thought that I would take it this far<br/>
What do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
What do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the speakers shinin' like...<br/>
I'm on stage shinin' like...<br/>
I'm in the club shinin' like...<br/>
I'm in the hood shinin' like... <br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
<br/>
So put your shades on right<br/>
(Flashing lights, lights)<br/>
Cause I'm shinin' bright, like flashing...<br/>
(Lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights...fading)<br/>
LIGHTS!<br/>
I'm shinin'...Ohhh, Ohhh...<br/>
