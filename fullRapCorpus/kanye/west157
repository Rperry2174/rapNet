<i>[Verse 1 - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I think I've had enough<br/>
I might get a little drunk<br/>
I say what's on my mind<br/>
I might do a little time<br/>
Cause all of my kindness<br/>
Is taken for weakness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'<br/>
And we got three more days 'til Friday<br/>
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'<br/>
I swear I wish somebody would tell me<br/>
Ooh, that's all I want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Woke up an optimist<br/>
Sun was shinin', I'm positive<br/>
Then I heard you was talkin' trash<br/>
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Rihanna and Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'<br/>
And we got three more days 'til Friday<br/>
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'<br/>
I swear I wish somebody would tell me<br/>
Ooh, that's all I want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
And I know that you're up tonight<br/>
Thinkin', "how could I be so selfish?"<br/>
But you called 'bout a thousand times<br/>
Wondering where I've been<br/>
Now I know that you're up tonight<br/>
Thinkin' "how could I be so reckless?"<br/>
But I just can't apologize<br/>
I hope you can understand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
If I go to jail tonight<br/>
Promise you'll pay my bail<br/>
See they want to buy my pride<br/>
But that just ain't up for sale<br/>
See all of my kindness<br/>
Is taken for weakness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2 - Rihanna and Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'<br/>
And we got three more days 'til Friday<br/>
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'<br/>
I swear I wish somebody would tell me<br/>
Ooh, that's all I want
