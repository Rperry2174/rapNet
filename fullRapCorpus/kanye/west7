<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah Grandmama<br/>
Told you I won't let you down<br/>
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
When it comes to being true, at least true to me<br/>
One thing I found,one thing I found<br/>
Oh no you'll neva let me down,<br/>
Get up I get(down)<br/>
Get up I get(down)<br/>
Get up I get(down)<br/>
Get up I get(down)<br/>
Get up I get(down)<br/>
Get up I get(down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,<br/>
First had they ear now I hav they're heart,<br/>
Rappers came and went,<br/>
I've been hear from the start,<br/>
Seen them put it together<br/>
Watch them take it apart,<br/>
See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons<br/>
I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven<br/>
So when I reload, he holds #1 position<br/>
When u hot I'm hot<br/>
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin<br/>
It's plain to see<br/>
Nigga's can't f*** wit me<br/>
Cuz ima be that nigga fo life<br/>
This is not an image<br/>
This is God given<br/>
This is hard liven<br/>
Mixed wit crystal sipping<br/>
It's the most consistent<br/>
Hov<br/>
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and<br/>
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin<br/>
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap<br/>
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma<br/>
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat<br/>
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in<br/>
With that in my blood I was born to be different<br/>
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership<br/>
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership<br/>
That's why I hear new music<br/>
And I just don't be feeling it<br/>
Racism still alive they just be concealing it<br/>
But I know they don't want me in the damn club<br/>
They even made me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club<br/>
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed<br/>
Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times<br/>
But in the land where nigga's praise<br/>
Yukons and getting paid<br/>
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved<br/>
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves<br/>
Noting sadder than that day my girl father past away<br/>
So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter<br/>
And u know I gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up<br/>
And I know that u were smiling when u see that car I bought her<br/>
And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up<br/>
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye<br/>
Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye<br/>
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die<br/>
I know a got angels watching me from the other side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[J.Ivy:]</i><br/>
We are all here for a reason on a particular path<br/>
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math<br/>
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious<br/>
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world<br/>
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls<br/>
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this<br/>
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him<br/>
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical<br/>
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument<br/>
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental<br/>
That's why I'm instrumental<br/>
Vibrations is what I'm into<br/>
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day<br/>
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte<br/>
I'm tryina give us "us free" like Cinque<br/>
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot<br/>
Determination, dedication, motivation<br/>
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations<br/>
When I say I can't, let you or self down<br/>
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff<br/>
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip<br/>
I would never, ever let you down<br/>
And when these words are found<br/>
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love<br/>
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf<br/>
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind<br/>
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme<br/>
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house<br/>
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth<br/>
A touch of God reigns out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z (Kanye West)]</i><br/>
Who else you know been hot this long,<br/>
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)<br/>
Started from nothing but he got this strong,<br/>
(The ROC is in the building)<br/>
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,<br/>
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,<br/>
Let you tell that man I'm falling,<br/>
Well somebody must've caught him,<br/>
Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,<br/>
Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,<br/>
More of dem on the way,<br/>
The Eight Wonder on the way,<br/>
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,<br/>
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,<br/>
Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,<br/>
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,<br/>
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,<br/>
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,<br/>
The way y'all all follow Jigga,<br/>
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,<br/>
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.
