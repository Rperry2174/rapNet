Yeah<br/>
<br/>
I'm on my way home<br/>
<br/>
They say home is where the hate is<br/>
My dome is where fate is<br/>
I stroll where souls get lost like vegas<br/>
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses<br/>
Pray to god that my arms reach the masses<br/>
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles<br/>
Rubberband together in cashless bundles<br/>
We wear struggling chains<br/>
Divided only hustle remains<br/>
Making sense of it we hustle for change<br/>
Revolution ain't a game<br/>
It's another name<br/>
For life fighting<br/>
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson<br/>
Hypes fighting for hits to heighten they hell<br/>
Don't he know he only get as high as he fell<br/>
Show money becomes bail<br/>
Relationships become jail<br/>
Children are unheld<br/>
I wish love was for sale<br/>
Behold the pale<br/>
Horse got me trapped like r. kel', I bail and it-<br/>
<br/>
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again<br/>
I'm on my way home<br/>
I left three days ago<br/>
But no one seems to know I'm gone<br/>
Home is where the hatred is<br/>
Home is filled with pain and it<br/>
Might not be such a bad idea if I never<br/>
Never went home again.
