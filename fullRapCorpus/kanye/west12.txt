<i>[Hook: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out<br/>
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out<br/>
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out<br/>
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out<br/>
Breathe in, breathe out<br/>
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out<br/>
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out<br/>
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap<br/>
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)<br/>
But is it cool to rap about gold<br/>
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)<br/>
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack<br/>
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack<br/>
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant<br/>
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again<br/>
And it's still about the Benjamins<br/>
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms<br/>
Strippers named Cinnamon<br/>
More chips than Pentium<br/>
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is<br/>
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks<br/>
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"<br/>
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?<br/>
What the hell was wrong with me dog?<br/>
Sing along with my y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out<br/>
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out<br/>
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out<br/>
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out<br/>
Breathe in, breathe out<br/>
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out<br/>
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out<br/>
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick<br/>
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick<br/>
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this<br/>
And givin' head is like a whale, using the toothpick'<br/>
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time<br/>
Act now and get some action for $free.99<br/>
Later on I might charge for m√©nage<br/>
Heard her man was the boss of the floss<br/>
But she still want to toss me the drawers<br/>
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy<br/>
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club<br/>
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug<br/>
She asked "Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?"<br/>
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man<br/>
Baby I fully understand<br/>
Let me help you with a plan<br/>
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga<br/>
Give ME some head, that'll really piss hI'm off<br/>

Yeah, breathe in, breathe out<br/>
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out<br/>
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out<br/>
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out<br/>
Breathe in, breathe out<br/>
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out<br/>
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out<br/>
When I pull a piece out niggas like "Peace out!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I blow past low class niggas with no cash<br/>
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask<br/>
So when I go fast popo just laugh<br/>
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash<br/>
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst<br/>
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon<br/>
Pullin' up in the Lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand<br/>
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous<br/>
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages<br/>
"K I need a free hand mammogram<br/>
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam<br/>
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"<br/>
So say my name like Candyman<br/>
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman<br/>
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave<br/>
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out<br/>
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out<br/>
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out<br/>
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out<br/>
Breathe in, breathe out<br/>
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out<br/>
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out<br/>
When I pull a piece out niggas like "Peace out!"<br/>
