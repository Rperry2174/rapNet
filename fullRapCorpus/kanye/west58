Why would she make calls out the blue<br/>
Now I'm awake, sleepless til noon<br/>
<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
Don't say you will<br/>
Unless you will<br/>
Hey hey hey hey <br/>
Don't say you will<br/>
Then play you will<br/>
I pray you will<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. So-Fly crash-lands in my room<br/>
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon<br/>
<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
Don't say you will<br/>
You will<br/>
Hey hey hey hey <br/>
Don't say you will<br/>
One day you will<br/>
I pray you will<br/>
<br/>
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul<br/>
Take off your cool then lose control<br/>
<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
Don't say you will<br/>
You will you will<br/>
Hey hey hey hey <br/>
Don't say you will<br/>
If you will<br/>
I pray you will<br/>
<br/>
I wish this song would really come true<br/>
I admit I still fantasize about you<br/>
About you<br/>
<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
Don't say you will<br/>
You will you will<br/>
Hey hey hey hey <br/>
Please say you will<br/>
For real<br/>
I pray you will
