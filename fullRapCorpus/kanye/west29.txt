<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I know it's past visiting hours<br/>
But can I please give her these flowers<br/>
The doctor dont wanna take procedures<br/>
He claim my heart can't take the anastesia<br/>
It'll send her body into a seizure<br/>
The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping,<br/>
Hey chick, im at a lost for words<br/>
What do you say at this time?<br/>
Remember when I was nine?<br/>
Tell her everything gone be fine?<br/>
But i'd be lying, the family crying<br/>
They want her to live, and she trying<br/>
I'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in<br/>
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid,<br/>
If Magic Johnson got a cure for A.I.D.S.<br/>
And all the broke muthafuckers past away<br/>
You tellin me if my grandma was in the N.B.A.<br/>
Right now she'd be ok?<br/>
But since she was just a secretary<br/>
Working for the church<br/>
For thirty five years<br/>
Things sposed to stop right here<br/>
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong,<br/>
Thats where I get my confidence from<br/>
I asked the nurse "did you do the research?"<br/>
She ask me, "can you sign some t-shirts?"<br/>
Bitch is you smokin reefer?<br/>
You dont see that we hurt<br/>
But still...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
...I smile<br/>
When roses come to see me<br/>
And I can't wait for a sunny day<br/>
(Im seeing it through your eyes)<br/>
Can't wait for the clouds to break<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
They outside of the emergency room, room<br/>
You can feel my heart beat, beat, beat<br/>
If she gone pull through<br/>
We gone find out soon<br/>
But right now she sleep, sleep, sleep<br/>
My mama say, they say she could pass away any day<br/>
Hey chick what these doctors know anyway<br/>
Let me see the X-rays<br/>
I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt<br/>
Cousin Kim took off for work<br/>
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Claire and Aunt Jean<br/>
So many Aunties, we could have an Auntie team<br/>
Feel like Amerie "Its this one thing"<br/>
When they said that she made it<br/>
You see the eyes gleam<br/>
I think we at an all time high<br/>
To get there we run, we fly, we drive<br/>
Coz with my family we know where home is<br/>
So instead of sending flowers<br/>
We the roses...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I smile<br/>
When roses come to see me<br/>
And I can't wait for a sunny day<br/>
(Im seeing it through your eyes)<br/>
Can't wait for the clouds to break<br/>
<br/>
Who brings the sunshine?<br/>
<br/>
Ohhhhh I smile<br/>
When roses come to see me<br/>
And I can't wait for a sunny day<br/>
(Im seeing it through your eyes)<br/>
Can't wait for the clouds to breaK
