<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I go, I go, ay ay, I go<br/>
Up in the morning, miss you bad<br/>
Sorry I ain't called you back<br/>
The same problem my father had<br/>
All his time, all he had, all he had<br/>
In what he dreamed<br/>
All his cash, market crashed<br/>
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that<br/>
Drops some stacks pops is good<br/>
Mama pass in Hollywood<br/>
If you ask, lost my soul<br/>
Driving fast, lost control<br/>
Off the road, jaw was broke<br/>
'Member we all was broke<br/>
'Member I'm coming back<br/>
I'll be taking all the stacks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Desiigner:]</i><br/>
I got broads in Atlanta<br/>
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta<br/>
Credit cards and the scammers<br/>
Hitting off licks in the bando<br/>
Black X6, Phantom<br/>
White X6 looks like a panda<br/>
Going out like Iâ€™m Montana<br/>
Hundred killers, hundred hammers<br/>
Black X6, Phantom<br/>
White X6, panda<br/>
Pockets swole, Danny<br/>
Selling bar, candy<br/>
Man I'm the macho like Randy<br/>
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy<br/>
Bitch nigga, pull up ya panty<br/>
Hope you killers understand me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I<br/>
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I<br/>
Taking all the stacks, oh<br/>
Stacks, oh<br/>
Taking all the stacks, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Desiigner:]</i><br/>
I got broads in Atlanta<br/>
Twisting dope, lean, and shit sipping Fanta<br/>
Credit cards and the scammers<br/>
Wake up Versace, shit life Desiigner<br/>
Whole bunch of lavish shit<br/>
They be asking round town who be clapping shit<br/>
I pulling up stuff in the Phantom ship<br/>
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit<br/>
Black X6, Phantom<br/>
White X6, killing on camera<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Caroline Shaw:]</i><br/>
How can I find you?<br/>
Who do you turn to?<br/>
How do I bind you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pastor T. L. Barrett:]</i><br/>
If I don't turn to you<br/>
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
