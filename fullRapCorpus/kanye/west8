<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh<br/>
I'm trying to catch the beat<br/>
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh<br/>
I'm trying to catch the beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Kanye West):]</i><br/>
Now, throw your motherfucking hands<br/>
GET 'EM HIGH<br/>
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man<br/>
GET 'EM HIGH<br/>
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands<br/>
KEEP 'EM HIGH<br/>
And if your losing your high then* smoke again<br/>
KEEP 'EM HIGH<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Now, my flow<br/>
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics<br/>
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics<br/>
My freshman year I was going through hella problems<br/>
'til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college<br/>
My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her why don't you kill me<br/>
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow my heart,<br/>
And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks<br/>
You ain't gotta guess who's back,<br/>
You see I'm so Chi that you thought it was bashful<br/>
But this bastard's flow will bash a skull<br/>
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Troy<br/>
And I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro<br/>
And I won't give you that money that you asking for<br/>
Why you think me and Dame cool? We're assholes!<br/>
That's why we hear your music in fast forward<br/>
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Kanye West)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Now who the hell is this?<br/>
E-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double D<br/>
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly<br/>
At NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus<br/>
Sent me a picture with her feeling on Candice<br/>
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis<br/>
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet<br/>
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend<br/>
His name Kweli<br/>
(You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib)<br/>
I mean<br/>
(That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib)<br/>
I mean<br/>
(You don't really know him, why is you lying)<br/>
You Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line<br/>
She's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines<br/>
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]</i><br/>
Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes<br/>
But never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out<br/>
And my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out<br/>
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo<br/>
Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?<br/>
She's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior<br/>
Always got something to say like an OK player hater<br/>
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet<br/>
Or chicks on Birth Control stuck to they arm like Nicorette<br/>
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes<br/>
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet<br/>
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate<br/>
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Common]</i><br/>
Get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke<br/>
A high filled with dope<br/>
You all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes<br/>
The real nigga quotes<br/>
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control,<br/>
Rap is not a used to but still got love,<br/>
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs<br/>
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show<br/>
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you<br/>
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you<br/>
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead<br/>
I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these<br/>
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys<br/>
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular<br/>
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her<br/>
Album, how come, you the hot garbage of<br/>
The year, It's clear your image is snooped up<br/>
Label got you souped up, telling you you're sick<br/>
Man you a dick with a loose nut<br/>
Video hard to watch like Medusa<br/>
Even your club record need a booster<br/>
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga<br/>
Read the infa, red across your head Imma bred King like Simba<br/>
Boulder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a MC with a temper<br/>
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way<br/>
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye<br/>
Spitting through wires and fires, MCs retiring<br/>
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Kanye West)]</i>
