<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Bloody murder, murder murder <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
The paper read murder, black on black murder<br/>
The paper read murder, black on black murder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry<br/>
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly<br/>
Strays from the same shade, nigga we on the same team<br/>
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing<br/>
All black everything, nigga you know my fresh code<br/>
I’m out here fightin’ for you, don’t increase my stress load<br/>
Niggas watchin’ the throne, very happy to be<br/>
Power to the people, when you see me, see you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
And I’m from the murder capital, where they murder for capital<br/>
Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon<br/>
Lookin’ at the news like damn I was just with him after school,<br/>
No shop class but half the school got a tool,<br/>
And I could die any day type attitude<br/>
Plus his little brother got shot reppin’ his avenue<br/>
It’s time for us to stop and re-define black power<br/>
41 souls murdered in 50 hours<br/>
<br/>
The paper read murder, black on black murder,<br/>
The paper read murder, black on black murder again<br/>
Murder again…<br/>
<br/>
Is it genocide?<br/>
Cause I can still hear his momma cry, know the family traumatized<br/>
Shots left holes in his face, bout piranha-size<br/>
The old pastor closed the cold casket<br/>
And said the church ain’t got enough room for all the tombs<br/>
It’s a war going on outside, we ain’t safe from<br/>
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go<br/>
314 soldiers died in Iraq<br/>
509 died in Chicago<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died<br/>
Real niggas just multiply<br/>
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die<br/>
So I’m out here celebratin’ my post demise<br/>
If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival<br/>
You gon’ end up pulling down niggas that look just like you<br/>
What up blood? What up cos?<br/>
It’s all black, I love us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
The paper read murder, black on black murder,<br/>
The paper read murder, black on black murder again<br/>
Black on black murder again<br/>
Black on black murder again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
It’s a celebration of black excellence<br/>
Black tie, black Maybachs<br/>
Black excellence, opulence, decadence<br/>
Tuxes next to the president, I’m present<br/>
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris<br/>
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb<br/>
Do you know who I am Clarice?<br/>
No cheap cologne whenever I “shh-shh”<br/>
Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success<br/>
The new black elite, they say my black card bear the mark of the beast<br/>
I repeat, my religion is the beat<br/>
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece, now please, domino, domino<br/>
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go<br/>
What’s up to Will, shoutout to O<br/>
That ain’t enough, we gon’ need a million more<br/>
Kick in the door, Biggie flow<br/>
I’m all dressed up with nowhere to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Yea it’s all messed up when it’s nowhere to go<br/>
So we won’t take the time out til we reach the T O P<br/>
From paroles to hold G’s, sold keys, low keys<br/>
We like the promised land of the OG’s<br/>
In the past if you picture events like a black tie<br/>
What’s the last thing you expect to see, black guys<br/>
What’s the life expectancy for black guys?<br/>
The system’s working effectively, that’s why<br/>
I’ll be a real man, take care of your son<br/>
Every problem you had before this day is now done<br/>
New crib, watch a movie<br/>
Cause ain’t nothin’ on the news but the blues<br/>
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci<br/>
Now ain’t nothin’ new but your shoes<br/>
Sunday morning, praise the Lord<br/>
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for<br/>
So let’s savor this moment, and take it to the floor<br/>
Black excellence, truly yours
