Some glad morning when this life is over,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
To a home on God's celestial shore,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
<br/>
I'll fly away, O Glory,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
<br/>
When the shadows of this life have flown,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
<br/>
I'll fly away, O Glory,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few more weary days and then,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
To a land where joy shall never end,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
<br/>
I'll fly away, O Glory,<br/>
I'll fly away.<br/>
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,<br/>
I'll fly away.
