Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
<br/>
Yo, I'm savant with the game<br/>
Go on, tell 'robi yo' name<br/>
Provide words that's heard, setting your body aflame<br/>
Ooh, you off the chain, I'm handling your terrain, your valley<br/>
Has me standing down to the follicle<br/>
'Bout half of this bottle full of reasons for us to ball<br/>
Calming violations and travel vacations, ma<br/>
Place on your fancy bra, go take them vestments off<br/>
Skin and my lips involved with licking a place that's on<br/>
Jedi<br/>
<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough love that I give to you?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough time that I give to you?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Tell me that you feel the same way I do<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Enough, enough, enough<br/>
<br/>
Is it an issue if I make you nut?<br/>
But there's no quality time 'cause I forever grind<br/>
This is not an excuse, I just wanna get loose<br/>
That's some nigga jargon, girl, you're making me harden<br/>
To the stone and granite statue, I'm prone to get at you<br/>
It's hard to break your defense, I guess I have to leap fence<br/>
And scale wall and break fall on a tree right by your window<br/>
Reward me for my efforts by rolling this indo<br/>
As I nibble your neck naughtily, sex is a big part of me<br/>
Agencies want to audit me, searches in for sodomy<br/>
My thrust bust artery, I know you're on to me<br/>
Just wanna have shenanigan, don't wanna make you mad again<br/>
So focus on the flattery you feel when I fring it<br/>
Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it<br/>
Dirty talk loud but they saying, "Fuck this shit"<br/>
At the queen's request, if it's gotta be, it's gotta be<br/>
<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough love that I give to you?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough time that I give to you?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Tell me that you feel the same way I do<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough love that I give to you?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough time that I give to you?<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Tell me that you feel the same way I do<br/>
Is this enough?<br/>
Is this enough?
