So many people, right now<br/>
Motivated to shit<br/>
Bull shit over some bull shit ass reasons<br/>
But we 'bout to put it inside of a love perspective like<br/>
Love it<br/>
<br/>
We do it all for the love y'all<br/>
Yeah, we do it all for the love y'all<br/>
Weither white, black, Spanish, ain't a thug y'all<br/>
We do it, we give it all for the love y'all<br/>

We do it, we do it all for the love y'all<br/>
We in the party, put your hands up<br/>

<br/>
Love getting down and I love a cool breeze<br/>
Love seein' checks from record companies<br/>
Love lovin' love 'cause I love what I do<br/>
And we do our thing for the one nine two<br/>
And the rest of the country 'cause we from there too<br/>
Makin' sure love is givin' when I get it from you<br/>
Everybody, we regulate the party and shit<br/>
Love it when I get a little rugged wit' it<br/>
Love the circumstance to make my dough flow right<br/>
Love rockin' mics plus the ill style nights<br/>
She does it real good but love'll make it mo' better<br/>
Got me kind of open in the DK sweater<br/>
Love when my peoples come home from jail bids<br/>
Really love women and I really love kids<br/>
Love tight gloves where the muisc just bang<br/>
Camp-ass with gas women or shorty got bangs<br/>
Lovin' it<br/>
Yo yo, I'm lovin' it<br/>
Love a women when she got a tight outfit<br/>
Outfit meaning outlook and disposition<br/>
You love it when a nigga cause a love composition<br/>
Love peanut butter and jelly on wheat<br/>
Wylin' out, makin' hot shit to hot beats<br/>
&gt;From Ohio to Poughkeepsie<br/>
&gt;From Phoenix to NC<br/>
&gt;From Cali to DC<br/>
Love it when the pressure falls righ on me<br/>
Love it when God keeps on overlookin'<br/>
Do a tight show so promoters keep bookin'<br/>
<br/>
We do it all for the love y'all<br/>
Yeah, we do it all for the love y'all<br/>
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all<br/>
&gt;From the heart inside of the heart y'all<br/>
we do it, we do it all for the love y'all<br/>
For real, for the love, for the love y'all<br/>
All my peoples in the ghettos, for the love y'all<br/>
All my peoples all around, for the love y'all<br/>
For the love love<br/>
<br/>
For my crews bomb, where my peoples still at<br/>
If they call me and I don't call back<br/>
For weeks at a time, love is still intact<br/>
Let's be big about it, and realize the fact<br/>
Love it, when the underdog comes through<br/>
Ghetto revalizer, overthrow these rules<br/>
Love it, when I get spared another day<br/>
Used to drink zay while my niggas weighed yay<br/>
Love it, when I gain control over this<br/>
Life is really bigger than the rolly on my wrist<br/>
Got a twist to this shit and the answer's inside<br/>
Sho as the world's small and the missisipi's wide<br/>
Had to rock a vest over unchoosed fest<br/>
Now I see people rockin' theirs in jets<br/>
Love it when my loved one really hold me down<br/>
Brand new flight and I'm takin' off ground<br/>
<br/>
We do it all for the love y'all<br/>
Check it out, we do it all for the love y'all<br/>
For the love y'all, for the love y'all<br/>
For the love, for the love y'all<br/>
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all<br/>
Yo, we do it all for the love y'all<br/>
For everybody, for the love for the love y'all<br/>
Weither white, black, Spanish, ain't a thug y'all<br/>
Yeah, we givin' y'all this shit, the love y'all<br/>
Just the love inside of the heart y'all<br/>
Yeah, for the love for the love y'all<br/>
