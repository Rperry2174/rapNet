<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
I had a dream about my man last night<br/>
And my man came by the studio<br/>
And his name is...<br/>
Busta Rhymes in effect, Shaheed is in effect<br/>
Phife Did-awg is in effect <br/>
Check it out and give me my 'spect<br/>
<br/>
I'm movin, yes I'm groovin cuz my mouth is on the motor<br/>
Use the Coast in the mornin to avoid the funky odor<br/>
Can't help bein funky, I'm the funky Abstract brotha<br/>
Funky in a sense, but I play the undacova<br/>
Once had a fettish, fettish for some booty<br/>
Now I'm gettin funky and my rappin, that's my duty<br/>
Brothas tend to jock on the style in particular<br/>
If you got the ego like some brothas, then I'll get with ya<br/>
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)<br/>
My motto in the 90's is be happy makin bucks<br/>
Girls love the jim, cuz it causes crazy friction<br/>
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction<br/>
I still understand the (uh!) cuz that's what I met her for<br/>
I'm hooked on the swings, so just call me the music whore<br/>
Women love the voice, brothas dig the lyrics<br/>
Quest the people's choice, we thrive it for the spirit<br/>
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensils<br/>
Write my rhymes straight up, don't get with no fancy stensils<br/>
The rhymes we get is sweet, we stay away from tart<br/>
Our perfection is at work, perkin up the art<br/>
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock<br/>
Your demise is comin up and I want your man to watch<br/>
Be the prime example, I deep instilled the sample<br/>
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle<br/>
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica<br/>
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a claker<br/>
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?<br/>
The crazy move faker, I used that to break her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vinia Mojica singing in the background]</i><br/>
Phife is in the house, Uncle Mike is in the house<br/>
Bob Power is in the house, Tim Latham is in the house<br/>
Wise Men is in the house, Brand Nubs is in the house<br/>
The J Beez, they in the house and De La, they in the house<br/>
<br/>
I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people<br/>
Please don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil<br/>
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket<br/>
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it<br/>
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action<br/>
The ladies of the '90's want more than satisfaction<br/>
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things<br/>
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring<br/>
I keep a tight net with my brothas Ken and Kenny <br/>
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty<br/>
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together<br/>
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever<br/>
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature<br/>
With the funky singin by Miss Vinia Mojica<br/>
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground<br/>
My people been up on Quest to long, no more will we be down<br/>
People tend to riff cuz they don't know the mental<br/>
People tend to bug cuz their beats are hard but gentle<br/>
Afro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun'<br/>
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and your comin to <br/>
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm<br/>
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain<br/>
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival<br/>
If flexin is your motive, then you don't like survival<br/>
The Abstract is speakin, the hard beats is reachin<br/>
The Black and Puerto Ricans<br/>
Cuz their butt naked, streakin through the ever murky streets <br/>
Of the urbanized areas<br/>
Blastin out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria<br/>
<br/>
Craig is in the house, Pete Rock is in the house<br/>
CL is in the house, Ultra Mag is in the house<br/>
Nice and Smooth is in the house, Big Daddy Kane is in the house<br/>
Beatnuts is in the house, Special Ed is in the house<br/>
<br/>
Yeah <i>[7X]</i><br/>
This one goes out to my man<br/>
Thanks alot Ron Carter on the bass<br/>
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass<br/>
Now check it out<br/>
Born into the 91 decade<br/>
You gotta say the Quest is on<br/>
And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on<br/>
And we out!
