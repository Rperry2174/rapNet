<i>[Red Alert:]</i><br/>
Check this out, Cool DJ Red Alert<br/>
With my man, Q-Tip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures<br/>
Looked at her sexual partner<br/>
Who acquainted her acquaintance<br/>
Five hours ago at a disco<br/>
She went lower than low, into limbo<br/>
A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo<br/>
She answered no, so she had to go...on with the program<br/>
Creedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name<br/>
But it seems that she's done the same<br/>
And now something has happened<br/>
Suddenly, she's been distracted<br/>
By something that has been attracted<br/>
She poked and poked and smacked at it<br/>
Then she broke down and she scratched it<br/>
Now, I think you understand<br/>
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps<br/>
Then he picked up a pair of forceps<br/>
Her pretty face showed fright<br/>
Right then and there, she fainted<br/>
A really grim picture is painted<br/>
The brotha who she acquainted<br/>
Was the enemy, scary ain't it?<br/>
The Pubic Enemy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Red Alert:]</i><br/>
Yeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!!!<br/>
Let me tell you more about pubic enemy<br/>
Ay, Q-Tip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Old King Cole was a merry old soul<br/>
Had a lady queen, married since 18<br/>
He protested, that he was infested<br/>
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it<br/>
All propaganda, one big fat lie<br/>
Cuz I see the king with my very own eye<br/>
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king<br/>
And poppin up on the teammates scene<br/>
And poppin and pimpin on hunnies with moneys<br/>
Whole situation to me, was kinda funny<br/>
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat<br/>
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that<br/>
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom<br/>
Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume<br/>
That he got vicked by the enemy's trick<br/>
The thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick<br/>
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin<br/>
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin<br/>
You could hear him yellin in the motherland<br/>
"Baby, baby please. Baby, understand."<br/>
She ignored and walked through the gate<br/>
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...of the enemy<br/>
The Pubic Enemy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip and Red Alert:]</i><br/>
Propmaster(yeah) Please listen to me(what?)<br/>
Something lurkin by the JimBrowski<br/>
(Who? Jenny?)<br/>
No, not propulated<br/>
A horrible creature that must be penetrated<br/>
He gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya<br/>
You better run fast, he's gonna pursue the...<br/>
(What? Yo listen here. Propmaster whiz, no one fears...)<br/>
Oh, the caves know, just thought I'd let ya know<br/>
How he lives and how he go<br/>
Watch yourself when you're out on the run<br/>
The enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun<br/>
There's four friends of mine that thought they were bad<br/>
And laid up this girl, so now, they're sad<br/>
They scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Red Alert:]</i><br/>
