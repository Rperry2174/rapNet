<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies<br/>
The highs at all of these industry shing-dings<br/>
Where you see the pretty girls<br/>
In the high animated world<br/>
Checkin' for a rapper with all the dough<br/>
If you take a shit they want to know<br/>
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all<br/>
So you still wanna do the show business?<br/>
And you think that you got what it takes?<br/>
I mean you really gotta rap and be all that<br/>
And prepare yourself for the breaks<br/>
Check it out!<br/>
<br/>
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)<br/>
The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)<br/>
Always gettin' fronted on at shows (The Business)<br/>
People gotta stick their nose (In the Business)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool<br/>
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool<br/>
Only if you're on stage or if you're speakin' to your people<br/>
Ain't no-one your equal<br/>
Especially on the industry side<br/>
Don't let the games just glide<br/>
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal<br/>
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lord Jamar]</i><br/>
<br/>
They're givin' you the business and puttin' on a show<br/>
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough<br/>
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show<br/>
Sedated and at that fact they elated<br/>
Time pass and your ass say "Where's my loot?"<br/>
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot<br/>
All you wanna do is taste the fruit<br/>
But in the back they're makin' fruit juice<br/>
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label<br/>
Not able cos you signed at the table<br/>
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance<br/>
That you didn't recoup, more soup wit' ya meal?<br/>
Cos this is the real when you get a record deal<br/>
And I say...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Aw....shucks, look what the cat hauled in<br/>
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin<br/>
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind<br/>
'bout these no-talent artists gettin' signed, they can't rhyme<br/>
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers<br/>
Goin' out like suckers, motherfuckers<br/>
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion<br/>
And if not that then I'll commence to head flyin'<br/>
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme<br/>
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?<br/>
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this<br/>
No more will I take the booty end of the stick<br/>
Bogus brothers makin' albums when they know they can't hack it<br/>
Cos they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets<br/>
Now tell me I can't tear it up<br/>
Go get yourself some toilet paper cos your lyrics is butt<br/>
<br/>
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)<br/>
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)<br/>
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)<br/>
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sadat X]</i><br/>
<br/>
The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same<br/>
You see the same faces, but at different places<br/>
When you're up and ridin' high everything is palsy-palsy<br/>
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs<br/>
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag<br/>
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag<br/>
"Oh, he's a cutie", yeah, real cute<br/>
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot<br/>
Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs<br/>
So fuck what you heard<br/>
The born cipher, cipher master makes me think much faster<br/>
But critics still continue to plaster<br/>
My name and discredit my fame<br/>
All that shit is game<br/>
And I don't really give a damn<br/>
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Diamond D]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in<br/>
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in<br/>
A matter of minutes so it must be told<br/>
All that glitters' not gold<br/>
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo<br/>
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo<br/>
My moms keeps beefin' ("Boy, get a job")<br/>
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam<br/>
Huh, well it's not that easy<br/>
You gotta get a label that's willin' and able<br/>
To market and promote, and you better hope<br/>
(For what?) That the product is dope<br/>
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbin'<br/>
When it comes to rhymin' you gotta put your time in<br/>
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile<br/>
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild.
