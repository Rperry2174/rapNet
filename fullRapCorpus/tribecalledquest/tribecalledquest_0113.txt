<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun<br/>
Bonita Applebum, go head with yourself<br/>
Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun<br/>
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on<br/>
I said Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun<br/>
Bonita Applebum, go head with yourself<br/>
Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun<br/>
Bonita, nita, nita nita, nita<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo...<br/>
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail do<br/>
I used to be all on it like a fly<br/>
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit<br/>
I flirted and I flirted till there was no end<br/>
But she kicked the diabolical and said we was friends<br/>
Hunny, you was funny, but I'm tired of that<br/>
It's three years later, I got a new rap<br/>
Got a little older, a taint bit wiser<br/>
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher<br/>
Speakin of higher, I saw you sunk a Hootie mack<br/>
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back<br/>
But I'm here to testify, it'll be a hard try<br/>
Slappin my knees, lettin out sighs<br/>
Wanna keep you bangin like a hip hop song<br/>
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: with Ron Isley singing "Oooh" in the background]</i><br/>
In the words of the immortal Swoop Daddy (uh!)<br/>
<br/>
I never shed a tear, then again I won't steer<br/>
You wrong, I steer you strong, for affections steer here<br/>
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the you know<br/>
What do you know, if we go to El Segundo<br/>
Your presence should be close, like on Buddy, I'll toast<br/>
To the ever-clever and to say the least, you're the most<br/>
Hunny, you're my hunny. A-yo dip, you're my dip<br/>
Treasure and forever, feel the pleasure with Tip<br/>
As we glide and move, cushion like a pillow that's soft and smooth<br/>
Rickety said we got to show and prove<br/>
Do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove<br/>
Intimidate the boy<br/>
Cupid, that's his name. Pickin all the suckas<br/>
It's the flippin game, but Tip don't fall for that<br/>
Instead, I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest lambskin store<br/>
Get a six pack of hats for... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
