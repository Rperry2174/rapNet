<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Uhhhhhhhh...<br/>
The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away<br/>
but not Hip-Hop yo, hahah<br/>
And let it be known.. that we are on some umm..<br/>
ehh ahh, uhh, a-chicka-uhh<br/>
ehh ahh, uhh, a-chicka-uhh<br/>
And this ain't on the pop tip yo!<br/>
Are y'all kids tucked in?  (Yeah!!)<br/>
Here we go..<br/>
<br/>
People in the audience, they cry out "hoe"<br/>
People with a gun, yo they'll cry out "bo!"<br/>
I don't like a cop, I don't sell a rock<br/>
but still the kanga's clock me, after a show<br/>
Standin on the stage and we're pourin with sweat<br/>
To people in the crowd I give what they get<br/>
Papers make paid, babies make laid<br/>
I don't really worry, nor do I fret<br/>
Waitin for the gimme and boy I got some<br/>
Sweat like a peach and tart like a plum<br/>
I thought what I think, I rock a bead-link<br/>
Legally I'll sip when I turn, twenty-one<br/>
A letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome<br/>
The R man wants me to drop my microphone<br/>
Gotta be brief; no orders from a chief<br/>
Hot butter on what, say what, the popcorn<br/>
On the tour bus we hit the truck stop<br/>
A dollar for some chips, a quarter for some pop<br/>
We laugh and giggle some, Phife kiss the honeybuns<br/>
Ali Shaheed Muhammad keeps talkin that shop<br/>
The brothers cruise on as we Quest, for the check<br/>
Callin up Famous to see, if it's there yet<br/>
Not a bourgeoise, hate the seminar<br/>
Ignorant flip, hey Miss you must jet<br/>
Flex for the funkiest but start to bounce<br/>
Measure Hip-Hop for weight, by the ounce<br/>
Bush on the tush, you're pullin while I push<br/>
Play me for the punk then puss, feel the pounce<br/>
<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
Freak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
Freak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
Freak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
Freak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)<br/>
<br/>
If the papes come yo yo I won't riff<br/>
I just sit down and get, me a spliff<br/>
With mines I was born, a child of the corn<br/>
Molecules of the land they uplift<br/>
Levels is straight, in fact they're rectified<br/>
Adrenaline now is crazy multiplied<br/>
Four and four is eight, the fraction makes the plate<br/>
I make sure the Tribe is innnnnnnn..<br/>
With the quickness you bare the witness<br/>
Flexin and pumpin with the fitness<br/>
Movin it - UHH, doin it - UHH<br/>
Those who oppose must hit the ??s-list??<br/>
Doin it and doin it with the whole frame<br/>
Look what's in the mind and not, in the brain<br/>
On this you can quote, we on a diffy note<br/>
Quest for the future, 'stead of the fame<br/>
One ninety-one brothers grabbin they thingies<br/>
Forgot the name; oh, equivalent to Jimmy<br/>
Slip a little bit, you think I have to quit<br/>
Ali Shaheed Muhammad, with the singy-singy<br/>
Slammin with a slammy you front, on the case<br/>
Right or left nut Ali, plays the ace<br/>
Do what you do, flam for a crew<br/>
Bonita Applebum blows smoke in Sha's face<br/>
Slang for the ?? I must, if ya have<br/>
Dribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh<br/>
Brothers who are snakes, I label them as fakes<br/>
Instincts to Travel up the hood path, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
Freak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
Freak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)<br/>
It's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)<br/>
Freak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)<br/>
<br/>
(Thank you..<br/>
as you all know, you just can't believe<br/>
everything you see and hear, can you??<br/>
Now if you will excuse me<br/>
I must be on my way..)
