<i>[Verse One: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
1988 Senior Year, Garvey High<br/>
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly<br/>
Loungin with the Tipster, Coolin with Sha<br/>
Scopin out the honeys - they know who they are<br/>
I was the b-ball playin fly rhyme sayin<br/>
Fly girl gettin but never was I sweatin<br/>
Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll<br/>
Until I met my match - her name was Flo<br/>
Yeah - I messed around with the one called Flo<br/>
All the troopers round the way used to call her a ho<br/>
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go<br/>
Cause I thought it was me - like Bell Biv Devoe<br/>
But little did I know that she was playin' with my mind<br/>
The only thing I learned is, good girls are hard to find<br/>
I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me<br/>
Not someone who's mind is blank and tryin' to juice me for my bank<br/>
Swingin' with my main man Lucky behind my back<br/>
What type of crap is that - yo, hows about a smack?<br/>
Word life, I can't front - thought I was all that<br/>
But now it seems, I met my match<br/>
Was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack<br/>
Settlin' down with one girl, wasn't tryin' to hear that<br/>
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen<br/>
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy<br/>
Used ta love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em<br/>
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em<br/>
My whole attitude was new day, next hon<br/>
And believe it or not, they all got done<br/>
Well here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal<br/>
And I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal<br/>
Is this really love, then again, how would I know<br/>
After all this time tryin' to be a superhoe<br/>
She finally played me, but yo, I'd find another<br/>
Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Butter, like butter baby . . . <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Not no Parkay, not no margarine,<br/>
Strickly butter baby, strictly butter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
I remember when,<br/>
Girls were goodie two shoes, but now they turned to freaks<br/>
Allofasudden "We love you Phife" - ease of ho, my name's Malik<br/>
Phife this, Phife that, where you goin', where you at<br/>
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack<br/>
You didn't want me then, so hon, don't want me now<br/>
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow<br/>
And take the Ccontact out your eye, you're far from lookin' fly<br/>
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try<br/>
Now tell me what's the reason, for dyin' your hair<br/>
Slum village gold still danglin in your ear<br/>
You barely have a neck but still sportin' a rope<br/>
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope<br/>
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do<br/>
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue<br/>
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true<br/>
And if you really loved yourself then you would try and be you<br/>
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya<br/>
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya<br/>
If you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it<br/>
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it<br/>
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it<br/>
I asked who did your hair and you tell me "Diane made it"<br/>
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe<br/>
But I can't stand, no bionic lady<br/>
Tryin' hard to look fly, but yo, you're lookin' dumber<br/>
If I wanted someone like you I woulda swung with Jamie Summers<br/>
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC<br/>
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sens-a-tiv-i-ty<br/>
See I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers<br/>
Phife Dog is on the mic and I'm smooth like Butter . . .
