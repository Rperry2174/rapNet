<i>[D-Life]</i><br/>
This is the master D-Life <br/>
as we set it off with my mans A Tribe Called Quest<br/>
And uhh, we got to do it like this baby<br/>
We got to do it like that baby<br/>
We got the good shit not the bullshit, yaknahmean?  Ha hah<br/>
We bout to count it down, we bout to count it off<br/>
It goes a-one, two, three, ahh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Malik we gettin back into that shit again<br/>
And when we rhyme, brothers need to break they pens, uh-oh<br/>
It's The Love Movement never ends<br/>
The rap game'll never be the same again<br/>
(Phife Dawg where you at baby?)  We came again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Here I come again, you feelin fine?<br/>
The Dawg is like a overflowin rhyme from mind<br/>
Usually mess with shorties whose a 8 or 9<br/>
Shorty bump around to the bass-line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
F keeps a burner on the waist-line<br/>
That cat's trickin off, I ain't wastin mine<br/>
You feel the uniqueness, you seekin this?<br/>
And when we do it, we be freakin this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Don't even front, you know you feelin this<br/>
My shade is borderin around licorice (licorice)<br/>
Enjoyin this tune, glad you playin it<br/>
(Aiyyo Phife what's the hook?)<br/>
Here we sayin it, SAYIN IT, SAYIN IT<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: with D-Life]</i><br/>
<br/>
My pad and my pen (ah ah, you didn't go there)<br/>
The beat and the blend (say word, you didn't go there)<br/>
The party won't end (you know, we got to be there)<br/>
Just keep your ?, buildin with friends, yo<br/>
<i>[repeat x2 w/ variations]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
One love, one life, and one destiny<br/>
It seems that the devil keeps testin me<br/>
Got the illest part of the recipe<br/>
Yo tell your homegirl to stop stressin me (stop it)<br/>
Undressin me is the part you really like<br/>
Brothers hold the cracks now they holdin mics<br/>
The cusses you get, ? steady rights<br/>
Marauders, we did that shit at Mid-night, a-ah-aight-aight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
I love it when my honeydip be slobbin me<br/>
Don't take it personal it's just comedy<br/>
My comedy completely turned to tragedy<br/>
I sense some of these rappers still be mad at me<br/>
Sweatin her because of her anatomy<br/>
When I bang you it'll be assault and battery<br/>
Don't make me discombobulate your micraphone<br/>
Talkin trash will only get you freakin head, flown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Uhh, buy em out the box, never faulty ones<br/>
Get in that ass like karate son<br/>
I act with the light, sometimes it's lookin grim<br/>
We manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
My Tribe be worldwide like the Nike swoosh<br/>
Emcees be soundin moist like vagina juice<br/>
The top of the world, we pursuin it<br/>
Don't worry about a thing, cause we doin it<br/>
DOIN IT, DOIN IT<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[D-Life]</i><br/>
That's the way we do.. c'mon, that's the way we do<br/>
It's the nigga D-Life, with T-C-Q<br/>
That's the way we are.. and the beat won't stop<br/>
Got to blow it up for the top.. <br/>
Didn't think you knew how we rock..
