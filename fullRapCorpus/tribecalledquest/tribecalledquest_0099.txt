Sound checking, I know your ass is shaking the room<br/>
In just a few hours you're gonna feel the burn<br/>
All of the goons are checking my guns at the door<br/>
The solid wall of sound is here on tour<br/>
It's gonna get loud<br/>
So no phones aloud<br/>
It's gonna get loud<br/>
So no phones aloud
