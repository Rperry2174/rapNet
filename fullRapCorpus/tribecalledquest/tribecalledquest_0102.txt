I said I really dream in color, but (they don't know)<br/>
And every brother ain't a brother, but (they don't know)<br/>
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)<br/>
To give her everything's my dying wish (they don't know)<br/>
Roleplay, she plays the mannequin (they don't know)<br/>
Raising my hand, teacher says "Not again" (they don't know)<br/>
The sun is up, but I feel down again (they don't know)<br/>
On just one hand, I can count all my friends (they don't know)<br/>
<br/>
The understudy for the star, the show must go on<br/>
I'm a beast on a leash, I'm towed from the lawn<br/>
Another notch in my belt, the food's getting scarce<br/>
Another notch in my belt, she shakes up the stairs<br/>
Drink liquid confidence to kill the czar defense<br/>
Get rid of this tense, it makes life make sense<br/>
'Cause I come off the fence and break through defense<br/>
Anxiety is on the ropes and it's gettin' intense<br/>
<br/>
Population gettin' tired now (they don't know)<br/>
Everybody wants to spire now (they don't know)<br/>
Racist emails fire out (they don't know)<br/>
We did it in the dark, it's coming out (they don't know)<br/>
The world is crazy and I cannot sleep, but (they don't know)<br/>
The melatonin good enough to eat, but (they don't know)<br/>
I read the papers so that I can see what (they don't know)<br/>
I rather stay indoors and make a beat, but (they don't know)<br/>
<br/>
My mother said a lotta lives were shooting<br/>
Her Bible was like her toolie<br/>
PZ-headed and unruly, I made her think she got to me<br/>
Follow in the trail of reefer and niggas talking through speakers<br/>
Fattest laces through my sneakers, and rap is for ghetto preachers<br/>
Thought I had it so I tried it, for so long I would just hide it<br/>
Then I made the crowds say "Oh," smoking more, get excited<br/>
I was hooked, I couldn't shake it, the more I got, I would take it<br/>
Couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, but this life, I would not forsake it<br/>
<br/>
I said I really dream in color, now (they don't know)<br/>
And every brother ain't a brother, now (they don't know)<br/>
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)<br/>
To give her everything's my dying wish (they don't know)<br/>
<br/>
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind<br/>
Guess I should take one, just one<br/>
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind<br/>
Guess I should take one, just one<br/>
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind<br/>
Guess I should take one, just one<br/>
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind<br/>
Guess I should take one, just one<br/>
<br/>
This one for good girls that all gone bad (just one)<br/>
This one, I'll take it when I feel sad (just one, yeah)<br/>
This one, I'll take it to make me strong (just one)<br/>
This one, I'll take it so that I'll live long (just one, yeah)<br/>
This one, I'll take it to make me smile (just one)<br/>
This one, I'll take it to make life worthwhile (just one)<br/>
This one and that one and those and these (just one)<br/>
I just want to sleep, I want to be at ease (just one)
