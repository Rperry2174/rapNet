<i>[Intro: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Do I love you?<br/>
Do I lust for you?<br/>
Am I a sinner cuz I do the two?<br/>
Could you let me know<br/>
Right now, please<br/>
Bonita Applebum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[pause between every verse]</i><br/>
Hey Bonita, glad to meet ya<br/>
For the kind of stunning newness, I must have foreseen ya<br/>
Hey, being with you is a top priority<br/>
Ain't no need to question the authority<br/>
Chairman of the board, the chief of affections<br/>
You got mine's to swing in your direction<br/>
Hey, you're like a hip hop song, you know?<br/>
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
38-24-37 (uh, uh, uh!)<br/>
You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven<br/>
I like to kiss ya where some brothas won't <br/>
I like to tell ya things some brothas don't <br/>
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes<br/>
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies<br/>
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics<br/>
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics<br/>
So far, I hope you like rap songs<br/>
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
