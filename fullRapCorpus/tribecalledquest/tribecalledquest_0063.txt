<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Live and direct, live and direct!<br/>
You know what live and direct mean?<br/>
Live and direct, come!!!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, how you be, how you be?<br/>
From New York to A-T-Aliens, youknowhatI'msayin?<br/>
Word up, do it like this<br/>
Word up word up, do it like that<br/>
And you don't stop, and you don't quit<br/>
Unless you're in the studio doin wack shit<br/>
Yo check it<br/>
<br/>
Boom batta, watch your teeth shatter<br/>
All that shit you pop in your jams, it won't matter<br/>
Bust your whole grill, now watch that joint shatter<br/>
I'm the Captain of the ship, FUCK a William Shatner<br/>
Emcees be poppin shit when they squeezin they cake batter<br/>
Claimin they style be fat, but guess whose style is fatter?<br/>
The ill beat jacker, emcee attacker<br/>
Fuckin with the Diggy it don't, get no blacker<br/>
Malik is Zach Taylor, ey the stress reliever<br/>
Brown eyed shorty, chocolate like Godiva<br/>
Fuck what you heard I'll make YOU a believer<br/>
Me gettin burnt, that's like a white girl named Shareema<br/>
You never see her, cause she's the black like Sarafina<br/>
Set shit off like Monifah, nickel like Khadija<br/>
So girls with fat asses and tits, nice to meet ya<br/>
Do five plus five equals ten?  Ask your teacher<br/>
For God so loved the world he said Phife, ask your preacher<br/>
Love to toot my own Horne, similar to Lena<br/>
Before I take stage, I take sips of Aquefina<br/>
Fucked Judy Jetson now they call me Jet Screamer<br/>
Love my coffee dark so you can keep your dairy creamer<br/>
Tribe fallin off well youse a got damn dreamer<br/>
<br/>
Hah, yaknahmean?<br/>
A word up a word up a word up a word up yo<br/>
Have you heard the one make the crowd rock?<br/>
Tribe Called Quest we haffa do it non-stop<br/>
Listen to the radio we're never goin pop cause<br/>

Say ya nah ready, say ya nah ready<br/>
Say ya nah ready for dis yet, bwoy!<br/>
Say ya nah ready, say ya nah ready<br/>

And we out like that, fuck that
