<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump <i>[6X]</i><br/>
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump-da-bump-da-bump <br/>
Bump-da-bump-da-bump<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Yo, we preparin ourselves for this ultimate war<br/>
The MCs are really lost and it's at a big cost<br/>
We be rhymin at our show thinkin we gettin dough<br/>
Movin throught every town off the fumes of...<br/>
And accolades of the crowd with our chests out proud<br/>
Yo, we  bout to pack these joints so that these...sound loud<br/>
Some kids be actin stank like a baby pant<br/>
It's the rapper Abstract that make the joint get amped<br/>
Yo, use your body maker and use your minds, to break true<br/>
Yo, we gotta do the do<br/>
Son, we livin in a time where mad folks talk (shit)<br/>
Representin they crews or they East-West clicks<br/>
Let me tell everybody from coast to coast<br/>
About the lands we boast, but we don't own jack<br/>
How the (fuck) we movin through makin moves like that?<br/>
How the (hell) we movin through makin moves like that?<br/>
Can you explain that? I doubt that, very highly<br/>
We got jewels and Mo and the life is tight rowdy<br/>
Everybody lookin (shitty) like a to' down committee<br/>
Let's make these institutions, body slam for the smitties<br/>
I got girls with plenty tails, smarts and big (titties)<br/>
And they all stressin me, yo, really?<br/>
What really goes on? (James Brown: I don't know)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
One is for the beat and the two is for the rhyme<br/>
Three is for the life, now we on this incline<br/>
Never catch this kid stickin forks in swine<br/>
Never ran my gibs in nuthin less than a dime<br/>
A few of my brothas did that asshole one time<br/>
Strivin miss sunrise, sometimes is known as crime<br/>
The three twenty-five got that Windex shine<br/>
And when I shot skelly, I had my boxes in lines<br/>
All I wanna do is live life and be fair<br/>
I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair<br/>
Now, I want a woman with a spiritual flair<br/>
God will never make it too hard for me to bare<br/>
I'm hungry like a derelict whose stays in the diluse<br/>
Some can count me out, but yo, I doubt that I lose<br/>
The Westernized world got our minds confused<br/>
You frontin on me, ak, then you don't get bruised<br/>
The funny style cats, they be playin games like Chucky<br/>
Government officials shoot their same old...<br/>
Made of devil agents a.k.a. the devil flunky<br/>
Stiff (ass) squares gettin mad cuz we funky<br/>
This the crap game, then we got the top rolls<br/>
The positive jumps the negative like frogs<br/>
Resentin evil vibes, yo, that (shit) is at the morgue<br/>
We celebrate laughin down in at the smorgas borg<br/>
You still lookin (shitty) like a to' down committee<br/>
Let's make this institution, buy the land for the smitties<br/>
I got girls with tails, plenty smarts and big (titties)<br/>
And they all stressin me...really <br/>
<br/>
