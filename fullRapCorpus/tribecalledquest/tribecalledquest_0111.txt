<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Phife Dawg, what a go on with the crew?<br/>
Nuff ting, that's why me had to come through<br/>
Phife Dawg, you spit wicked every verse<br/>
Them no say, respect the Trini man first<br/>
Phife Dawg, I know you had the man shook up<br/>
Good shit, 'cause you a mastermind that cook up<br/>
Phife Dawg, what a go on with the crew?<br/>
Nuff ting, that's why me had to come through<br/>

<i>[Phife Dawg:]</i><br/>
Phife Dawg legend, you could call me Don Juice<br/>
I'm the shit right now, what, you need to see proof?<br/>
Recently on the internet they chatting<br/>
Taking polls, debating who could win in battle rapping<br/>
Let's make it happen, these cyber flows already par<br/>
No subliminals, with me you know who the fuck you are<br/>
Who wanna spar? Haha, well, here I are<br/>
Orthodox spitter or bring on the southpaw<br/>
No doubt I'mma set it, dudes best be ready<br/>
Off top on the spot, no reading from your Whackberry<br/>
Leave the iPhones home, skill sets must be shown<br/>
I'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone, huh<br/>
I got it sewn, eh speak to all clones<br/>
Untouchable in my zone, watch it, don't leave him alone<br/>
Fuck your ass cheek flows with bars sweeter than scones<br/>
Put down microphone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Yes, yes, he the wrong ones to fuck with<br/>
No matter what the day<br/>
He could catch you on his plane or the one you on today<br/>
Visit niggas in their dreams<br/>
And make them scream of bloody murder<br/>
He's a Trini gladiator, ain't no need to take it further<br/>
If you wanna take it further your Huckleberry is here<br/>
Doctor of your holiday, Wyatt Earp ya like the tears<br/>
We gon' celebreate him, elevate him, papa had to levitate him<br/>
Give him his and don't debate him<br/>
Top dog is the way to rate him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
