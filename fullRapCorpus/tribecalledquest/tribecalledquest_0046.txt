<i>[Intro: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Just a lil somethin-somethin<br/>
about the cats who be fronting<br/>
You know the Tip, he be huntin<br/>
for all the goodness gracious<br/>
All across the wide spaces<br/>
yo, check it out, bust me down, yo<br/>
Yo... yo...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Youse my peoples, why it got to come down to this shit<br/>
Two people thinking as one so now he split<br/>
Remember what I said to you, you bleed, I bleed<br/>
C'mon, you know how we get down, if you're down, you need<br/>
And I'm supplying, the dynamic duo, electricfying<br/>
Everybody had to wet us, cuz no one will forget us<br/>
Son, I testify sure as God was my guide<br/>
Any petty little bullshit you did will slide<br/>
Same on my end, after all, what are we, friends<br/>
If niggaz ran me this, too much grounds we defend<br/>
In the honor or brotherhood cuz it's all good<br/>
Get on some grown man shit and let's knock on wood<br/>
But now seeing you baby in this stall out position<br/>
Wondering who's the dime piece that you're kissing<br/>
You night as well take the jigger and take my life<br/>
Cuz the dime piece you happen to be kissing is my wife<br/>
Shit, I should have know not to let these crab asses<br/>
Get within the circle of my girl and make passes<br/>
Now you disrespected me and everything I stand for<br/>
(But I'm saying though, son) Shhh, say no more<br/>
Allah forgive me, my thoughts is traveling to low desires<br/>
Should I turn the other cheek or react and perspire<br/>
Don't wanna see myself in penitentiary attire<br/>
But I caught him in the act and my emotion is dire
