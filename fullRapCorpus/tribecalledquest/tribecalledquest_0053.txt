<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
<br/>
Sometimes men and women look at themselves and see bliss<br/>
Through experience we tend to exist<br/>
That's through our past or our caretakers<br/>
The instance is in particular, so you need to recognize that<br/>
if you take all this away<br/>
and look at us at the end of the day<br/>
we stand great among creation<br/>
So baby take these words as a little inspiration<br/>
While I kick this shit get your ass motivation<br/>
MCs, you're walking a thin line<br/>
Get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines<br/>
and plus vipers, phony rhymers and biters<br/>
Money-grubbers, beat-dubbers<br/>
amongst a whole host of others<br/>
Who be fakin', fraudulatin'<br/>
Waitin' for your bacon<br/>
They be takin' and skatin' while you sit contemplatin'<br/>
Who's your peoples<br/>
Well let me tell you somethin' now paw<br/>
We're livin' a world that's R-A-double-raw<br/>
It's crazy but it's true, go for delly is the law<br/>
and if you cross the path then you dangerin' your jaw<br/>
And if you Glass Joe, don't go toe-for-toe<br/>
Yo all we wanna do is our thing and lay low<br/>
So brothers hold your heads high when you get down<br/>
Don't violate these women cuz we need them around<br/>
It's all of us together, not the one without the other<br/>
The Abstract is ill, word to mother.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
We got to do our do, not separate, together<br/>
Got to move on through, not separate, together<br/>
Got to do our do, not separate, together<br/>
Got to move on through, not separate, together<br/>
<br/>
Yo, we got some problems baby<br/>
People stressed out, check it<br/>
But we can make it Sugar<br/>
Keep it light and I say<br/>
move on through separate<br/>
not together but together<br/>
Not separate, that's how<br/>
we got to do it, check it on out<br/>
Bust it, yo...<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
