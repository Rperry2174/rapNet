<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Phiiiiiife Dawg<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i> Yo Kamal<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Reggie Noble<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i> Up in ya!<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Yo Busta Bus, yo it's time to step up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
You know I plas-ter, the little bas-tard<br/>
and mastered the real way you slap the bitchest niggaz backwards<br/>
Hah!  Uh-oh, aiyyo, whenever Busta Rhymes say so (mmmhmm)<br/>
when we move yes (mmmhmm) sometimes we lay low (mmmhmm) aiyyo (yo)<br/>
Big up my little nigga Pedro<br/>
Make you after the L like turkey, cheese and to-ma-to (to)<br/>
Fuck is that?  Especially for niggaz that will pay no<br/>
attention to instructions, like they still wan' disobey y'all<br/>
Wonderin how it's activate real quick?<br/>
But then I could grow about five feet more with an extra dick!<br/>
One dick to hold in my hand when I'm rockin the mic<br/>
The extra dick to blow up the pussy for the rest of the night<br/>
Then I return with more lyrics like a bunch of rough niggaz<br/>
They tough niggaz that snuff niggaz (hah)<br/>
I know the club got enough niggaz (huh!)<br/>
to slap your face, expert, who the next jerk, to make me<br/>
exert heat?  FUKKIT, let me network! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i> Ha-hah!<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Yo Reggie Noble<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i> Feel me, yo Busta Bus<br/>
<i>[Busta]</i> What up?<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Yo Phife Dawg, yo it's time to step up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
Yo what the fuck, ungh!<br/>
Check it here, peep the four-man transaction (action)<br/>
Phife diggy Dawg, we on some Todd Shaw mackin (mackin)<br/>
You know my stee', there's no time for relaxin (relaxin)<br/>
Word to Reggie (Phife Dawg) yo it's _Time 4 Sum Aksion_<br/>
Girl swing yo' ass, I can feel you climaxin (climaxin)<br/>
Don't even front, you know you wanna make it happen (make it happen!)<br/>
Yo Busta Bus, do you hear Violator faxin?  (mad faxin)<br/>
Eighty G's for one show (eighty G's yo) that's satisfaction (satisfaction)<br/>
Now which emcee feel like he fuckin with dis heah?  (This here)<br/>
Word to Queens, I keep shit hot like a canish, yeah  (Nish yeah!)<br/>
Malik is back, I'm here to make you look foolish (foolish)<br/>
My roughest niggaz in the Apple (Apple) on Coolidge (Coolidge)<br/>
Remember White Shadow?  My click stay sharper than an arrow (c'mon)<br/>
Plus in Trinidad I'm treated like the mighty sparrow (uh-huh)<br/>
Freestylin son, like there was no tommorrow (fuck it up nigga fuck it up)<br/>
Hence the reason why your bitch ass would love to follow (what?)<br/>
Two different toasters in your chest will make your shit hollow<br/>
How's about them apples, oh is it too hard to swallow?<br/>
Push your wig back, word to Big Moot and Bolo<br/>
Billy Razor, Fudge Lover, on down to Shine Lightro (Love Movement)<br/>
Yo Bootsy takes this mic from this fool see, make him run it<br/>
Five-foot invasion son, you can't run from it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta]</i> Yo Reggie Noble<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i> Blaoowww, yo Phife diggy!<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i> What up?<br/>
<i>[Busta]</i> Yo yo Kamal it's your time to step up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Check it out, the original, shit, we makin it<br/>
Takin it, to the extremes, we breakin it<br/>
When we get, inside a zone then you feel that it's good<br/>
All you jelly cats stop marinatin my wood<br/>
Niggazm grab the mic with loads of malarky<br/>
I bring the knowledge and wield the anarchy<br/>
Put it on pooh-butts who's unsettled with ignorance<br/>
Give the last sentence with poignance and diligence<br/>
Eighteen wheelin through niggaz like truckers<br/>
Breakin ankles, put it on like we at the ruckus<br/>
Guaranteein that shorty can move it around<br/>
In the place that gets you hot but leaves you here on the ground<br/>
Contenders don't you even think to challenge the crown<br/>
Of these brothers who so elequently hold the beat down<br/>
Fuck the rigamarole, we vyin for the control<br/>
We the musical equation of the whole entire nation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Yo Phife Dawg<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i> Yes Kamal<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Busta Bus<br/>
<i>[Busta]</i> What up?<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Yo Reggie Noble yo it's time to step up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
Yo yo<br/>
I'm just a ill nigga who don't got it all up stairs<br/>
Riding dick, get the balls til they come in pairs<br/>
Oh yeah, throw the goggles on these engineers<br/>
Cause it might, get kinda wet when I spit this here<br/>
Yo, I'm six-foot-one with a big ass gun<br/>
To carry it you'd need a waistline the size of Big Pun<br/>
But I move crowds without a gun <br/>
like if -- The New York State Lottery is ninety nine million!!<br/>
Hah-hah, yo, when it's time to flow I suprise and blow<br/>
five hundred thousand units off a dime a trow<br/>
Forty below, I'm thorough when it's time to throw<br/>
the caboose, I'm even hard to be touched by a masousse<br/>
Whoo-whoo!  Funk Doc gets the money<br/>
and best believe I went through more trees than Sonny<br/>
Me, Kamal, Busta Bus, Phife Dawg<br/>
Shittin, pussy niggaz get Lysol!<br/>
Heh heh heh
