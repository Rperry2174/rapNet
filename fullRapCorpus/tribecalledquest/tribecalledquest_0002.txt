<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
After Hours it was cool <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse<br/>
Downtown late of three of course<br/>
Just came from fishing couldn't get a catch<br/>
Downtown they'll probably have a batch<br/>
A whitened sandwich and a Guiness stout<br/>
But with the bail though I had a bout<br/>
So I exchanged it for some apple juice<br/>
I had the blues but I shook them loose<br/>
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets<br/>
Loots of funk over hardcore beats<br/>
The moon dabbles in the morning sky<br/>
As the minutes just creep on by<br/>
I get a thought and hear comes my Tribe<br/>
Ritual shakes and in good vibes<br/>
Like always the Quest begins<br/>
In the mist though but the rhyth's move in<br/>
We find a spot and we sit and chat<br/>
Speaking on the status quo of rap<br/>
A derelick makes a real long speach<br/>
We pay attention to the words he read<br/>
When he was done we rattled on<br/>
There was no lunch because it wasn't dawn<br/>
We pointed things out about this times<br/>
The worlds famons and the crazy crimes<br/>
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me<br/>
I better go gold, to pay the taxes<br/>
Gotta be swift society<br/>
The man whose made is the man who maxes<br/>
The grounds for living are being discussed<br/>
As we go it gets close to dusk<br/>
Gather thoughts and savor breath<br/>
Cause there's only a few hours left<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
After Hours it was cool <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Me ohh my, hey-hey, hey-hey<br/>
The human hours are here to stay<br/>
This is how it seems <i>[?]</i> my witness<br/>
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this<br/>
Girls be screaming on this conversation<br/>
I have my two cents for a revelation<br/>
And my watch continuously tic-tocs<br/>
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks<br/>
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles<br/>
A car revs up and I hear it trottle<br/>
It probably moves with the morning wind<br/>
Ohh my God, here's Phife again<br/>
<i>[?]</i> talking about last nights game<br/>
Trying to remember someone's name<br/>
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets<br/>
Once again Ali will bring up the beat<br/>
Like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sounds of frogs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
The beat is over and so is the night<br/>
The sun is risen and the shine is bright<br/>
We all say peace and go our separate ways<br/>
Youth is fading as we gain our days<br/>
Expedition for the song is simp'<br/>
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp<br/>
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh<br/>
As we start up our rhythmic path<br/>
Like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
