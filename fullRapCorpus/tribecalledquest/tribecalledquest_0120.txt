Check my style out<br/>
Life situations are the one I speak about<br/>
It seems cats now-a-days we gettin' introduced to courage<br/>
Don't get discouraged 'cause my words will threw her like flourish<br/>
we got the bounty<br/>
we from the queen's county<br/>
overlookin' things like a Rushmore Mounty<br/>
And got no other choice except to get a little love<br/>
We rise above<br/>
We be fittin' like a glove<br/>
Thr pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy<br/>
We have no other boy but to bring the B-boy<br/>
There's nothin' on this erb that can end still fear<br/>
The locomive, puttin' my thing in gear<br/>
I only have the fear of God and that's taqwa<br/>
You need binaca<br/>
Your trap is blazing like blanca<br/>
I got the lethal you couldn't put a match to it<br/>
Let me know yo we could do it like Stu it<br/>
Mind over matter action is needed<br/>
When the big one not to be super seeded<br/>
Responsibility is somethin' I can't deny<br/>
The illegallies is Narcist reply<br/>
Most cats scrambled to do 'cause they want to<br/>
But on the kick rising in the past on in prompt to<br/>
My lily's hot like two links in the skillet<br/>
A room filled with speakers one stage, watch me kill it<br/>
Now we should resort from the cradle to the grave<br/>
Round and opposition twisted like Super Dave<br/>
You be looking, Bub, just like Uncle Jesse<br/>
Don't make the scene messy<br/>
'Cause it'll jump that's word Aunt Betsy<br/>
Profound sentences to pure lyric dems<br/>
Some of my friends be like a people with stems<br/>
Folks be on the chase for this cheddar<br/>
Thinkin' it makes your life better<br/>
But it can make you ass out<br/>
And when I'm at a show chicks never pass out<br/>
We got the noise to make the whole mash out<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest make the party go down<br/>
Plus we make posite divots to fill up all your crowns<br/>
Lyrics come to cats like a hot and cold flash<br/>
So can come with ease if four and a smash<br/>
Held the fort down like the Justice League all the super friends<br/>
But in the world turn more spins<br/>
Brothers walk the street with the ill pace face<br/>
City life breeze contempt for each race<br/>
all praises due to Allah and I should say it<br/>
It' the abstract, motor, vader, making things, making things better<br/>
Puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll<br/>
'Cause you know this kid is got wild soul<br/>
Of every kind of drama<br/>
Like stars out pirhanna<br/>
Cold like ice jazzed hot like a sauna<br/>
It's the has verse the the half guess who's arrived in the hood<br/>
Exposing all wrongs it's all good<br/>
Yo word up, hip-hop is live like a wire<br/>
Let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire<br/>
I got to stress it again<br/>
You see it's for my Ken<br/>
And all my babies<br/>
Children of the world, no maybe's<br/>
To you we got to move through<br/>
And push through<br/>
Because we got to make it happen keep the true blue<br/>
<br/>
It's like that<br/>
So much confusion goin' on<br/>
So much confusion goin' on<br/>
Inside all mine<br/>
Inside all mine<br/>
So much confusion goin' on<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, uh<br/>
But everything will be fine<br/>
So much confusion goin' on<br/>
So much confusion goin' on<br/>
Gotta make it alright<br/>
Gotta make it alright<br/>
Gotta elevate your mind<br/>
Elevate your mind<br/>
Elevate your mind<br/>
Elevate your mind<br/>
Elevate your mind<br/>
Elevate your mind<br/>
Elevate your min
