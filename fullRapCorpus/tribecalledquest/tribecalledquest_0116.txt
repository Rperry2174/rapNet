<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
African American with the power, just tapped in to the cultural gin<br/>
That be swallowin our minds, whole, but yo must it<br/>
Empty ass rappers get me fueled and disgusted<br/>
Can't even kick a rhyme about yourself properly<br/>
Listen man I'll show you why you ain't toppin me<br/>
Epitome of levelheadedness<br/>
Whose concern is how I'll I come off and how that I'll that I dress<br/>
I don't, hit you with a whole bunch of bullshit<br/>
On the microphone I keep my pros fluid<br/>
Speakin to the people in a Tongue that's Native<br/>
Not with an ego that's anti-creative<br/>
Conscious to the fact that I'm a talented lad<br/>
Make your move at a jam and feel better when sad<br/>
Hey, "Assalamu Alaikum" to them firm true believers<br/>
Hope y'all pretty good as the message receiver<br/>
Cause yo we got to take things in-to our own hands<br/>
And be aware of these dangerous, plentiful lands<br/>
That we exist within and combat and shake on<br/>
But do it over Tribe because Tribe is the bomb<br/>
We get through, especially if you got my back<br/>
The Abstract, machete cuttin down all slack<br/>
And we do it like this, rarely do we miss<br/>
Catch you in the chest with an eagle claw fist<br/>
And back you, get it two by four and she'll lack you<br/>
Tip you only find a nigga now that out raps you<br/>
Or gets at you, and insists that you do it<br/>
Cause you make it smooth and you make it like fluid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Q-Tip (Rah Digga)]</i><br/>
Sometimes I just be wonderin<br/>
How these cats be com-in IN<br/>
<br/>
I think we need to rectify this right?<br/>
(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rah Digga:]</i><br/>
The name's Digga and I'm on, a mission to be larger<br/>
Than them crackers that be running Time Warner (That's-right)<br/>
I take it further, even runnin' shit in Persia<br/>
With acquisitions and merges<br/>
"You takin' me? " I might have you stressin<br/>
"Your rap styles clear, " but I'm the only danger pressin<br/>
Rah lyrics with "UMMAH" productions<br/>
Be "phatter" than a chick that had liposuction<br/>
They wasn't ready, for that which came<br/>
T'was a slim little hunny after the fat bitch sang<br/>
I break it down like quadratic equations<br/>
You luke warm, my shit hotter than cajuns<br/>
{Blazin} Stop, you ain't even worth my while<br/>
Mama boy tryna play it like he motherless child<br/>
The whole rap industry is another evil<br/>
They play enough times then I just might believe you<br/>
Heads was still rhymin glock with clock<br/>
I was puttin shit together phatter than ten Shirley Murdocks<br/>
Ain't nuthin but a buncha, thorns in my side like you was acupuncture<br/>
Bust it, playin post with me? that's unruly<br/>
No matter how bougie you'll still be a mooley<br/>
It's Rah Digga from the O-U-T's<br/>
Having bullshit rappers going "Whoa it's" me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
We demonstrate MC and their music<br/>
Laced with the real P-funk you must choose it<br/>
We Buck Rogers, ayo we sun you like Twiggie<br/>
Girls be like (he's jiggy), and they friends be like (who is he?)<br/>
Mastering the mic like Jordan with the pill<br/>
Showing a nigga love cause a nigga got skills<br/>
A little sumthin sumthin, corny cats must flee<br/>
Rah Digga forms the lines with the Ab' MC<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rah Digga:]</i><br/>
Ahhhhh...<br/>
Peace Tip, the love flows abundant<br/>
To Pace One, the underdopeless and youngin<br/>
Rappers be off on a tangent<br/>
I could flow longer than the van with<br/>
Backwards stan smith<br/>
When I go bring the noise<br/>
I sweep rappers by the "Bunch" like they Brady's boys<br/>
So change your sound 'fore I claim that crown<br/>
That's for all y'all home girls on dangerous grounds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4: Q-Tip (Rah Digga)]</i><br/>
Sometimes I just be wonderin<br/>
How these cats be com-in IN<br/>
<br/>
I think we need to rectify this right?<br/>
(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah Native Tongue's in the house (Mmm, hmm)<br/>
Yeah yeah Outsider's in the house (Outsiders in the hosue)<br/>
Yeah the UMMAH's in the hosue (UMMAH's in the house)<br/>
Big Tribe in the house
