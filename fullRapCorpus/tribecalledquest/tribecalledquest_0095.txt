Uh, check it out now<br/>
Uh, no doubt now<br/>
Uh, yo, check it out now<br/>
Uh, no doubt, yo<br/>
<br/>
Special girl, real good girl<br/>
Biggest thing in my itty bitty world<br/>
Called her up and she made me feel right<br/>
Wish the bliss could never take flight<br/>
Sittin back with this mic in my hand<br/>
Spittin hot shit tryin to see grand<br/>
Imprinted on my mind every minute<br/>
Make my plans and you always in it, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You're such a vivrant thing,<br/>
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing<br/>
<br/>
And even though we both fly<br/>
Give each other space and not the evil eye<br/>
Actin like grownups<br/>
Don't even try to hide cause the spot blown up<br/>
Girlfriend tellin you she wanna see<br/>
I say 'I dunno' but you say 'Gladly'<br/>
And when we both do hemp<br/>
We go on and on and on and on and on and<br/>
Sweeter than Ben &amp; Jerry<br/>
Can I rhyme?  Well you know I gets mine<br/>
Sittin round in my abstract part<br/>
This abstract thing goin abstract far, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Gettin back to my MC status<br/>
All the willy that I kick make the other niggaz maddest<br/>
Movin, to your town and situation<br/>
Shorty thought she subtle but she really was blatant when she<br/>
shook her thing and violated<br/>
Now these wolf-like thoughts are formulated<br/>
I'm sayin, "Yo is this some heartfelt shit here?<br/>
Am I strong-backed nigga?  Well shit yeah"<br/>
Plus we can hold a convo'<br/>
or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo<br/>
Just wanna see you by my side<br/>
We on 95, know the stash is in the ride<br/>
A rappin nigga for real<br/>
You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal<br/>
Rap slate like big grate<br/>
You buy, I sell, we split big cake<br/>
Uh uh, just move your little thing<br/>
Move it around and shake your little thing<br/>
Uh uhh yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i>
