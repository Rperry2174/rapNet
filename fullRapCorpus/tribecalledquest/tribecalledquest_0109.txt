<i>[Phife Dawg:]</i><br/>
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio<br/>
Just done mash a show, Dawg is off on sabbatical<br/>
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic<br/>
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery<br/>
Trump and the SNL hilarity<br/>
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy<br/>
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing<br/>
As if this country ain't already ruined<br/>
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling<br/>
Swearing they're the greatest<br/>
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters<br/>
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food<br/>
The nucleus is here now (ooo)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin<br/>
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in<br/>
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men<br/>
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation<br/>
Reverends and cattles racing<br/>
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy<br/>
Fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams<br/>
And manifest all insanity, look around<br/>
Sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground<br/>
<br/>

(Sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground)<br/>
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio<br/>
(Sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground)<br/>
Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio<br/>

Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio<br/>
