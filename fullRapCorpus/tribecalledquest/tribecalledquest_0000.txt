<i>[Verse 1: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Q-Tip is my title.<br/>
I don't think that is vital for me to be your idol,<br/>
But dig this recital.<br/>
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissin',<br/>
Slingin' this and that, 'cause this and that was missin'.<br/>
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected.<br/>
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected.<br/>
Afrocentric livin', Africans be givin'<br/>
A lot to the cause 'cause the cause has been risen.<br/>
Some brothers, they be flammin', thinkin' we ain't slammin,<br/>
Comin' off like the days where we used to wear the tans and<br/>
A blue-colllar talker, a hemisphere stalker,<br/>
A glass of O.J and a ten mile walk-a.<br/>
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearin',<br/>
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheerin'?<br/>
I am what I am, that's a tribal man.<br/>
We all know the colours, we all must stand.<br/>
As we start our travels, things they will unravel.<br/>
"Que sera sera", for this unit is like gravel.<br/>
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song.<br/>
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Push it along, push it along.<br/>
Push it along, yeah, push it along. <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Pfeife, Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Put one up for the Pfeife, it's time to deceipher.<br/>
The ills of the world make the situation lighter.<br/>
The clock is always tickin', the systems should be kickin'.<br/>
Like <i>[?]</i> ham and eggs, I eat chicken, chicken, chicken.<br/>
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever,<br/>
Embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour?<br/>
The wraughts of the rap filling up the gap<br/>
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap.<br/>
<br/>
The boom, the bip, the boom bip<br/>
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip.<br/>
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles<br/>
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble.<br/>
It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty,<br/>
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty.<br/>
This ain't trial and error, more like tribe and error,<br/>
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror.<br/>
The street can't depart from the bloody heart.<br/>
Repair the wear and tear, don't start 'fore it starts.<br/>
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song.<br/>
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Marchin' off the project, we hope that you will subject.<br/>
It's good to be an object and never, ever reject.<br/>
The tribe who meanders with drunken propoganda,<br/>
Keep it in boom and never will we slander.<br/>
<i>[?]</i> should be handed, don't let me demand it.<br/>
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit.<br/>
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it.<br/>
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it.<br/>
Although she's flippin' crazy, give my love to Gracy.<br/>
God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?<br/>
The pigs are wearin' blue, and in a year or two,<br/>
We'll be goin' up the creek in a great big canoe.<br/>
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?<br/>
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers.<br/>
Never will we do that and we ain't tryin' to rule that.<br/>
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?<br/>
This society of fake reality<br/>
Are nothin' but a peg of informality.<br/>
While I sing my song, sing it all day long,<br/>
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
