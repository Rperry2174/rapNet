<i>[Q-tip:]</i><br/>
Listen up everybody the bottom line<br/>
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined<br/>
with precision like a bullet, target bound<br/>
just livin like a hooker, the harlett sounds<br/>
now when I say the harlett, you know I mean the hott<br/>
V-A-V-A-Vader, the brothers in the spot<br/>
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hit<br/>
Captain of the poets, I'm the #7 pick<br/>
lick, lick, lick boy on your backside<br/>
lick, lick, lick boy on your backside<br/>
listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide<br/>
Tip the earthly body<br/>
heavens on my side<br/>
even in Santo Domingo<br/>
Can I gotta Gringo<br/>
we got mikes when do we go<br/>
know a little nigga who can ryhme when you ask me<br/>
short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy<br/>
Phife Dawg<br/>
1 for the treble<br/>
2 for the bass<br/>
you know the style Tip<br/>
it's time to flip this<br/>
I like my beats hard like two day old shit<br/>
steady eatin booty M.C's like cheese Grits<br/>
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode<br/>
used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue<br/>
it's not like honey dip would wanna get with me<br/>
but just in case I own more condoms then T.L.C.<br/>
now the formula is this Me, Tip, and Ali<br/>
for those who can't count it goes 1-2-3<br/>
The answer(scratch-Damn right I'm)Hiccup is how i be<br/>
brothers find it's hard to do but never me<br/>
some brothers try to dis my malik<br/>
you see'm ditchin me<br/>
now cure all the B.B. M.C.'s my shit is hittin<br/>
trainin gladiator, anti-hesitater<br/>
Shaheed push the fader from here to Granada<br/>
Mr. energetic, who me sound pathetic<br/>
when's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?<br/>
(I don't know man<i>[3x]</i>)<br/>
(I don't know<i>[2x]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Oh My God yes, Oh my god <i>[x10]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Complimentary it be<br/>
the theif of Poetry<br/>
I got a humdinger comin hook line and sinker<br/>
the TIMBO hits with the prints underground<br/>
TIMBO's on the toes, i like the way it's goin down<br/>
down like the lady of the evenin        <br/>
when it goes in Toots just beleive the sin<br/>
cuz Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place<br/>
Take off your boots cuz you can't run the race<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Oh My God <i>[x14]</i>)
