<i>[Intro/Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
We got the jazz <i>[X4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue<br/>
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21<br/>
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound<br/>
Captivate the mass, cause the prose is profound<br/>
<br/>
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek<br/>
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep<br/>
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz<br/>
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends<br/>
<br/>
So push it, along, trails, we blaze<br/>
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise<br/>
The tranquility will make ya unball your fist<br/>
For we put hip-hop on a brand new twist<br/>
<br/>
A brand new twist with the homie-alistic<br/>
So low-key that ya probably missed it<br/>
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd<br/>
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed<br/>
<br/>
So raise up squire, address your attire<br/>
We have no time to wallow in the mire<br/>
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead<br/>
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed<br/>
<br/>
Then cool out to the music cuz it makes ya feel serene<br/>
Like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things<br/>
Like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work<br/>
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk<br/>
<br/>
I don't really mind if it's over your head<br/>
Cuz the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead<br/>
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher<br/>
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Competition, dem Phifer come sideway<br/>
But competition, dey mus' me come straightway<br/>
Competition, dem Phifer come sideway<br/>
But competition, dey mus' come straightway<br/>
<br/>
Hows about that, it seems like it's my turn again<br/>
All through the years my mike has been my best friend<br/>
I know some brothers wonder, can Phifer really kick it?<br/>
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?<br/>
<br/>
I'm all into my music cuz it's how I make papes<br/>
Tryin' to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes<br/>
Me sweat another?  I do my own thing<br/>
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing<br/>
<br/>
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks<br/>
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks<br/>
I sing, and chat, I do all of that<br/>
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack<br/>
<br/>
I take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock<br/>
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop<br/>
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear<br/>
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare<br/>
<br/>
So jet to the store, and buy the LP<br/>
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's<br/>
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew<br/>
And oh shit, Skiff Anselm, he gets props too<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you have a system with some phat house speakers<br/>
So the new shit can rock, from Mars to Massapequa<br/>
Cuz where I come from quality is job one<br/>
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done<br/>
<br/>
So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew<br/>
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up<br/>
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut<br/>
<br/>
Back and forth just like a Cameo song<br/>
If you dig this joint then please come dance along<br/>
To the music cuz it's done just for the rhyme<br/>
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline<br/>
<br/>
The jazz, the what?  The jazz can move that ass<br/>
Cuz the Tribe originates that feelin' of pizzazz<br/>
It's the universal sound, best to brothers underground<br/>
In the one-six below, ya didn't have to go<br/>
<br/>
Some say that I'm a sinner cuz I once had an orgy<br/>
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies<br/>
If this is a stinker, then call me a stink, I ask<br/>
"What? What? What?" - now check it out<br/>
<br/>
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop<br/>
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop<br/>
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop<br/>
That includes the Bronx a' Harlem ya don't stop<br/>
<br/>
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop<br/>
I say because Ladies First ya don't stop<br/>
And to the JB's, ya don't stop<br/>
And De La Soul, ya don't stop<br/>
<br/>
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop<br/>
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop<br/>
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop<br/>
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop<br/>
<br/>
Everybody in the place ya don't stop<br/>
Ya keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop<br/>
And last but not least on the sure shot<br/>
It's the Zulu nation
