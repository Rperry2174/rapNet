<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Your new lesson is to realize the mission when you hear it<br/>
MCin, see I got this in my spirit<br/>
I got verses like Mahalia singin church hymns<br/>
So strap up because you skatin on ice that's wild thin<br/>
A weak foundation doesn't make a good home<br/>
That's why mine is built on chrome microphones<br/>
We bout to do it theoretically, insteadibly, to the medley<br/>
Come on<br/>
It's the complete Kamal, unique, Fareed, breed<br/>
That'll keep you broke down like a horse 5 speed<br/>
So move buddy, a yo we got to get this money<br/>
In this land of dead and crummy, ain't a damn thing funny<br/>
A yo, shout out to Mobb Deep, the Extra P<br/>
Busta Rhymes, De La, the J Beez, so don't sleep<br/>
We got reality for the carriage<br/>
Stayin sincere to this, so I know we gonna manage<br/>
Give me, liberty in mass amounts and Swiss bank accounts<br/>
With the sustainer, it'll be real<br/>
So me and my brothas, we can sit down and build<br/>
Like Rampage with that last boy scout appeal<br/>
We got that silk, satin, Manhattan intelligence feel<br/>
That keeps everything on even keels<br/>
So all you slow brothas talkin yang, ya poo tang<br/>
Now, we gonna show you how the real crew bang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
A yo, I bring it to you live kid, Queens niggaz love static<br/>
Your rap's had it, braggin more numbers than mathematics<br/>
I get brains on progmatic from leavin wet dreams shattered<br/>
That's the same copy gettin in your mug shot<br/>
I stays hot like summertime on LBQ and boo boo<br/>
The love shack is 192, my joint's smooth<br/>
To watch them niggaz fall like Linque<br/>
I keeps it brand new like school shoppin<br/>
It's on and poppin<br/>
So come peep this nigga's steez like rayon<br/>
You get laid off while I'll be gamin ghetto girl like 8-Off<br/>
The verdict's in, I be the look of blendin<br/>
Give up your goods cause it's the start of your endin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
(Where ya at?) We seein life for what it is<br/>
(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids<br/>
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation<br/>
(Where ya at?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Now, all that glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail<br/>
It's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail<br/>
I keeps it realer than the logo on milk<br/>
Denouncin tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk<br/>
That's the sound of the man gettin yanked off the stage<br/>
Tryin to front like he mad paid<br/>
Suckin so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)<br/>
MCs are just givin it all away (OK)<br/>
Who said him know about the Quest type sound?<br/>
Mess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)<br/>
I dedicate this to the posers that play hard<br/>
You wanna hear some rhymes, well come bring your bodyguard<br/>
So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display<br/>
Leavin all MCs in complete disarray<br/>
I beez a veteran MC, crushin crews for years<br/>
You frontin hard, when you softer than the Berenstain Bears<br/>
Yeah, chumps be like "Phife, that ain't fair"<br/>
Fuck outta here, do I look like I care<br/>
Come off my stage, before I grab ya neck and handle ya<br/>
Wet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada<br/>
Shaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer<br/>
Peace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers<br/>
I'm cappin hard cause I got this rap shit sold<br/>
From Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road<br/>
You know my steez, I treat hip hop like a sport<br/>
Holdin down fort up on Martinique Court like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
(Where ya at?) We seein life for what it is<br/>
(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids<br/>
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation<br/>
(Where ya at?) We gonna start the Zulu Nation<br/>
(Where ya at?) Come on, come on<br/>
(Where ya at?) We gonna put it all together<br/>
(Where ya at?) No matter what the hell the weather<br/>
(Where ya at?)<br/>
<br/>
Uh, uh, mind power <i>[x5]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, kickin willie is good, all throughout your whole hood<br/>
But we gotta start with the spirit first y'all<br/>
Mind power
