<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
Dundali, Dundalow, Dundli Dundalee<br/>
You know I look for trouble but trouble didn't follow me<br/>
All I wanted to be was an iller MC<br/>
Ever since nigga small as I grew up in Queens<br/>
What did you mosh of the Nontall (Holla Me!)<br/>
I turned my best friend Quaturem em head what I'd seen<br/>
And ever since that day (y'll hear me) things been a mess<br/>
R&amp;B goes to rocky, true I tell and bless<br/>
So nowadays I go and see wifey just to kill me from stress<br/>
Lay my head on her breast, sugar definitely knows best<br/>
Explaining all my problems to her, gettin things off my chest<br/>
A lil hug up squeez up and no more I vent<br/>
Aiyo Sunny, without my peeps I'd be truely assed out<br/>
Making sure I have my lettercations so I wouldn't pass out<br/>
Native Tongues for believing in me when everyone was fessing<br/>
Most of Ja Mighty for the guidance and the blessings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Faith Evans]</i><br/>
<br/>
I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out<br/>
When you're face to face with your adversity<br/>
I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out<br/>
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually<br/>
<i>[32 seconds between]</i><br/>
<br/>
I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out<br/>
When you're face to face with your adversity<br/>
I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out<br/>
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually<br/>
Come on baby we gonna make it<br/>
