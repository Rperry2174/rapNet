<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Yo, microphone check one two what is this<br/>
The five foot assassin with the ruffneck business<br/>
I float like gravity, never had a cavity<br/>
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family<br/>
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame<br/>
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same<br/>
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have<br/>
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half<br/>
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path<br/>
Messin round with this you catch ?the sizin of em?<br/>
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper<br/>
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper<br/>
Refuse to com-pete with BS competition<br/>
Your name ain't Special Ed so won't you Seckle With the Mission<br/>
I never walk the streets, think it's all about me<br/>
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be<br/>
I just try my best to like go all out<br/>
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Uhhh, uhhh, uhhh, uh!<br/>
Zulu Nation, brothers that's creation<br/>
Minds get flooded, ejaculation<br/>
right on the two inch tape<br/>
The Abstract poet incognito, runsss the cape<br/>
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my<br/>
point across, so bust, the floss<br/>
As I go in betweeen, the grit and the dirt<br/>
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm<br/>
as I crack the, monotone<br/>
Children of the jazz so, get your own<br/>
Smokin R&amp;B cause they try to do me<br/>
or the best of the pack but they can't do rap<br/>
For it's Abstract, orig-inal<br/>
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful<br/>
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug<br/>
on R&amp;B, but I can't and that's bugged<br/>
<br/>
Buggin out, buggin out, buggin out you're buggin out <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Yo when you bug out, you usually have a reason for the action<br/>
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction<br/>
People be houndin, always surroundin<br/>
Pulsin, just like a migraine poundin<br/>
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense<br/>
?Comafied? your feeling, of absolute tense<br/>
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind<br/>
But people seem to take that, as being unkind<br/>
"Oh yo he's acting stank," really on a regal?<br/>
A man of the fame not a man of the people<br/>
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much<br/>
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks<br/>
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's<br/>
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please<br/>
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug<br/>
if you do the result, will end up kind of bugged<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Yo, I am not an invalid although I used to smoke the weed out<br/>
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out<br/>
Schemin on the cookies with the crazy boomin back buns<br/>
Pushin on the real ?hardest? so we can have the big fun<br/>
When I left for Rosie I was Boulevard status<br/>
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his baddest<br/>
It was one MC after one MC<br/>
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me<br/>
Do I have the formula to save the world?<br/>
Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls<br/>
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid<br/>
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did<br/>
Supposed to be my man but now I wonder cause you're feeble<br/>
I go out with the strongest and I seperate the evils<br/>
it's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out<br/>
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out<br/>
<br/>
Buggin out, buggin out, buggin out you're buggin out <i>[x8]</i>
