<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
We be the number one motivators<br/>
Ghetto mentality and the innovators<br/>
Some of y'all may really hate us<br/>
But we won't be soft, all we wanna do is rock<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
We be the crew that presents it on wicked instrumental<br/>
Damagin your mental, from here to Sacramento<br/>
This here groove was made for vintage freestylin<br/>
Feelin like I'm chillin on a Caribbean island<br/>
Rugged, raw material is what we bring forth<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest, we representin up North<br/>
What's that you're sayin in the back, actin all silly<br/>
Kickin freestyle raps, rollin up phillies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
It's the four man fiasco in charge like Roscoe<br/>
Now you get the picture like Picasso<br/>
We make it happen when these niggaz start rappin<br/>
Who this, captain?<br/>
Stick out your hand, you gets no dap and..<br/>
I got the Razor, got the Phife, I got the Shaheed<br/>
Now all you shorties move your ass while you puff weed<br/>
Blessin fans with autographs in my paths<br/>
While other rappers get gassed, they be defeating the task<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
Yo, if I ruled the world<br/>
It wouldn't be that gassed shit, niggaz will make the light swirl<br/>
Cuz after you G, ain't nuthin but Girl...Scouts<br/>
And I'mma show you what it's all about(ah yeah)<br/>
Is what you say when my love is in your mouth<br/>
Without a doubt, I cut MCs like the cord<br/>
Cuz I does more than that MC from The Lords<br/>
While you be froggin like Bud-wei-ser<br/>
And rappin is what you slackin in<br/>
I'm knockin MCs outta action like abstinance<br/>
Rockin since kiss my dick was kickin ass<br/>
Peachfuzz, cuz...you might be on drugs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate<br/>
Motivate, I motivate<br/>
To all my people across the land who get their feet stuck in sand<br/>
Motivate, I motivate y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
A yo, I speak with something new but not Granddaddy I.U.<br/>
Stay tuned, live from the L-B-Q<br/>
A yo, it's destined St. John, I swing on your block<br/>
You know how I get down like Heather B. with them glocks<br/>
I came to lead my team to victory like Hayden Fox<br/>
Cuz heads ain't ready for the willie I got<br/>
Ya naw'mean slim, I dug my thing like them grim<br/>
Leavin crews in state of black and blue like Rakim<br/>
And if you don't know, you better ask another<br/>
It's like 192 when we rollin deep cover<br/>
So don't shut down on the Razor<br/>
Cuz in the 9-Live we steppin through hotter than the Trail Blazers<br/>
And in Queens, I be a legend like Richard Dean<br/>
Son, I gotta team that Hakeem couldn't dream<br/>
While you be standin sellin, Queens keep it live<br/>
Who the hell you tellin (Kim from the Tribe)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Let me tell you why I be the top dog in the industry<br/>
Because all these so-called mutts are not seein me<br/>
They too busy eatin cycles 1, 2 and 3<br/>
They can't MC, I'd rather be down with fuckin Droopy D<br/>
My style is deadly, word bond, act like you fuckin know<br/>
Been writin rhymes ever since Ray Parker sang with Radio<br/>
You're style is played out like a two-tone down goose<br/>
You couldn't Converse if you had fuckin react juice<br/>
So hold your corner as I fuckin bless this mic in here<br/>
I'm eatin through your crew like Stephen King's ankle layers<br/>
Chop off my feet, word to God, I'm gonna hurt you<br/>
(Will y'all fall off?) Will Laura fuck Urkel?<br/>
Never, here comes the funk, smell the aroma<br/>
Kid, my shit's the bomb, ask my peeps from Oklahoma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate<br/>
Motivate, I motivate, I motivate y'all<br/>
To all my people across the land who get stuck in great sand<br/>
Motivate, I motivate y'all<br/>
To all my peoples everywhere throw your mitts in the air<br/>
Motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate<br/>
Can't do nuthin for your frontin, get involved and do somethin<br/>
Motivate, motivate, I motivate, I motivate, I moti...
