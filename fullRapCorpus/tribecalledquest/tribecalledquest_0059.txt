<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Question<br/>
What is it that everybody has<br/>
And some pirates and theives try to take<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Da Booty (and if you is a crook than you takin' it)<br/>
Da Booty (and if you got money you shakin' it)<br/>
Da Booty (come on everybody that's here, that's word <br/>
to Phife Dawg and my man Shaheed)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
I give my promise to all y'all to keep my shit hittin'<br/>
Half of y'all claim dog but now a light kitten<br/>
Flippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton<br/>
Get off that ass and see what I'm settin'<br/>
Born with this inside, you just can't get it<br/>
This is the lethal pop and you have no weapon<br/>
Who is the native brother who keep asses steppin'<br/>
make deep impressions and constantly be reppin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
When I was young I'd stretch gouch yo<br/>
Now I'm on Letterman, on the couch yo<br/>
the black thing with knives is called the back do'<br/>
can't we be cool instead of being foul though<br/>
Ghetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars<br/>
Impressions of live sometimes makes ya holler<br/>
Scream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar<br/>
You dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Phife Dawg puttin' the bite back in yours<br/>
Top dog, puttin' it up, flick his balls<br/>
MC from now til I get a frown<br/>
Shake that ass girl because you world renowned<br/>
Wake up, look at the sun, see the sights<br/>
Bull duke, you've got to die for your rights<br/>
MC's, y'all got to work for the mic<br/>
Zombies, do it from dusk to the night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Rock to the beat, yo it's never the same<br/>
Good girls usually got good game<br/>
Hot cats tearin' that ass out the frills<br/>
Block ass, you had no skills, that's the reals<br/>
Make this money without the friction<br/>
Take this honey, there goes your diction<br/>
Rappers better retreat, fix your joints<br/>
My whole crew got bumps on they points<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
Rumors being spread 'bout me and my click<br/>
We can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shhh<br/>
Might not've heard it, or maybe you have<br/>
Between me and you, they can kiss my ass<br/>
Used to get angry, used to get quite vexed<br/>
But say what you may, just cash my check<br/>
'Cause all I'm ever guilty of is going on tour<br/>
Doing shows galore, and bringin' it raw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
