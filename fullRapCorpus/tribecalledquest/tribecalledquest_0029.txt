<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
Linden Boulevard represent, represent<br/>
Tribe Called Quest represent, represent<br/>
When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant<br/>
My favourite jam back in the day was Eric B. for President<br/>
<br/>
Rude boy composer<br/>
Step to me you're over<br/>
Brothers wanna flex<br/>
Youre not Mad Cobra<br/>
MC short and black<br/>
There aint no other<br/>
Trini-born black like Mia Longs grandmother<br/>
Tip and Sha they all that, Phife-Dawg ditto<br/>
Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow<br/>
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?<br/>
The Five-Foot Assassin knockin fleas off his collar<br/>
Hip-hop scholar since bein knee-high to a duck<br/>
The height of Mugsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck<br/>
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script<br/>
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Queens is in the house represent, represent<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent<br/>
No tamin of the style cuz it gets irreverent<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent<br/>
<br/>
Huh-huh, here we go<br/>
You know that I'm the rebel<br/>
Throwin out the wicked like God did the Devil<br/>
Funky like your grandpas drawers, dont test me<br/>
We in like that, youre dead like Presley<br/>
When we comin through get tickets to see me<br/>
We work for the paper so therell never be a preemie<br/>
Lyrics are abundant cuz we got it by the mass<br/>
Egos are all idle cuz the music is the task<br/>
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it<br/>
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it<br/>
Right<br/>
Now I must move with the quickness<br/>
Here comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Stir It Up <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Steve Biko<br/>
<br/>
Stir It Up <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Steve Biko<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
New York City represent, represent<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent<br/>
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent<br/>
<br/>
MCs like to meddle, but heres my proposition<br/>
I let my lyrics flow, and jumped your whole position<br/>
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after<br/>
Yo Tip settle down, whats the reason for the laughter?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
I really cant say, I guess I laugh to keep from cryin<br/>
So much goin on, people killin, people dyin<br/>
But I wont dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental<br/>
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
Yo I take it back, Im the Indian giver<br/>
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver<br/>
Percussion isnt less, D's wear the vest<br/>
While they dodgin bullets, you should be dodgin Quest<br/>
Dont get me wrong, violence is not our forte<br/>
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pele<br/>
Tip educateem, my rhymes are strictly taboo<br/>
Fill em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Okay<br/>
I am recognizing that the voice inside my head<br/>
is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else<br/>
Because opinions are like voices<br/>
we all have a different kind<br/>
So just clean out all of your ears<br/>
these are my views and you will find that<br/>
we revolutionize over the kick and the snare<br/>
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear<br/>
Soon to be the continent and then the freakin globe<br/>
Theres room for it all as we mingle at the ball<br/>
We welcome competion cuz it doesnt make one lazy or worn<br/>
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card<br/>
Try to be the fattest is the level that we strive<br/>
Try to be the fattest also to stay alive
