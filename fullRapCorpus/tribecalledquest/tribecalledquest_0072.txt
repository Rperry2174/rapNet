<br/>
This is the Lone Ranger<br/>
If you're one of the fortuante to purchase this<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest, The Love Movement album<br/>
You are privliged to witness the first in a series of attempts<br/>
To rectify music from it's rectulness<br/>
Again, this is the Lone Ranger with his first installment<br/>
Money Maker<br/>
Listen<br/>
<br/>
Colder in the winter<br/>
And hotter in the summer<br/>
Get on up<br/>
Get on up<br/>
Live your life right when you be corrupt<br/>
Volcano about to erupt<br/>
Get it up, Get it up, Get it up<br/>
<br/>
Got the motivating joints that keep your ass jumping<br/>
Why when a nigga get on, you want something<br/>
Yo I got the posinious traps for little rats that fiend<br/>
In come the bedroom dream<br/>
Kick it at a slow or at a quick tempo<br/>
A ladies' disposition won't fuck with the mental<br/>
I'm built for conflicts with chicks with issues<br/>
I can lick the wounds bring ease with miss yous<br/>
Bringin' all the pain and makin' things shiver<br/>
The beat make you bite your nails and shit your liver<br/>
And we gonna give a encore performance<br/>
Haters seem doormant while my presence is enormous<br/>
Tarnations, I went gold<br/>
Streesed out with Faith but told cats to get a hold<br/>
Who is the nigga who's mic is stronger<br/>
Rock for an hour and he might rock longer<br/>
Kid you're perplexed, seems I better get to gongin'<br/>
The clean up man, hang you up like on and<br/>
Don't step in the arena, that's a stern warning<br/>
I'm the pops, I raise the sun like morning<br/>
Seems you're still sleeping, hey, stop the yawning<br/>
Open up the blinds and witness the dawning<br/>
The new application and I'm the applier<br/>
And I'm a set it off like fire<br/>
Yeah yeah, that's where it's at<br/>
Make it hot and phat and like Puff (I like that)<br/>
Now I got to urge you on to move ahead<br/>
Don't dread, 'cause I keep the stock in the shed<br/>
And if you need a boost, then I got the jump<br/>
Because we prone to make the party go bump bump bump bump bump bump bump <br/>
Where you is, if you the baby daddy then uplift the kids<br/>
Get back and plan, don't be on front flossin'<br/>
Incognito, you heard the name quite often<br/>
You dressed in black and been issued a coffin<br/>
I thrive on this plain, you off to the lost one<br/>
Like cayon pepper, it gets hot to the better<br/>
&gt;From each little dash it get the whole smash<br/>
It's tasty too, so satisfy your whole pallid<br/>
Fake ID's are revoked, they're invalid<br/>
Infractin' bodies out on the dance floor<br/>
Is what I wanna see, not less but much more<br/>
The lyrics just spewed, he got good reviews<br/>
The kid made the news, how he left no clues<br/>
On how he just murderlized the whole damn jam<br/>
He just got results that's smiles and waved hands<br/>
The mission could never be accomplished, however<br/>
Until we bounce to a autumn where hot weather<br/>
And still we'll be able to rock and rip crowds<br/>
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud<br/>
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud<br/>
If you with the Tribe, chest out and be proud<br/>
<br/>
Shake your money maker<br/>
Shake your money maker<br/>
Shake your money maker<br/>
Shake it, shake it
