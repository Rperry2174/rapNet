I'mma deal with a bigger insult, man<br/>
The heat, the heat, the heat, the heat<br/>
It's comin' down hard<br/>
We've got to get our shit together<br/>
<br/>
It's time to go left and not right<br/>
Gotta get it together forever<br/>
Gotta get it together for brothers<br/>
Gotta get it together for sisters<br/>
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas<br/>
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters<br/>
For Tyson types and Che figures<br/>
Let's get it together, come on let's make it<br/>
Gotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it<br/>
To make something happen, to make something happen<br/>
To make something happen, let's make something happen<br/>
<br/>
Word to Phifer<br/>
Gonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco<br/>
Chilling with the gold microphone cords<br/>
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour<br/>
'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar<br/>
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war<br/>
We about our business, we not quitters<br/>
Not bullshitters, we deliverâ€”we go-get it<br/>
Don't be bitter 'cause we not just niggas<br/>
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth<br/>
Ain't nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off<br/>
Hardest spit in the city y'all niggas spitting kitten soft<br/>
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost<br/>
They planning for our future<br/>
None of our people involved<br/>
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off<br/>
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov<br/>
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off<br/>
It always seems the poorest persons<br/>
Are people forsaken, dawg<br/>
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons<br/>
On the captain's log<br/>
They'd rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog<br/>
Mass un-blackening, it's happening, you feel it y'all?<br/>
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars<br/>
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars<br/>
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing<br/>
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going<br/>
Reputation ain't glowing, reparations ain't flowing<br/>
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing<br/>
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in<br/>
And the car stereo where they would promote the show<br/>
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know<br/>
<br/>
(Move on to the stars)<br/>
There ain't a space program for niggas<br/>
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga<br/>
(Move on to the stars)<br/>
There ain't a space program for niggas<br/>
Yeah, you stuck here nigga<br/>
(Move on to the stars)<br/>
There ain't a space program for niggas<br/>
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga<br/>
(Move on to the stars)<br/>
There ain't a space program for niggas<br/>
Yeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck<br/>
(Move on to the stars)<br/>
<br/>
Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day<br/>
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways<br/>
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined<br/>
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine<br/>
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs<br/>
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine<br/>
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can't breathe<br/>
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave<br/>
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face<br/>
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space<br/>
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all<br/>
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall<br/>
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please<br/>
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty<br/>
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone<br/>
Think the ones who got it<br/>
Would even think to throw you a bone?<br/>
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?<br/>
Nah cypher, probably no place to<br/>
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude<br/>
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude<br/>
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude<br/>
<br/>
Time to go left and not right<br/>
Gotta get it together forever<br/>
Gotta get it together for brothers<br/>
Gotta get it together for sisters<br/>
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas<br/>
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters<br/>
For Tyson types and Che figures<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Gotta get it together for brothers<br/>
Gotta get it together for sisters<br/>
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas<br/>
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters<br/>
For Tyson types and Che figures<br/>
Make make make<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Gotta get it together forever<br/>
Gotta get it together for brothers<br/>
Gotta get it together for sisters<br/>
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas<br/>
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters<br/>
For Tyson types and Che figures<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Gotta get it together for brothers<br/>
Gotta get it together for sisters<br/>
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas<br/>
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters<br/>
For Tyson types and Che figures<br/>
Make make make<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Gotta get it together forever<br/>
Gotta get it together for brothers<br/>
Gotta get it together for sisters<br/>
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas<br/>
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters<br/>
For Tyson types and Che figures<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Gotta get it together for brothers<br/>
Gotta get it together for sisters<br/>
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas<br/>
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters<br/>
For Tyson types and Che figures<br/>
Make, make, make<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen<br/>
<br/>
The danger must be growing<br/>
For the rowers keep on rowing<br/>
And they're certainly not showing<br/>
Any signs that they are slowing!<br/>
"We're there!"<br/>
"Where?"<br/>
"Here!"<br/>
A small step for mankind<br/>
But a giant step for us<br/>
Oompa, loompa, doopa dee doo<br/>
I've got another puzzle for you
