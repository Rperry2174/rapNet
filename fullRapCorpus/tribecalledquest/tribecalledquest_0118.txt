<i>[Chorus Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Oh My God <i>[x16]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Listen up everybody the bottom line<br/>
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined<br/>
With precision like a bullet, target bound<br/>
Just livin like a hooker, the harlett sounds<br/>
Now when I say the harlett, you know I mean the hot<br/>
Heat in the equator, the brothers in the pot<br/>
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip<br/>
Draftin of the poets, I'm the #7 pick<br/>
Licks, licks, licks boy on your backside<br/>
Licks, licks, licks boy on your backside<br/>
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide<br/>
Tip the earthly body<br/>
Heaven's on my side<br/>
Even in Santo Domingo<br/>
Can I gotta Gringo<br/>
Yo, we got mics, when do we go?<br/>
Know a little nigga who can ryhme when you ask me<br/>
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass<br/>
You know the style Tip, now watch me rip this<br/>
I like my beats harder than two day old shit<br/>
Steady eatin booty MCs like cheese grits<br/>
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode<br/>
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue<br/>
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me<br/>
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC<br/>
Now the formula is this...Me, Tip, and Ali<br/>
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3<br/>
The answer...big up is how I be<br/>
Brothas find it's hard to do, but never me<br/>
Some brothas try to dis Malik<br/>
You see'm catchin me<br/>
Don't worry about them booty MCs, my shit be hittin<br/>
Trainin gladiator, anti-hesitator<br/>
Shaheed push the fader from here to Granada<br/>
Mister energetic<br/>
Who me, sound pathetic?<br/>
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?<br/>
I don't know man <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I don't know <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Complimentary it be<br/>
The thief of Poetry<br/>
I got a humdinger comin hook, line and sinker<br/>
The TIMBO hits with the prints underground<br/>
TIMBO's on the toes, i like the way it's goin down<br/>
Down like the lady of the evenin        <br/>
When it goes in hun just beleive the sin<br/>
Cuz Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place<br/>
(Phife: Take off your boots cuz you can't run the race)<br/>
See, this is how we do when we keep it on and on<br/>
Do what...<br/>
Got my man Big Mo with the streets and the papes<br/>
My man Big Mo with the streets and caprice<br/>
This is how we do when we keep the wildin sheets<br/>
Cuz we got to do it like this, we aim to please<br/>
See ya next LP and next CD and next cassette<br/>
Yo, we about to jet<br/>
We A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders<br/>
Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders<br/>
See ya next time cuz we the Midnight Marauders<br/>
A yo, we out cuz we the Midnight Marauders<br/>
Go to the record store and get the shit<br/>
We work hard<br/>
We A Tribe Called Quest and we the Midnight Marauders<br/>
Queens got it's own and Brooklyn got it's own<br/>
Like that
