<i>[chorus George Clinton from Funkadelic's "Let's Take It to the People":]</i><br/>
"Everthing is fair when you're livin in the city" <i>[8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Lookin at Miss Lane, it was the fast lane<br/>
Barely knows her name, struck by fame<br/>
She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends<br/>
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends<br/>
Rollin down the block, checkin out the spots<br/>
She winks at the cops, always give her props<br/>
She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her<br/>
Hangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter<br/>
Tried to make my moves on Miss Lane, she called me young boy<br/>
Told her not to dis me I just want to be your love toy<br/>
You young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly<br/>
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me<br/>
Business oriented, egos never dented<br/>
Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it<br/>
Distractions never hurt, always did the work<br/>
Always was alert, she never got jerked <br/>
Queen of the feats, thrive to compete<br/>
Love the funky beats while she drive down the street<br/>
She was justified, couldn't get a job<br/>
Had to feed her family, so she had to play, then rob<br/>
Pullin out the ooh wop, listenin to doo-wop<br/>
You don't have to say a word<br/>
(gunshots)That's all ya heard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner<br/>
Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater<br/>
Put me on her roster, to rid her of imposters<br/>
And to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler<br/>
Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive<br/>
Plus I needed duckets to fill up my buckets<br/>
Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy<br/>
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction<br/>
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches<br/>
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches<br/>
Cuz if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be<br/>
I'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me<br/>
I played my cards well, try to live swell<br/>
For the G, I would sell, cuz I was deep in hell<br/>
But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin<br/>
Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie<br/>
Elaine, she kinda new, that I would do the do<br/>
But she didn't tear, I did my work with care<br/>
That's all that really mattered, he money never splattered<br/>
As long as she was paid, she was in the shade<br/>
You can't really blame her for holdin on a flamer<br/>
Society taught her, but they didn't tame her<br/>
A ten clip salute, hunny heres a troop<br/>
She will never stop until she reach the top<br/>
Top, top...
