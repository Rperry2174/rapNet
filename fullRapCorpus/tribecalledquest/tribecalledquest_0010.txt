<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Dip dip dive, to the socialised<br/>
Issued rhythms that are on the rise<br/>
Step right up, with an opened circuit<br/>
Get this current, don't you know it's worth it<br/>
Presented with, Tribe's intricity<br/>
Compared, don't you know? Vibe electricity<br/>
Strong like a bomb, quick like a comet<br/>
Can I get whatever from Mr. Muhammad?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ali scratches interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
If Muhammad has the breaks, who will have the backs?<br/>
<i>[whispered]</i> Bodies set it up all flow to rhythm stack<br/>
Okay I see my brother (huh), you know what we can do (what?)<br/>

Posin with the hotties (huh), harder than the hard (hard)<br/>
Still Muhammad plays with a full deck of cards (card)<br/>
The Tribe's stuff is present (yeah), established with the beat (beat)<br/>
We roll around on wheels (huh) or utilise the feet (feet)<br/>
Go and keep progressin (huh), egos of the Tribe (Tribe)<br/>

<br/>
Brothers try to pose, up with the Tribesmen<br/>
Rhythm on your toes, yes it's the funk again<br/>
Appreciate the flow, denounce the circuit breakers<br/>
Do it with the best, the movers and the shakers<br/>
Bustin out your heap, ??? my vehicle<br/>
Burnin up the felts, rhythm's up to me<br/>
It will be strong like a bomb, quick like a comet<br/>
Can I get a whatever from Mr. Muhammad?<br/>
<br/>

Sitting on the dock (huh), fin' to make a wish (word)<br/>

Fondeling the groove (groove), with the mystic sense (sense)<br/>
Honeys won't you try (huh), they push you in the tents (tents)<br/>
But I don't give a damn (word), rhythms make you swing (huh)<br/>
If you don't like it (no), you can pucker up (hoo)<br/>
You listenin Mr. Quayle (yeah), if you're hiding just give up (hoo)<br/>
