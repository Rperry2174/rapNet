<i>[chorus Dove from De La Soul:]</i><br/>
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man<br/>
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand<br/>
New York, NJ, N.C., VA<br/>
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man<br/>
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand<br/>
Oaktown, L.A., San Fran, St. John<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
People give your ears so I be sublime<br/>
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine<br/>
Niggaz, take off your coats ladies, act liike chorus Dove from De La Soul:<br/>
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man<br/>
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand<br/>
New York, NJ, N.C., VA<br/>
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man<br/>
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand<br/>
Oaktown, L.A., San Fran, St. John<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
People give your ears so I be sublime<br/>
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine<br/>
Niggaz, take off your coats ladies, act like GEMS<br/>
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns<br/>
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo<br/>
ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo<br/>
Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo<br/>
On my never endin quest to get the paper on the <br/>
caper<br/>
But now, let me take it to the Queens side<br/>
I'm takin it to Brooklyn side<br/>
All the residential Questers to invade the way<br/>
Hold up a second son, cuz we almost there<br/>
You can be a black man and lose all your soul<br/>
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll<br/>
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and <br/>
dolo<br/>
Of delf for self, see there's no one else <br/>
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that<br/>
So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)<br/>
Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK)<br/>
Do that, do that, do do that that that<br/>
I'm buggin out, so let me get back cuz I'm wettin <br/>
niggaz<br/>
So run and tell the others cuz we are the brothas<br/>
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class<br/>
So give me this award, and let's not make it the <br/>
last<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man<br/>
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand<br/>
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo<br/>
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man<br/>
Goin each and every place with the mic in their hand<br/>
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Back in '89, I simply slid into place<br/>
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face<br/>
A lot of kids was bustin rhymes but they had no <br/>
taste<br/>
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case<br/>
I have a quest to have the mic in my hand<br/>
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman<br/>
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts<br/>
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt<br/>
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy<br/>
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy<br/>
Top notch baby, never comin less<br/>
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest<br/>
Sit back , relax, get up out the path<br/>
If not that, here's the dancefloor, come move that <br/>
ass<br/>
Non-believers, you can check the stats<br/>
I roll with Shaheed and the brotha Abstract<br/>
Niggaz know the time when the Quest is in the jam<br/>
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am<br/>
Comin with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees<br/>
Livin mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi<br/>
The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh<br/>
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft<br/>
So, next time that you think you want somethin here<br/>
Make somethin deffer, take that garbage to St. <br/>
Elsewhere<br/>
<br/>
