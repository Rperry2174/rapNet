<i>[Intro: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
<br/>
One two, one two<br/>
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down<br/>
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound<br/>
It go<br/>
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same<br/>
And when it comes to rippin mics aiyyo it ain't no games<br/>
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo you know it's Busta Rhymes, ev-ery time<br/>
Oh yes, I'm comin wicked with the new design<br/>
I'm sayin<br/>
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes<br/>
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time<br/>
The time is eternal when you play with the miser<br/>
Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser<br/>
The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint<br/>
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point<br/>
Brothers need to come, with better, compositions<br/>
I write, and recite, to make, good position<br/>
In this, rap game here, we en-gineer<br/>
Stabbin up the jam yeah son shit's clear<br/>
And I be kickin rhymes in my own damn way<br/>
Beatin niggaz to the punch like Sugar Ray<br/>
Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool<br/>
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool<br/>
Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'<br/>
Do a little somethin when I'm out on tour<br/>
Comin thru like narcotics for the antibiotics<br/>
Flappin shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets<br/>
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass<br/>
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last<br/>
Let the good times roll, cuz we in control<br/>
Take you out on your high less you payin a toll<br/>
Let the good times roll, let the good times toll<br/>
Take you out on your high less you payin a toll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Question<br/>
Why is that, MC's be wack<br/>
And major labels wanna sound like crap<br/>
Aiyyo Funk Dat!<br/>
Word to life I'm comin rugged<br/>
Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love<br/>
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it<br/>
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Renuse it<br/>
Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap<br/>
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap<br/>
The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff style<br/>
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild<br/>
So bust what I'm swingin what I'm swingin when I swing<br/>
I rap when I rap cuz I never wanna sing<br/>
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle<br/>
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle<br/>
Rude bwoy official comin with the ill grammar<br/>
Comin back on kids, like Joey Montana<br/>
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty<br/>
Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinatti<br/>
So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man<br/>
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself<br/>
Cuz all deez bitin MC's, lawd dem somethin else<br/>
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt<br/>
Money on my mind so never mind a trick<br/>
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks<br/>
World's greatest five footer rippin parties apart<br/>
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark<br/>
Never had to rhyme about feelin what with lead<br/>
NEVER MIND DAT MON HERE COME DE DREAD<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
<br/>
We comin farrrr farrrr farrrr<br/>
Busta Rhymes is comin farrrr farrr farr<br/>
ya know ya hear me Star!<br/>
Bet your bottom dollah<br/>
Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow<br/>
Whether it be to-day or to-morrow<br/>
Niggaz be collaboratin sickening<br/>
you beat them like they father<br/>
Ohhhhh shit check out what I saying<br/>
Ah-hah ah-hah ohhhhh ah-hah ah-hah<br/>
You know my niggaz don't be playing<br/>
Once upon a mah-hah-hacking time<br/>
I received the opportuni-ties to represent my first rhymes<br/>
To define, lyrical sensations<br/>
Black masons blowin up the spot<br/>
Just to represent the Nations<br/>
Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes<br/>
Fat like a burger and fries<br/>
Mama-so-mama-saa-mamma-ma-ko-sah<br/>
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama<br/>
Eeeyah!! Bring it to the table at the meetings<br/>
Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings<br/>
As I carry on with my proceedings<br/>
Greetings!!  Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings<br/>
But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place<br/>
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race<br/>
Sit dog sit!<br/>
Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit!
