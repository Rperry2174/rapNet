<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
The mad man Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia<br/>
Maybe that'll ease ya<br/>
Master of this microphone mackin, master as in great<br/>
I'll have your brain goin in circles as my style tends to ovulate<br/>
I'm makin moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me<br/>
Retrace, won't, so your stubborn like groupies<br/>
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart<br/>
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks<br/>
While you playin hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey<br/>
Cuz I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley<br/>
Dissin around with wack rhymin<br/>
You lose your grip from chalk climbin<br/>
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman<br/>
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved<br/>
But see me, you don't wanna see me, cuz all MCs are gettin served<br/>
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer<br/>
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cypher<br/>
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame<br/>
Cuz rappin ain't no game, big up your head and maintain<br/>
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin any beef <br/>
Ain't nuthin sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin street<br/>
Phife Dawg, swingin it back and forth just like Aaliyah<br/>
Makin moves on your heart like that trick Tamia<br/>
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death<br/>
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus cuz I'm losin my breath<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
A, yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene<br/>
We got the fiend bumpin straight from the borough Queens<br/>
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene<br/>
We got the fiend bumpin straight from the borough Queens<br/>
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene<br/>
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism<br/>
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism<br/>
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism<br/>
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin izm<br/>
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I be lettin off gism<br/>
Writin rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism<br/>
I gotta brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm<br/>
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him<br/>
Got the Lightro in the back talkin bout (come on, get him)<br/>
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip  em<br/>
Sucka MC in my path, hey main, I say we ship him<br/>
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin<br/>
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin<br/>
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin<br/>
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute<br/>
Have you walkin through your projects in your birthday suit<br/>
Cuz your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute<br/>
If youse a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke<br/>
My style is, everday all day, similar to water<br/>
Crushin MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter<br/>
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna<br/>
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter<br/>
Hey, I tried to warn her<br/>
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill<br/>
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill <br/>
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear<br/>
Singin good stuff in my ear, runnin fingers through my hair<br/>
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations<br/>
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations<br/>
Chillin with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians<br/>
Ya naw'mean<br/>
<br/>
Word up<br/>
I just wanna big up everybody for supportin A Tribe Called Quest <br/>
Through the years<br/>
This be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin?<br/>
Tip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life<br/>
Featuring my man, you know what I'm sayin, Consequence<br/>
192 is the area where we represent, for the ladies and gents, ha ha<br/>
You know what I'm sayin? Big up Shaheed Muhammad, that's my man<br/>
Christine, you know what I'm sayin, word life (fading out)<br/>
The Abstract Poetic, rockin this track <br/>
Bouncin it all over the place, in your face<br/>
You know what I'm sayin? My man Lightro...
