<i>[Verse 1: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other.<br/>
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast.<br/>
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed<br/>
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail.<br/>
<i>[?]</i> on sale, your rumour starts to wail.<br/>
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail.<br/>
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?<br/>
They'll put you back to France on a ship with a sail.<br/>
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails.<br/>
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)<br/>
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris,<br/>
Came to America to find liberty.<br/>
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery,<br/>
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me.<br/>
Oh, luck luck will drive you butt baddy.<br/>
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy.<br/>
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could,<br/>
But listen, brother man, I really think you can.<br/>
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back.<br/>
It's the creme de la creme, and you can bounce with that.<br/>
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice.<br/>
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life.<br/>
Lucine, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien.<br/>
You should know!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Are you ready, Lu?<br/>
This one is for you,<br/>
Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe.<br/>
Como esta usted or como talle vu?<br/>
Lucien, I'll leave it up to you.<br/>
Voulez vous (vous).<br/>
Endez vous (vous).<br/>
Coo-coo (coo).<br/>
Les poo-poo (poo)<br/>
Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast.<br/>
Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip?<br/>
Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin',<br/>
VCR from a neck-bone bummin',<br/>
$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin',<br/>
Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin',<br/>
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin',<br/>
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'.<br/>
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific.<br/>
This is a song that is long and prolific.<br/>
Think of the stuff that I said if you can.<br/>
Figure it out, compute, understnad.<br/>
No problemo, I'll help you with your demo<br/>
If you go to the store for me.<br/>
Lucien, I'm just kiddin'.<br/>
You should know!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin',<br/>
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition.<br/>
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance<br/>
With the French "savoir faire" and the sexy dance,<br/>
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?<br/>
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try.<br/>
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?<br/>
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?<br/>
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad.<br/>
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like<br/>
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes,<br/>
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues.<br/>
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown.<br/>
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound.<br/>
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup,<br/>
Young and naive, it's hard to believe.<br/>
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the questers,<br/>
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester.<br/>
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien.<br/>
You should know!
