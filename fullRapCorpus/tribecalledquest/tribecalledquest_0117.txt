<i>[Chorus x12]</i><br/>
Mr. Incognito, Incognito<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah yeah<br/>
Mr. Incognito is back again<br/>
Now all I want is peace and papes, and a physical frame<br/>
Jottin down my list of positives in life<br/>
I want a ride, crib, mud, wife<br/>
The look on my girl is filled with conviction<br/>
Gonna get what I need, the league restriction<br/>
Babble on the Boulevard to brother hood buddies<br/>
Pokin in my pocket it's the E for the moneys<br/>
Jay and all the jokes that jet in the jetters<br/>
While I'm at the booth tube watchin ?beretta?<br/>
Swig up on a forty cause I'm feelin thirsty<br/>
Mama says she taught me, better say she cursed me<br/>
Throwin on my hoodie low-profilin, whassup with the Twister<br/>
Brother man be wildin<br/>
While I be on mission that's beyond eye level<br/>
Questin out the devil and this styles that I sever-<br/>
-al Quest with the Questers, a Quest on a solo<br/>
Boomin in a Benzo, Beamer or a Bronco<br/>
Boom pack a boom boom, boom pack a boom<br/>
If my sight isn't seen, silly saps will assume<br/>
That we fallin off the earth with the Nina and the pensa<br/>
The Five Foot Assasin with the shade of magenta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Magenta is the shade for the mystic parade<br/>
Physical Trini boy lyrically I enstrain<br/>
Livin of Lyndon 1-92nd<br/>
Chillin at the rest other brothers wreck it<br/>
Easy like I'm on it, Commodore Sunday<br/>
Waited for tuesday, fourmatic monday<br/>
When I woke wednesday persons was groundin<br/>
Don't know the whereabouts can't be foundin<br/>
Chillin for the villain the one they call the Phifer<br/>
Still on the smooth but a tidbit hyper<br/>
Get with the gat one as I hit the D-L<br/>
It's my thing what I ring I try to do it well<br/>
You can bet your bottom dollar that the Tribe will not be slippin<br/>
Makin hit after hit as we commence to start rippin<br/>
People think I'm buggin or I have the heebiejeebies<br/>
The reason they can't find me is because they can't see me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x12]</i><br/>
Mr. Incognito, Incognito<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
It's like the war's goin on in the middle of your mind<br/>
But your mind can't contain Incognito's on the brain<br/>
So you chill by yourself don't really sweat nobody<br/>
Speak to all the brothers and say peace to every hottie<br/>
But lurkin in the ghetto is a germ that insist<br/>
Shoot you back the german away or utilise your fists<br/>
Neither of the two, just continue with your thoughts<br/>
And rush away your pain with the power of the thought<br/>
Ain't got no time for girls, cause girls be on some bull<br/>
Checkin for a nigga who got crazy pull<br/>
On some deep rooted sexual, highly intellectual<br/>
Not checkin for the fame although it's propetual<br/>
I enter the world the same way I'll exit<br/>
If you really think the groove, than hey glad you checked it<br/>
Cause Incognito's strong not urkin like a blister<br/>
Before you speak about me, make sure you call me Mister<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
