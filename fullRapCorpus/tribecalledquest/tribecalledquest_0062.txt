<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Who that at the door? (Yo, Tip, it's her)<br/>
What you doin here, in front of my face? <i>[x3]</i><br/>
You didn't want my...you didn't want it<br/>
To go somewhere, you all on it<br/>
But if you want to, then you can come here<br/>
Come here, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Have you ever met a woman that just took your breath?<br/>
So deep inside her life, she contemplated death<br/>
Can't help but get attatched to a woman like that (true dat) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
The contact was quite immediate, I had to attack<br/>
(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)<br/>
We related and debated over food and tunes<br/>
Started out in September, now we enterin June (say word) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Simple night in the crib, no, it just won't do <br/>
(no it just won't do, no it just won't do)<br/>
Because she liable to start shit that's wildin you <br/>
(wildin you, wildin...)<br/>
She wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips<br/>
And take on trips, conversin my flip<br/>
Gotta do her hair, take her out to the fair<br/>
When a jake be there, make sure you don't stare<br/>
At another one comin, don't be startin nuthin<br/>
Be a slave to her, don't be brave to her<br/>
Make sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong<br/>
When she wants to do it, make sure that it's long<br/>
f anyone wanna make it work it's me (Phife Dawg help me out) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
But we gotta come through with common ground baby<br/>
Any man, he can claim to be the one for you<br/>
But put it straight to your lover in life runs true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
And if it's me then let's get it going on <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Get it going on, let's get it going on<br/>
And if it's me then let's get it going on <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Phife Dawg in the break, is she more than you can take?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
See, I'm not the one to be taken advantage of<br/>
And if you really think about it, I got nuthin but love<br/>
Now if your heart isn't in it, please let me know<br/>
There's no need to waste time, if it's no, then I'll go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
And if it's me then let's get it going on <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Get it going on, let's get it going on<br/>
And if it's me then let's get it going on <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Get it going on, let's get it going on
