<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
In this American metropolis filled with MC's<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease<br/>
Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody<br/>
Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin'<br/>
The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau<br/>
To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations<br/>
A god-fearin' folk cos we all from the yolk<br/>
Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed<br/>
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence<br/>
Even though not too long ago I was a truant<br/>
Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics<br/>
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets<br/>
Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky<br/>
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me<br/>
Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats<br/>
Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat<br/>
But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?<br/>
It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable<br/>
I be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet<br/>
And fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year<br/>
All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near<br/>
All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest<br/>
It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess<br/>
So I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps)<br/>
Wit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)<br/>
Step back, me no have no time for dat<br/>
I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots<br/>
In a world where you have like a zillion MC's<br/>
Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs<br/>
Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know<br/>
I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low<br/>
(His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat)<br/>
Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross<br/>
Queens representation, son, you know how we do<br/>
While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest<br/>
I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat<br/>
Yo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that<br/>
My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop<br/>
Come on party people, you must give me my props<br/>
Cos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered<br/>
So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards<br/>
Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?<br/>
Queens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
<br/>
We feelin' pressures in here<br/>
You know we feelin' pressures<br/>
Feelin' pressures in here<br/>
You know we feelin' pressures<br/>
We gotta stand clear<br/>
Jus' gotta stand clear<br/>
Gotta gotta stand clear of the pressure<br/>
The what?
