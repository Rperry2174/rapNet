<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
As we start trudgin, me and my brothers we be lookin and be buggin<br/>
Vehicles of life they be rollin and be mergin<br/>
Searchin for the virgins of life<br/>
that be shovin out the door that's crack<br/>
The valleys of time, are always on my feet<br/>
As least the beat will combine<br/>
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline<br/>
You don't need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat<br/>
Well can I get a level on the bass and on the treble<br/>
Footin up and down like a UNLV Rebel<br/>
The answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics<br/>
Can't be too much flackin, not too much packin<br/>
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap<br/>
Your feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact<br/>
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted<br/>
This ain't rock 'n' roll cos the rap is in control<br/>
If you're a megastar, worth will buy you a car<br/>
I'd rather go barefootin, for prints I will be puttin<br/>
all over the earth if we can get there first<br/>
Now that we are in it, footprints are bein printed<br/>
So fi you recognise em, you can try to size em<br/>
They'll probably be the ones with the size not fryin<br/>
all over reveal, you won't have to yield<br/>
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock<br/>
But we walk while we talk as we stompin through the block<br/>
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade<br/>
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade<br/>
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon<br/>
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond<br/>
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail<br/>
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail<br/>
See the levels peakin as the rhythms keep-a screechin<br/>
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preachin<br/>
the point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far<br/>
The loudiness is ringin as we scoot across the star<br/>
We are bulgin, I'm indulgin in a rat-a-tat-tat<br/>
Explanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat<br/>
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep<br/>
But dig it in the ground because the foot print now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
If there's a storm that's brewin, it won't keep us from doin<br/>
our thing as we start swingin, travellin is bringin<br/>
joy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/Rome<br/>
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home<br/>
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town<br/>
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place<br/>
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger<br/>
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer<br/>
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that<br/>
Remember me, the brother who said "Black is black"<br/>
You can come by request, I don't play, I don't dress<br/>
Get emotions off your chest, we are black, we the best<br/>
Makin moves, makin motions, flowin like an ocean<br/>
The walkin will continue, we know that we will bring you<br/>
the times that you have waited, more anticipated<br/>
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong
