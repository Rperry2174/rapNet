<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Here in 1992, we present the fabulous what's the Scenario remix<br/>
Where as there are 7 MCs.<br/>
Six which are in physical form, one which is in spiritual essence<br/>
And he goes by the name of, uh...HOOD!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hood:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check the vibe, punk that ass again, god<br/>
'F' it (SHIITT!!) ! I lay buckshots<br/>
Hood, madman, I rip up stages<br/>
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis<br/>
Extra, extra, pick up a clip. I'll tear that ass out the frame (HUH!)<br/>
And grab my dick(OH!)<br/>
By the beats that I bump, I kick and drop bombs<br/>
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty<br/>
A musical badder bastard, I'm bad news<br/>
I'm crazy and clever, cut holes in crews<br/>
Death on the phono, my skills are dolo<br/>
You say 'oh no', you bitch ass homo<br/>
I bag up waste, electrifying, I'm primetime<br/>
I slaughter slime, I'm the greatest of all time<br/>
Sick ass brotha, nasty ass nigga<br/>
Pump slugs in your face and jump that ass in the river<br/>
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can (SAY WHAT, SAY WHAT!!!)<br/>
I'm a bad, bad man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip<br/>
Punchin out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips<br/>
The 5 foot assassin has just raided your area<br/>
Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason why I'm hearin ya (SO!)<br/>
Pull out the red carpet cuz I'm kickin this<br/>
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous<br/>
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew<br/>
And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, 'F' you too<br/>
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to<br/>
You better off callin D-Nice to your rescue<br/>
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around<br/>
As for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I 'Shut 'Em Down'<br/>
The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop<br/>
The 5 foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop<br/>
So do like Michael Jackson and 'Remember the TIme'(DO YOU REMEMBER?)<br/>
Put on your dancin shoes or somethin cuz you sho' can't rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Milo:]</i><br/>
<br/>
(BIG UP BIG UP!) Into new eternity<br/>
Next was said somethin that complies onto me<br/>
What does it take to check a technique (MANY STYLES, MANY STYLES!)<br/>
Hostile heat brings forth the energy<br/>
Milo in the dance is the new identity<br/>
One, two mic check, select for the ruffneck<br/>
At a 10 to 1 bet, I come CORRECT!<br/>
In my cyphers are blocks, I bring box to connect with knots<br/>
So I can grow dreadlocks<br/>
Maintain the rock DON'T STOP THE ROCK!!!)<br/>
Maintain the rock (DON'T STOP THE ROCK!!!)<br/>
Kick it right, then not, E. Watt said not<br/>
I put my mug up, so fair is fair<br/>
So C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeah!)<br/>
C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeah!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Brown:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Makin moves y'all (MOVES Y'ALL!)<br/>
On and on and on (CHECKA, CHECK IT OUT!!!)<br/>
To the breaka, breakadawn (WHO'S THAT?!?)<br/>
Guess, one of the LONS and A Tribe Called Quest<br/>
(EAST COAST!) to West<br/>
Remixed mad kick more than Metallica<br/>
To all ends like the Battlestar Gallactica<br/>
Stampin, stompin, rompin Compton<br/>
(PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD!!!) I'm promptin (STYLE!)<br/>
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle<br/>
Representation, sensationalization<br/>
Scenario for the radio, BLS and KISS, so<br/>
(HERE WE GO, YO!) Yeah<br/>
Force, Main Source LP on the rise<br/>
In Living Color was seen through original eyes<br/>
And I'm out like shout, Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh<br/>
(OOH AHH, OOH AHH!) There it is baby par<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dinco:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Vine, limb on a limb, slim chim<br/>
P I am, there I am (THERE I AM!)<br/>
Don't run from a blim<br/>
Sight be be right, be polite for mice like a Mike<br/>
SEE SICK, SEE SYKE<br/>
And slip away and off to the Poconos <br/>
Spot bring the flows, might swing the fruity poles<br/>
Yamaha (YAY-HA-MAY!)<br/>
Let's split the funk, now it all spells (HEY!)<br/>
Enough, enough, misfitted I'm with it<br/>
If I did it, I would split it and probably shouldn't have quit<br/>
Cuz yo, my public status act Knight like Gladys<br/>
Take rest space tests and yo, I'm like the maddest<br/>
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale<br/>
Bounce the beat for the beat pole cuz beats are bein yelled<br/>
In the hallway always ringin with a HO!<br/>
This is my 2 times 9 on the Scenario<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it out everybody, rhymes and mics<br/>
Black mens gettin hip, DOIN WHAT THEY LIKE!<br/>
Eight black brothas in the public eye<br/>
If you listen very close, then I'll tell you why<br/>
HOOD!, Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown<br/>
Shaheed, myself and Busta Bust Brown<br/>
Will commence to rock (ROCK!), so bring on the flocks (FLOCKS!)<br/>
Interrogation for the knockin of the box<br/>
The boom-box ruler controls the medula<br/>
None come cooler, I win like Shula<br/>
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her<br/>
Intensified mind, non blunt consumer<br/>
Tip will come booty (WELL, IT'S ONLY A RUMOR!)<br/>
The beat is so sick, that it starts brain tumors (TUMORS!)<br/>
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner<br/>
Smoke him up later, if not, then sooner<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey what we gon DO! in '92, even though we had FUN! in '91<br/>
Quick to turn my day, all things comin down<br/>
Run up on the new sound, leavin cracks in the ground<br/>
What's goin on my man (GOD DAMN!) and now my brain is hurtin<br/>
Busta, rhythm will hit 'em, then I get 'em<br/>
Rip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em<br/>
Open up your mouth if you want the food<br/>
Take in full, Flipmode, cuz I'm in the mood, Uh-heh, uh-heh<br/>
Yeah man, that's how it goes<br/>
Body drippin with blood comin out your nose<br/>
Give me a band-aid, what are you askin for? (MORE!)<br/>
All in your secret and pure<br/>
Adverse, they said, check it and I bust a new rap<br/>
Rap, Busta Rhymes, and bust this wicked rap<br/>
Yeah y'all in '92, I'm packin my ant spray (ANYWAY!)<br/>
Tickle it, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School<br/>
Mad brothas would still think...Rhow, Rhow, Rhow!!!<br/>
To my dragon, baby, stop whining<br/>
I see my influence still shining<br/>
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo<br/>
That's the Scenario!
