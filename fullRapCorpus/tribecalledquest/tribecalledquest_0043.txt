<i>[intro fading in:]</i> Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting,<br/>
drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting by, totally. Drifting<br/>
by(just)totally. Drifting by(just)totally<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
The deadly venom, let me start from the beginning<br/>
We always hittin, so yo, there'll be no extra innings<br/>
As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson<br/>
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action<br/>
The coming attraction(what!)<br/>
The main feature<br/>
And I'ma greet ya, like a rhymin ass creature<br/>
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts<br/>
The brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start<br/>
And that's me Akki, as long as the ladies move they bodies<br/>
We'll have a four-on-two stand<br/>
Cuz that happens to be the nature of man<br/>
Sexuality, it is the format baby<br/>
Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes<br/>
But I praise Lord in the worlds that's unseen<br/>
Respect me for that and let me do my thing(just)<br/>
I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Drifting by)You know we gotta get a hold<br/>
(totally) Over the illest drum rolls<br/>
(totally drifting by just...)<br/>
<br/>
Yo, how you doin? Let me give you an intro<br/>
My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info <br/>
Got the diamond in the back, and the sunroof shit<br/>
That makes the hardcore MCs resort to being bitch<br/>
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich<br/>
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it<br/>
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick<br/>
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit<br/>
Denouncin my beliefs, well then your wig get split<br/>
Lay your ego on the ground so that you'll benefit<br/>
You can take these words and relay it to your click<br/>
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips<br/>
The Tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit<br/>
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit<br/>
My record company be on some  true jerk shit<br/>
But that's i-ight. Now, I'm on some true work shit<br/>
And I'ma make it happen for my whole outfit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Drifting by)You know we got to get control<br/>
(totally)Over the illest drum rolls<br/>
(totally drifting by just...)Third verse<br/>
<br/>
A-yo, we just gettin started<br/>
Got to redirect this vision<br/>
Got the beauty of a flower<br/>
Plus dimensions like a prism <br/>
Your minds are locked down like prison<br/>
Y'all really need to go lay down<br/>
Cuz positivity has risen<br/>
We hittin<br/>
Yo bust how we too strong to be broken<br/>
Occasional malfunction pressure time<br/>
We ain't jokin<br/>
For security we on this run like Logan<br/>
Kamaal's doin the hustle<br/>
And you backstage voguin<br/>
We all got flaws<br/>
Don't ever try to think that you perfect<br/>
We all are human beings <br/>
There's bullshit at the surface <br/>
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme <br/>
Damn, we ain't prophets<br/>
And if you think so, you need to stop it<br/>
So jump back inside your shell<br/>
Let your million dollar thoughts propel<br/>
But next man don't get jel<br/>
Playa hate that all carries weight <br/>
That we don't need<br/>
We slim with disabilities and<br/>
Thick with possibilities<br/>
Cuz then you can't move with fertility<br/>
Navigatin with good visibility<br/>
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities<br/>
Let's strive to get this constant money activity<br/>
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel<br/>
So if you get enraged with these names it still rebels<br/>
There ain't no plan B's <br/>
Yo watch, we movin through with plan A<br/>
Money market doin things the right way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Totally)You know we got to get control<br/>
(Drifting by, just)Over the illest drum roll<br/>
(Totally drifting by just...) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
(Totally just(x2), Drifting by <i>[x2]</i> in background) <br/>
Yo bust it out section, section.<br/>
Section Linden Boulevard<br/>
Section on Merrick<br/>
Section the whole Jamaica<br/>
Section on Flushing<br/>
Section in Bed-Stiduy
