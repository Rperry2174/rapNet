<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Fuck the car-jacking, Phife Diggy is rapping<br/>
Got dawgs with love and plus dawgs that's packin<br/>
So what's the deal Captain, if it's time for some action<br/>
Watch me roll with hon, try to push her back<br/>
Which one of these niggaz, think they fuckin wit dis?<br/>
Put your money on Queens, yo these cats is pissed<br/>
Meanin hot green and stinky, see shorty there winkin?<br/>
Hit her off so hard, that her eyes start blinkin<br/>
Then massage her down, with the word serene<br/>
It's the Dawg For Pres, new star on the scene<br/>
And I'm here for the battle, right down to the letter<br/>
If it rains today, then it's a double-header<br/>
Range Beemaz and Benz, 1100's and Jettas<br/>
Phife Dawg for whatever, just get it together<br/>
<br/>
(Just) get it together<br/>
(Just) get it together<br/>
(Just) get it together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Just get it together<br/>
No matter the weather, or where you at<br/>
This is how we gon' do it, cause we keep shit fat<br/>
You gotta<br/>
<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it<br/>

<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Didn't you read the news, did you heed the alarm<br/>
It was good overall, it said that we was the bomb<br/>
I'ma make the call, and I hope you respond<br/>
We the stars y'all, and everyone beckons far<br/>
You a star and you shining, I'm one and I'm rhyming<br/>
Let's get together, start intertwining<br/>
Yo you coming with me, somewhere where you can't see<br/>
with his bonafide joints, underneath the sea<br/>
Of confusion and glitter, nobody's a quitter<br/>
Try to front and get ripped, from your ear to your shitter<br/>
Gon' put it on harder than anyone did<br/>
It would benefit you to keep a wide open lid<br/>
Makin sho' shot shit, makin sure you shine<br/>
Takin shows for sure, takin hearts in time<br/>
Do it all for the rhyme, and the rhythm and things<br/>
When we do it we bangin, like we inside the bang<br/>
Ain't doubtin nobody, when we inside the jam<br/>
But I'm proud overall, and I know who I am<br/>
As the constellation gets brighter this writer's goin<br/>
<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo yo) do it<br/>
(yo yo) do it (yo, yo) do it<br/>
