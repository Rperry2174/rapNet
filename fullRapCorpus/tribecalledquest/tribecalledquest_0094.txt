"hey sucka nigga, whoever you are" <i>[x2]</i><br/>
"hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga<br/>
 whoever you are, whoever you are"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Aiyyo, turn it up Muhammad<br/>
Turn everything up in the headphones<br/>
so I don't lose my vocals<br/>
Yeah that's good, turn my vocals a little bit<br/>
with the upper bassline<br/>
<br/>
I be hatin sucka MC's, and the sucka niggas<br/>
Posing like they hard when we know they damn card<br/>
what you figure, rhyme-wise, I do the figure eight<br/>
So concisely, musically we are the herb so sit back<br/>
and light me, inhale *inhalation noise*<br/>
My style is kinda fat reminescent of a whale<br/>
Young girls desires for the females dreams<br/>
I be the Abstract Poetic representin from Queens<br/>
Socially I'm not a name, black and white got game<br/>
If you came to the jam, well I'm glad you came<br/>
See, nigga first was used back in the Deep South<br/>
Fallin out between the dome of the white man's mouth<br/>
It means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy<br/>
Other niggas in the community think it's crummy<br/>
But I don't, neither does the youth cause we<br/>
em-brace adversity it goes right with the race<br/>
And being that we use it as a term of endearment<br/>
Niggas start to bug to the dome is where the fear went<br/>
Now the little shorties say it all of the time<br/>
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme<br/>
Yo I start to flinch, as I try not to say it<br/>
But my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it<br/>
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it<br/>
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray the<br/>
<br/>
Sucka nigga, nigga nigga<br/>
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front<br/>
The sucka niggas, nigga nigga<br/>
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front<br/>
The sucka niggas, nigga nigga<br/>
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front<br/>
It's the neo-nigga of the nineties, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
I be hatin sucka MC's, and the sucka niggas<br/>
Posin like they hard when we know they damn card<br/>
what you figure, rhyme-wise, I do the figure eight<br/>
So concisely, musically we are the herb so sit back<br/>
and light me *inhalation noise* inhale *echoes*<br/>
My style is kinda fat reminescent of a whale<br/>
Young girls desires for the females dreams<br/>
I be the Abstract Poetic representin from Queens<br/>
Socially I'm not a name, black and white got game<br/>
If you came to the jam well I'm glad you came<br/>
See, nigga first was used down in the Deep South<br/>
Fallin out between the dome of the white man's mouth<br/>
It means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy<br/>
Other niggas in the community think it's crummy<br/>
But I don't, neither does the youth cause we<br/>
em-brace adversity it goes right with the race<br/>
Yo I start to flinch, as I try not to say it<br/>
But my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it<br/>
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it<br/>
My lips is like a oowop, yo you know the rest<br/>
<br/>
The sucka niggas, niggas niggas<br/>
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front<br/>
The sucka niggas, nigga nigga<br/>
I throw the suckas in the front for the ones that front<br/>
The sucka niggas, nigga nigga<br/>
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front<br/>
Sucka niggas, nigga nigga<br/>
Aiyyo Shaheed, take us the fuck outta here
