<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Somethin for your earhole, so you can clean them shits out<br/>
It seems that some don't understand what I'm talkin about<br/>
How you get West coast nigga, from West coast hater?<br/>
I could never dis a whole coast, my time is too greater(true)<br/>
Yeah, we from the East, the land of originators<br/>
You also from the West, the land of innovators<br/>
The only difference of the two is the style of the rap<br/>
Plus the musical track, this beef shit is so wack<br/>
Let me let y'all brothas know I ain't no West coast disser<br/>
Another thing I'm not is a damn ass kisser<br/>
So listen to my words as I set things straight<br/>
I ain't got no beef, so don't come in my face <br/>

Keep it movin, yeah to the K.I.M.<br/>

<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Hip hop...a way of life<br/>
It doesn't tell you how to raise a child or treat a wife<br/>
I verbalize over...rhyme friendly<br/>
That puts a listener in a frenzy, so pop me in your Benzi<br/>
You dig it? Get wit it or get your melon splitted<br/>
If you ever try to combat, Sir Walter moves the king<br/>
We got the illy team that doesn't even sweat the gleam<br/>
Or glamour, we'll figure 4 your ass like Greg the Hammer<br/>
Man, we rockin joints like The Who or Santana<br/>
Keep jams packed and hotter than Havana<br/>
Positivity is the key in the lock<br/>
Put your hand on it, turn it to the right, ak<br/>
We doin daredevil dandies on these mics<br/>
Peace out to the whole Hiero who's puffin on the hydro<br/>
Yeah dun, we movin how we like<br/>
Since the days of rockin hi-los, we keepin things on pyro, fire<br/>
As we move with zeal and desire<br/>
Now, the hip hop plan, hope you complier<br/>
Son, we havin tunnel vision but my sight is real real broad<br/>
Cuz I can't afford to miss that call<br/>
Makin moves, not movies, as get on the ball<br/>
And we keepin things covered like a female shawl<br/>
When I watch hockey, yo, I just look for the brawl<br/>
Quest, Quest and you know we signin out y'all<br/>
<br/>
Keep it movin, yeah yeah, to the K.I.M.<br/>
Keep it movin, yeah yeah, to the K.I.M.<br/>
I ain't got no time for schuckin and jivin<br/>
Keep it movin, yeah yeah<br/>
Keep it movin, yeah yeah, to the K.I.M.<br/>
Keep it movin, true dat, to the K.I.M.<br/>
