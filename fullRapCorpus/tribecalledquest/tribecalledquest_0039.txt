<i>[BizMarkie]</i> "I'm bout to wreck ya body and say turn the party out"<br/>
<i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Them can't touch me no, them can't touch me<br/>
Them can't hold me no, them can't hold me <i>[2X]</i><br/>
(<i>[Q-Tip:]</i> Damn, Phife you got fat!)<br/>
Yeah, I know it looks pathetic<br/>
Ali Shaheed Muhammad got me doing calisthenics<br/>
Needless to say, boy I'm bad to the bone<br/>
Making love to my mic like Jarobi on the phone<br/>
But um, no time for jokes (what!), there's bills to be paid (what!)<br/>
Hoes to be laid (what!), punks to be sprayed (what!)<br/>
Chumps to attack, so my man watch your back<br/>
Cuz '93 means skills are a must, so never lack (uh!)<br/>
Sit back and learn, come now watch the birdie<br/>
Your styles are incomplete, same as Vinny Testaverde<br/>
Battlin, whenever -- hot Damn!<br/>
Give me the microphone bwoy, one time, bam!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Keep it on the corner, cuz here comes the heat<br/>
Lyrically it stays, the jazz will pace the beat<br/>
As we proceed to elevate you, we in fo-fo<br/>
Run and tell your dad the Abstract's the bag<br/>
As we proceed to move your high parts, we know who has ass<br/>
Poets got the gimmicks, but they lack the sassafras<br/>
To make the average hardrock and cock the glock<br/>
And roam the city streets on the jury, they hot <br/>
I be ingredients, like sugar and candy<br/>
If your life is broke, girl I'll be the handy-dandy<br/>
That commends you, my fee is a shower<br/>
For you, I'll scrub your back and I'll soap the butt-crack<br/>
Make you shiny, spiffy in a jiff<br/>
Fuckin with the Ab, you got the greatest of gifts<br/>
Yo, my mic is sounding bug. Bob Power, you there?(Yeah)<br/>
Adjust the bass and treble make my shit sound clear(echo)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x8:]</i><br/>
(Q-Tip: After fourth time)<br/>
Make you shiny, spiffy in a jiff<br/>
Fuckin with the Ab, you got the greatest of gifts<br/>
A-yo, my mic is sounding bug. Bob Power, you there?<br/>
Adjust the bass and treble...OK, could you come in Tip?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Whoop, back yourself man. Come watch me drop it<br/>
For showing me I could do it, for showing me I can rock it<br/>
Me not deal wit no changaram, bangaram business<br/>
I got soul on a hymn, like Jehovah's got the witness<br/>
Musically, the three, poetically, be me<br/>
We in jammin on the airwaves, kids just rave<br/>
Obey the MCs, cuz the MCs say<br/>
We flippin more niggaz like we Super Dave<br/>
But noticin my stature, y'all niggaz know we gotcha<br/>
Movin to the rapture, listen how we catch ya<br/>
Movin with the grace, here we go, let's begin<br/>
Makin people jump out their goddamn skin<br/>
Lyrically, we bite like we Rin Tin Tin<br/>
Peace to Grand Pu and his many, many skins<br/>
Don't mark with the arrow, cuz we know we get the wins<br/>
It's the Ab, Shaheed, and the Dawg for the blend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus until end:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
I wanna say peace to my man Rob P, my man Jerod, and <br/>
Skeff Anslem on the help  out and we out like shout<br/>
Nine-tre, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...<br/>
I don't wanna say nine-tre<br/>
cause my man Extra P said don't say the years<br/>
So, it's for eternity, know what I'm sayin?<br/>
Rock rock on, everybody in Queens, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody in Brooklyn, rock rock on<br/>
Money Earnin Mt. Vernon, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody in Jersey, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody in Philly rock rock on<br/>
Everybody in Houston, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody LA, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody in The Sand, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody in Egypt, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody Nigeria, rock rock on <br/>
Everybody in London, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody in Sweden, rock rock on <br/>
Everybody in beware, rock rock on<br/>
To the niggaz on the famous, rock rock on<br/>
Everybody no name, rock rock on<br/>
To the kids at Nu-Clear, rock rock on<br/>
The Cave rock rock on. McDonald's, rock rock on
