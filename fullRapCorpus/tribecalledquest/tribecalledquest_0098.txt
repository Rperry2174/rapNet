Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm<br/>
<br/>
So am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?<br/>
Just another dummy caught up in the system<br/>
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford<br/>
Versus gettin' that degree at Stanford or Harvard<br/>
And by my work ethic, the way I speak<br/>
Yo, should it be mentally weak versus bein' Malik<br/>
Yo, should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?<br/>
Fourth grade mean level but he knows how to rap<br/>
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?<br/>
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?<br/>
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement<br/>
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement<br/>
<br/>
Melanin is shrouded in complexity<br/>
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity<br/>
Mouth translate happens organically<br/>
The media relates to what it thinks it sees<br/>
Judging steps in shoes from a path they never walked<br/>
Shot down in a blaze over phrases, how they talk<br/>
Dark skin, walk with a bop, a trade feelin'<br/>
I'm chillin', feelin' down at a DNA crime buildin'<br/>
Supplement the youth, hypersexualizing women<br/>
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built a prison<br/>
Pumping false religion to all of these niggas' systems<br/>
Every voice devoid of the truth<br/>
Come on, listen<br/>
<br/>
Look at this, look at this<br/>
Whatever will be will be<br/>
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams<br/>
Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killas capture<br/>
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way<br/>
The rarity is in the rear, but never today<br/>
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play<br/>
On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz<br/>
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs<br/>
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz<br/>
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind<br/>
Yes, the government will for learning is feed for everyone<br/>
And from that lie, your leaders will rise in the eyes<br/>
Of despair and adversity in some universal sense will be true<br/>
<br/>
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'<br/>
But whatever's gonna be will be<br/>
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'<br/>
But whatever's gonna be will be<br/>
Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl<br/>
And the weakest amongst them, they will fall<br/>
But the strongest in fate, they will stand tall<br/>
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'<br/>
But whatever's gonna be will be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia<br/>
'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia<br/>
'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria<br/>
Let's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia<br/>
Green and the white, we servin' that Nigeria<br/>
North side of Queens, one-nine-two is the area<br/>
This is for my dawgs from Shih Tzus to Terriers<br/>
Fuck it, it's showtime, Tip, make sure they hearin' ya
