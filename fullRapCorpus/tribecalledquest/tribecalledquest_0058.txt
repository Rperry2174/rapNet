<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now you caught me heart for the evening<br/>
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things<br/>
Should I just sit out or come harder?<br/>
Help me find my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Messing me up, my whole head<br/>
Teasing me, just like Tisha, did Martin<br/>
Now look at what you're starting<br/>
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush<br/>
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)<br/>
My peoples they complain, sitt and rave and rant (come on)<br/>
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)<br/>
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Speaking of which, got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss (come on)<br/>
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (what?)<br/>
End of the day you're not mad at me (uh)<br/>
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me (what?)<br/>
I said: "hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly" (come on)<br/>
'Cause yo, picture me messing it up<br/>
Her mind not corrupt with the ill C-Cups<br/>
Shit, I'm on my J.O. (come on)<br/>
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow (what?)<br/>
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though<br/>
Is kisses when we greet, tell me what's the dill yo? (dill yo, yo, yo...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?<br/>
Making things for me towards you harder<br/>
Killing me, just when I think we're there<br/>
You got the whole vibe and the flows in the air<br/>
Telling me 'bout next man<br/>
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan<br/>
Who got your heart in mind?<br/>
It's about time that you just unwind (come on)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
And let it just happen, make it front-free (uh)<br/>
Just sweat me like Moneypenny (uh)<br/>
Digging you, getting inside of your stee (what?)<br/>
It's the Quest that keeping you company<br/>
Forever, or however you want it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Word word, now wait a minute now before you jet it to the curb (yeah, yeah)<br/>
Start to make affections, which is good not the hurt<br/>
But it, it aint me, and I, I ain't blurred (uh)<br/>
I'ma still just chill with you<br/>
Maybe things could change if you change your view (come on)<br/>
If not then I guess it is cool (yeah)<br/>
just, to keep to yourself and adbide by the rules, right<br/>
<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
like that now...<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
wha wha now...<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
yeah yeah now...<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
it's like that now...<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
yeah yeah now...<br/>
check it out now...<br/>
what you say, what? what?<br/>
<br/>
