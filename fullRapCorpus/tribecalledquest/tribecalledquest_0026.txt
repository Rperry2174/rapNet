<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Babies babble on, they lookin for excuses<br/>
Game for the buzzer who kicked it to the losers<br/>
Lame as a brain, could be, golly gee<br/>
If you see a shrink he'll charge you a fee<br/>
If you see me ya see the fee is nothing<br/>
Fee will be for patience all that's no fronting<br/>

What's Alex Haley if it doesn't have roots?<br/>
What's a weekend if you ain't knockin boots?<br/>
What's a black nation, without black unity?<br/>
What is a child who doesn't know pubery?<br/>
What is my label when I exit boom status?<br/>
What's menage-a-tois, or, that is<br/>
What is sex when you have three people?<br/>
What are laws if they ain't fair and equal?<br/>
What's Clark Kent without a telephone booth?<br/>
What is a liquor if it ain't 80 proof?<br/>
