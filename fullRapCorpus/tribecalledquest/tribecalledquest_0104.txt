<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills<br/>
Dream about Bugattis and other four-wheels<br/>
They say Illuminati and other ordeals<br/>
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal<br/>
And now it's more real than it is for any other star<br/>
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar<br/>
I should probably get awards when the Emmys are<br/>
For how I deal with the path like Remy Ma<br/>
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now<br/>
But don't confuse how you see me, have to move now<br/>
I got bars like the cypher's in the booth now<br/>
Ooo, child, things are gonna get easier<br/>
'Long as they get my page right on Wikipedia<br/>
'Long as they say my name right in the media<br/>
If you don't, that's a sin like Cincinnati<br/>
'Cause ever since I had the polo suit at the Grammys<br/>
I been spittin' at the camera like Trick Daddy<br/>
So swag, he could have broke up with IG<br/>
I ain't surprised that they broke up on IG<br/>
I got the game on IV<br/>
Might as well have a live feed<br/>
Keep a fresh cut from Aunt B<br/>
So I always match the picture in my ID<br/>
They packin' Dub C and run with MAC 10<br/>
I was still a baby Similac then<br/>
And what the crack era did to black men<br/>
It had to be an error if you had a Cadillac then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
How I rock mine, I throw it up<br/>
Makin' sure that you niggas all are on the same page<br/>
Powerful force, you better look both ways<br/>
Fuck that, I'm chokin' niggas, it's goin' down<br/>
I'm from a different cloth, we the oracles of the sound<br/>
Skip town, hit 'em with impeccable pound<br/>
Lost, found, the way I flood it, niggas gon' drown<br/>
Rip shit...oh, wait, wait, wait, wait...<br/>
I gotta do it again, I gotta do it again<br/>
You already know the script, roundhouse kick<br/>
She lookin' at me, lickin' her lip<br/>
Put my arm around her like a bowl of chip with the dip<br/>
With your bitch, what the fuck, niggas erupt<br/>
I got the half moon clip, that's banana, a good planner<br/>
A new anger like a larger Bruce Banner, out the house<br/>
Nigga, if you open your mouth<br/>
Damn, nigga, if you open you mouth<br/>
Fuck the press, I'm leavin' every room in a mess<br/>
Like herds of bulls with they aprons on and bakin' soda<br/>
Keep it movin', keep the convo short and bring a case of Henny<br/>
House of Pain, I control many<br/>
House of lies, where niggas go run, hide<br/>
Peep the way the scribe conflict with they real lives<br/>
(Nigga) Phonetic shit, we go bizarre<br/>
Bad news for niggas as I go emphatical, radical<br/>
Mention no animals, roamin' like a czar<br/>
Every time I blah for the record, the shit splatter<br/>
The whole data, no bullshit, the boom bapper<br/>
I pull the gat up, whip the ship, come to bat up<br/>
When I pull up too niggas even your momma goin' scatter
