<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tammy Lucas]</i><br/>
Ohhhh, you did it to me 1nce Again my friend<br/>
I swear you do it to me everytime<br/>
Cause you stay crazy on my mind<br/>
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on<br/>
On and on and on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Phife Dawg, Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
This is the year that I come in and just devestate<br/>
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?<br/>
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection<br/>
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your rear section<br/>
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight<br/>
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight<br/>
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block<br/>
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock<br/>
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test<br/>
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your friggin chest<br/>
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop<br/>
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops<br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo I gotta put some action on paper<br/>
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper<br/>
The only tip I got for a waiter<br/>
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda bit me<br/>
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought<br/>
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil<br/>
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble<br/>
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel<br/>
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?<br/>
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts<br/>
You know a fellas good for the moola<br/>
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Q-Tip, Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints<br/>
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points<br/>
But I can break a fella down like sex<br/>
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex<br/>
If one nigga front I'ma make more pay<br/>
Cause toniiiiight, we gettin off like O.J.<br/>
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking<br/>
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and<br/>
<br/>
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two<br/>
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do<br/>
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet<br/>
But if they huddle, and word, then this is good as set<br/>
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible<br/>
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable<br/>
As for me see I just do how I love to do<br/>
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you<br/>
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along<br/>
The friggin fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games<br/>
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul<br/>
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll<br/>
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose<br/>
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin dues<br/>
So hear me out one time, you gots ta be yourself<br/>
Cuz if you ain't yourself you end up by your friggin self<br/>
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang<br/>
And yo we'll see who can hang yo<br/>
<br/>
You on point Tip?<br/>
Yo 1nce Again Phife<br/>
You on point Tip?<br/>
Yo 1nce Again Phife<br/>
You on point Tip?<br/>
Yo 1nce again Phife<br/>
Aiyyo that kid is hard!<br/>
<br/>
