<i>[Chorus scratching:]</i><br/>
Clap your hands now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Brothas know the flavs when the Quest gets loose<br/>
Slammin sucka fuckas like the wrestler Zeus<br/>
Crazier than Tupac in that flick called Juice<br/>
Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss<br/>
Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Deuce<br/>
Gets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke<br/>
Control the mic like Denzel on the girls<br/>
Wack MCs be on the nuts like Rocket J. Squirrel<br/>
The worst thing in the world is a sucka MC<br/>
Favorite rap group in the world is EPMD<br/>
Can't forget the De La, the two originality<br/>
And if I ever went solo, my favorite MC would be me<br/>
Phife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy<br/>
Peace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies<br/>
Like um, Ralph up to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger<br/>
Laverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger<br/>
Ren to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy<br/>
Q-Tip and Phifer, they mashed up the party<br/>
Kick the rhymes and more rhymes<br/>
Kick the beats and more beats<br/>
We'll have you scratchin in your head, like trying all techniques<br/>
For those who wanna oppose, just take a stand<br/>
But for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
You just wanna dance man, then clap your hands<br/>
If you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance...<br/>
Will be crucial, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you<br/>
So listen<br/>
The Abstract intuition is very very worthy<br/>
I can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey<br/>
Can't understand, the underground, it gets deep<br/>
The low, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps<br/>
The women, the lingo and all the other goods<br/>
Peace to the hoods, that keep my shit on play<br/>
Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke<br/>
Brothas know my angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner<br/>
Hook up the beats at the funk manner<br/>
If want a roll, then dough I be rakin<br/>
The scope is on the world, cuz it's mine for the takin<br/>
You know I'm gonna do it<br/>
My shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid<br/>
Chemists get confused of my ill composition<br/>
This is the third of the new Tribe addition<br/>
MCs be swingin, but alot of them be missin<br/>
So shut your bloodclot and listen <br/>
Cuz I'm bringin you the ill rendition<br/>
I'd like to send this out to the L.E.S.<br/>
Gotta alot of rhythm and style and finesse<br/>
Come here love, hot sex on a plat<br/>
And when your done with that then clap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus until end]</i>
