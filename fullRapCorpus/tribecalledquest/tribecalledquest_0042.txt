<i>[Intro: Kamaal (Q-Tip)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Phony rappers who do not write<br/>
Phony rappers who do not excite<br/>
Phony rappers, check it out, aight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Kamaal (Q-Tip)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo, I was riding the train<br/>
And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain<br/>
Let's battle<br/>
It kinda took me by surprised<br/>
Cuz the brother was moving wit his eyes on the prize<br/>
I said screw it, I ain't got nuttin to lose but um<br/>
But I got to do this shit real quick so um<br/>
Hurry up kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine<br/>
And I be out cuz I got to see this hottie, he said ok<br/>
Now check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's what he said<br/>
Then I came back and just fucked up his head<br/>
Cuz yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV<br/>
Couldn't hold the shit down in New York City<br/>
Aiyyo, I showed his ass, then I went off on my task<br/>
To bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down<br/>
Yea, yea, sonny, to the beat like that<br/>
You wanna bring it to me, where you at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yes, dread, I had a similiar situation<br/>
When this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation<br/>
He said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall<br/>
I looked him up and down, grab my crotch and said balls<br/>
Of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip<br/>
Ay, you know me, you know I had to come out my shit<br/>
Trying to lounge at the mall, meet Skef and Mr Walton<br/>
Finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault<br/>
He said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickelbags of weed<br/>
That's when I preceeded to give him what he needed<br/>
Talking 'bout I need a Phillie right before I get loose<br/>
Poor excuse, money please, i get loose off of orange juice<br/>
Preferly Minute Maid cuz that's exactly what it takes<br/>
To write a rhyme, huh, to school your nickels and your dimes<br/>
Because an MC like me be on TV<br/>
Don't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC<br/>
<br/>
Phony rappers who do not write<br/>
Phony rappers who do not excite<br/>
Phony rappers, you know they type<br/>
Phony rappers, check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Phife, Consequence]</i><br/>
<br/>
It seems there's a sanitation, y'all full of thrash talker<br/>
Sounding good but money can you feed the dog hawker<br/>
Talking 'bout your mic days and your breakdancing<br/>
Not enhancing, you sound tired<br/>
Oh, shit, I didn't know you like to play yourself in front'cha friends<br/>
Sitting there, lying to no end<br/>
MC's for me make things happening<br/>
Talk about a world but in a form of rapping<br/>
Who will be the captain of this ship<br/>
If it goes down, don't you know you have to go wit it<br/>
Just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks<br/>
Doesn't mean that you've reach the MC's peak<br/>
Let me stop sounding all bitter<br/>
Ghetto child, never be a quitter<br/>
But don't be a phony in the litter<br/>
Take it as a letter from the better<br/>
Take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass jetta's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[C:]</i> Yo, Phife, you need a condom<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> Word to God, mess around<br/>
I catch Aids from Mc's being on my nuts too hard<br/>
<i>[C:]</i> Cuz on my blvd you better bring your bodyguard<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> And what's your blvd<br/>
<i>[C:]</i> LP, I represent naturally<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> So don't step on the rolly if you know that you're phony<br/>
Or else I bend that ass like elbow macaroni<br/>
Cuz I gotta keep it real (gotta keep it real)<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest, you see we never half step<br/>
<i>[C:]</i> (So on your mark) get ready, MC's be jetti<br/>
Me and Phifey be on ya like Veronica and Betty<br/>
Archie, Jughead, snuffing Mc's<br/>
From Brainslane down  to Hempstead<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> Yes 'Quence, see over<br/>
His rhyme style is older that a Chrysler car Nova<br/>
I'm wilder then the cats from Arizona<br/>
Villanova, un, un, Kentucky<br/>
Whos' the next MC stepping up to try and bust me<br/>
Bring him here and boy, will I ever let him have it<br/>
<i>[C:]</i> And when it comes to the microphone, don't even try to grab it<br/>
What?
