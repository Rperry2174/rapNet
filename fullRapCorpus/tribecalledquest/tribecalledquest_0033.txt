<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
The night is my mind<br/>
The sun'll still shine<br/>
But the night is on my mind<br/>
So parlay while I drop this rhyme<br/>
<br/>
See, Jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark<br/>
They be comin out the heads, but shit don't let me start<br/>
Their activities are plenty in nighttime(nighttime)<br/>
For the ghetto child, it seems to be the right time<br/>
See, kids be gettin stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks<br/>
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic<br/>
Runnin to the corner, the dice game is blazin<br/>
Lookin at the loot, it seems so amazin<br/>
Puts it short down, to be exact would bound<br/>
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down(uh!)<br/>
Scam money don't make none<br/>
He threw a trip on the ace, now he's out son<br/>
Hits the local bodega to woof down a hero<br/>
Son is on a 'Midnight Run' like De Niro<br/>
Spots the shorty rock standin on his block<br/>
The thieves be handlin in the pumps,so he asked it it's not<br/>
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one<br/>
Increased intensity, his dance sure was a fly one<br/>
Took her to the crib there she ran her gibs<br/>
About mind upliftment and bein positive<br/>
He yawned and he sighed til 1:05<br/>
Then he finally realized that hunny wasn't live<br/>
At least he didn't plan on buildin for the evenin'<br/>
Threw the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leavin'<br/>
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him<br/>
Saw his man Sam with the blunt in his hand<br/>
(Aww Shhh...!!!)You know the transaction<br/>
Brothas gettin lost in the weed satisfaction<br/>
Comin down the block man loud as (fuck)<br/>
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk <br/>
As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt<br/>
They interrupt ya cipher, and crush ya blunt<br/>
See you left your work at home, so they pat you down for nuthin<br/>
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep frontin?<br/>
You push to the park, even though it's still dark<br/>
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot ya troop'<br/>
<br/>
The night is on my mind <br/>
The sun'll still shine <br/>
But now the night is on my mind, the night is on the mind<br/>
The night is on your mind <br/>
A yo, the sun'll still shine<br/>
But now the night is on the mind<br/>
As for me...<br/>
<br/>
I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates<br/>
On a young black man, who makes the niggaz speak a shake<br/>
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy<br/>
It's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound<br/>
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it<br/>
The night makes the aura and the J can't hack it<br/>
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky<br/>
And the stars dance around, a yo, I think it's fly<br/>
Intensity, most rappers don't see it<br/>
Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it<br/>
Serenity and sirens of the sounds and emotions<br/>
In the concrete jungle and the sun don't bungle<br/>
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel<br/>
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel<br/>
But let me slow down, I think I ran my gibs enough<br/>
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough<br/>
<br/>
The night is on my mind, the sun'll still shine<br/>
The night is on my mind, the night is on my mind<br/>
The night is on my mind, yeah, the sun'll still shine<br/>
But now, uh huh, the night is on my mind<br/>
The night is on your mind, you know the sun'll still shine<br/>
But now the night is on the mind, yeah, the night is on my mind<br/>
The night is on the mind, a yo, the sun'll still shine<br/>
But now the night is on the mind, yeah, the night is on the mind<br/>
The night is on the mind, a yo, the sun'll still shine
