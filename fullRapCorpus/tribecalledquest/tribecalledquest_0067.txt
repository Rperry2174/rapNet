<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo<br/>
Knew a girl named Shelley<br/>
Six-pack belly<br/>
When we made love she made it shake like jelly<br/>
Put her own video star on my tele<br/>
Lived in the Bronx on the block named Fortelly<br/>
Had to be jetty cause this sucker hold netty<br/>
Kept blowing me up, her jonesing was steady<br/>
Told my man Louie that I really wasn't ready<br/>
Louie when we did it, man, we both got sweaty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
This girl from my past<br/>
Had ridiculous ass<br/>
She attended UMASS and she passed every class<br/>
Walked down the hall with her stuffed up sass<br/>
Told the basketball players, she liked how they pass<br/>
But when I use to hit it<br/>
The ball cat, she quit it<br/>
She wouldn't ad-mit it<br/>
But shorty was addicted<br/>
(Say Word) Word, Nigga you heard<br/>
Like a fiend with a queen when he catches the bird<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Knowing how we living I'ma talk about Mayo<br/>
?Sagartery and mommy? Her love was a KO<br/>
We was on the under, had to stay on the lay low<br/>
Use to go so deep, she had to say Aiyyo<br/>
Rock with her friend, but her friend drove both way<br/>
Asked her about it and she used to say No way<br/>
Just let it go yo, I used to say OK<br/>
Just another day but fight anyway<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
I put it down man, whatcha gonna do<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
Well hell, I put it down son, whatcha gonna do<br/>
<i>[Together]</i><br/>
We put it down for the area crew<br/>
All the shortys that smoking y'all whoo<br/>
Looking good it you sipping on your brew<br/>
Come here ma, we make it hot for you<br/>
Come here ma, we make it hot for you<br/>
Come here ma, we make it hot for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Met a shorty named Kenny<br/>
From East Saint Louie<br/>
Body good and plenty<br/>
The finest in Missouri<br/>
If you had no money, you better hit the highway<br/>
Even in her own right, she had to do it her way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
It was an ill situation when I met Dantanya<br/>
Worked in Saint Louis, in her mother's hair parlor<br/>
Use to hit her man for cake to come see me<br/>
Her and her man from home, they sold heemey<br/>
We had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit<br/>
When I thugged it yo, she said I was the ultimate<br/>
Broke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner<br/>
All of things they did not concern her<br/>
People that we love yo, we love for a passion<br/>
I'ma type of cat that brings forth the action<br/>
You feeling me yo?<br/>
I hope you hearing me yo<br/>
One more thing before you start cheering me yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
I put it down Phife, what we gonna do<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
Well hell, I put it down son, whatcha gonna do<br/>
<i>[Together]</i><br/>
We put it down for the area crew<br/>
All the shortys that smoking y'all whoo<br/>
Looking good it you sipping on your brew<br/>
Come here ma, we make it hot for you <i>[repeat till end]</i>
