We don't believe you 'cause we the people<br/>
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you<br/>
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood<br/>
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food<br/>
The ramen noodle<br/>
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju<br/>
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap<br/>
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that<br/>
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back<br/>
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that<br/>
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with<br/>
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with<br/>
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality<br/>
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically<br/>
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas<br/>
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas<br/>
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl<br/>
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole<br/>
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold<br/>
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay<br/>
<br/>
All you Black folks, you must go<br/>
All you Mexicans, you must go<br/>
And all you poor folks, you must go<br/>
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways<br/>
So all you bad folks, you must go<br/>
<br/>
The fog and the smog of news media that logs<br/>
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds<br/>
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars<br/>
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars<br/>
<br/>
You bastards overlooking street art<br/>
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts<br/>
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians<br/>
Fuck y'all know about true competition?<br/>
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'<br/>
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'<br/>
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten<br/>
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division<br/>
Boy, I tell you that's vision<br/>
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten<br/>
The Tribe be the best in they division<br/>
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision<br/>
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?<br/>
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block<br/>
Babylon, bloodclot<br/>
Two pon yuh headtop<br/>
<br/>
All you Black folks, you must go<br/>
All you Mexicans, you must go<br/>
And all you poor folks, you must go<br/>
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways<br/>
So all you bad folks, you must go
