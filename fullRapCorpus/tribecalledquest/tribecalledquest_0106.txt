<i>[Talib Kweli:]</i><br/>
Winter in America, never knew white Christmas<br/>
'Cause elves said the squares is always making my shit list<br/>
Spring is in the air and all the flowers in bloom<br/>
The powers that be wanna devour the movement<br/>
Tears disappear when they fall in the summer rain<br/>
Bleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment<br/>
Running across stages is a drug<br/>
It's like a blunt that we crumple in raw papers<br/>
Call it the Lord's name cause we taking it in our veins<br/>
Like the feeding us intravenous<br/>
It's war and we fighting for inches and millimetres<br/>
Try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders<br/>
If we don't give them martyrs no more, they can't defeat us<br/>
This lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces<br/>
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training<br/>
The force flags fly at a half mast this morning<br/>
Take a bow, this might be your last performance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
The old lady saw us on the lawn with the Henny<br/>
Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney<br/>
Might've been racist like the waitresses up at Denny's<br/>
So we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis<br/>
Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech<br/>
'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech<br/>
Presidents get impeached and others fill in the throne<br/>
But veterans don't get the benefit of feelin' at home<br/>
So maybe those projections out at Silicon<br/>
Over dro they getting injections made of silicone<br/>
I swear it's the killing season<br/>
'Cause killin' is still in season yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jarobi:]</i><br/>
Louder than a three pound, voices screaming at ya boo<br/>
It must be killing season, on the menu, strange fruit<br/>
Whose juices fill the progress of this here, very nation<br/>
Whose states has grown bitter, through justice expiration<br/>
These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment<br/>
Things haven't really changed, been dormant for the moment<br/>
Marks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin<br/>
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within<br/>
Been on the wrong team so much, can't recognise a win<br/>
Seems like my only crime is having melanin<br/>
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for<br/>
Causes meant to suffocate, I can't breathe no more<br/>
Settle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally<br/>
Through all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize them sadly<br/>
Black soul old enough, inner city holdin' up<br/>
Watch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya <i>[x8]</i>
