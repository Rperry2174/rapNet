Classic, classic...<br/>
Classic example of a...a date rape <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Listen to the rhyme, it's a black date fact<br/>
Percentile rate of date rape is fat<br/>
This is all true to the reason of the skeezin<br/>
You got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season<br/>
If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break<br/>
Especially if a squad tries to cry out rape<br/>
You be all vexed cuz she got it goin on <br/>
You don't wanna fight cuz you know that you're wrong<br/>
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch<br/>
Envision in your head of a great sex bout<br/>
Worthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it<br/>
You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick<br/>
This is the case, the situation is sticky<br/>
Should you try to kiss or head for a hickey<br/>
Not even, you can ask Steven<br/>
If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin<br/>
Hit the road Jack and all of that<br/>
But if she offers her abode, to drop ya load<br/>
Right smack dab in the middle<br/>
Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Uh huh, you know science, you get buckwild<br/>
Runnin mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles<br/>
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone<br/>
Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone<br/>
If she tries to front, then you start to dis her<br/>
If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her<br/>
Might as well get to the point, no time to waste<br/>
Might as well break the ice, then set the pace<br/>
You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone<br/>
Step out of the shower, throw on cologne<br/>
All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho<br/>
She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego<br/>
You listen to After 7, break fool after 10<br/>
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again<br/>
There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two<br/>
Now tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do<br/>
What do you know, when the meow is completed<br/>
Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Sweetheart, we ain't goin out like that <i>[2X]</i><br/>
Sweetheart, we ain't goin out like that(zulu)<br/>
We ain't goin out like that(zulu)<br/>
We ain't goin out like that<br/>
<br/>
Now baby bust it, if you wanna groove<br/>
Me and you can do it, it will be the move<br/>
I won't cry over spilled milk<br/>
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt<br/>
I don't wanna bone you that much<br/>
That I would go for the unforbidden touch<br/>
I'm not the type that would go for that<br/>
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat<br/>
Baby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude<br/>
I know because of your bloody attitude<br/>
I know why you act that way<br/>
It usually happens on the 28th day<br/>
I respect that crazily<br/>
When you're done with the past can you come check me<br/>
This ain't a joint to disrespect you<br/>
Because one head ain't better than two <br/>
Check it out<br/>
<br/>
It's a classic example of a...a date...
