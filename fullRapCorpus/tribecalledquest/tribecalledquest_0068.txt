<i>[Intro: Phife and Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Back at you, <br/>
Right back at you,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Tip and Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Drove around the block, <br/>
Drove a lot,<br/>
Lookin' all around,<br/>
Don't see no cops,<br/>
Whispered in your ear, a ghetto star,<br/>
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car,<br/>
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste,<br/>
Taste yours too, rub your back,<br/>
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat,<br/>
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes,<br/>
Close your legs, I start to sigh,<br/>
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes,<br/>
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like,<br/>
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head,<br/>
Put the thought away think of you instead,<br/>
Hot outside, it's hot in here,<br/>
Roll down the window the breeze in your hair,<br/>
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll,<br/>
You say you want me but did you want them all??,<br/>
Make me feel special, I know that you can,<br/>
Make me feel special like a prominent man,<br/>
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real,<br/>
Another brotha's fan? Forget how he feel/<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Tip and Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Me and you girl go against the world,<br/>
Against the world?,<br/>
<i>[Female voice]</i> Hell yeah the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Female voice]</i> <i>[Repeat 3x]</i><br/>
Yeah the world,<br/>
Yeah the world,<br/>
Yeah the world,<br/>
Whole wide world,<br/>
Yeah the world,<br/>
Yeah the world,<br/>
Yeah the world,<br/>
Whole wide world,<br/>
Yeah the world,<br/>
Yeah the world/<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tip and Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Zonin' undress ya???Still hold play???<br/>
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way,<br/>
If we was on video I'd press rewind,<br/>
A nigga think about you all the time,<br/>
Pidgeon dropped a note on top my head,<br/>
R&amp;B,pop girl's a thoroughbred,<br/>
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...<i>[Pause]</i><br/>
Pick you up,<br/>
Raise your cups,<br/>
Let's double up,<br/>
Bomb came known, natural disas,<br/>
Fall in love with me? huh, well that's that ass,<br/>
Wanna get you, inside my world,<br/>
Process, straight, afro or curl,<br/>
Stretch me out, fade me in,<br/>
Forever you in need let me see you grin?<br/>
He bust with you, I'm a tap his chin??<br/>
Make me feel special, I know that you can,<br/>
Make me feel special like a prominent man,<br/>
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real,<br/>
Another brotha's fan? forget he feel/<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
