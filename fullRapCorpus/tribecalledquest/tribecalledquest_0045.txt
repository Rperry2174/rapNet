<i>[Girls talking on phone]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
It was Friday afternoon in the middle of June<br/>
Heineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom<br/>
Around the time everybody had just got home from class<br/>
Shootin dice, talkin shit, hopin the cash would last<br/>
Yo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better<br/>
Juney moved around in a tinted out Jetta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke<br/>
Then I took one toke, yo, I almost choked<br/>
See I never smoked before and my nerves got shot<br/>
Then he told me about the party at the spot jam rock<br/>
It was guaranteed on but I said "son, chill"<br/>
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real<br/>
Word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
He said we got no Js, so we gonna do it right<br/>
Hit your man's joint first, then jam rock at one night<br/>
Then I said "aight", then I jumped inside the jetty<br/>
Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready<br/>
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady<br/>
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty<br/>
I went upstairs to get fly, broke my tie<br/>
On some liquor, to meet my high quicker<br/>
Now, I'm tight, them know, the party is the M.O.<br/>
Me and my crew, we get it started like a demo<br/>
Eleven in the evenin, I'm feelin like a heathen<br/>
This thing is goin down and I highly doubt I'm leavin<br/>
Booty cheeks start to motion and the kids is drinkin potion<br/>
Word is bond, that Black Moon joint got me open<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
A yo, the DJ put this short groove on<br/>
The good shit that makes a kid lose his drink<br/>
Blendin Risin to the Top and got these shorties hoppin<br/>
Nuthin but coppin, ain't no stoppin me now<br/>
Yo, I'm bound to win until that thing kicked in<br/>
The Alazay had me drunk, I don't know where to begin(echoed)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Not I'm feelin kinda jaded, wildly coherent<br/>
Me and the fellas acted very irreverent<br/>
Butt grabbin, mad laughin and assin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
When that chick caught up, the shorty lookin fed up<br/>
They say you drug one with this one, gibbin with that one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
A yo, I'm just doin my thing, yo I'm just havin fun<br/>
You don't see me in here wylin pullin out no gun<br/>
Yo, I see some of that thing girl and I want some<br/>
So let's step inside this corner so that we can rap on<br/>
Over this bumpin ass song and some Dom Perignon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
I hit ya with the good lovin plus fillet mignon<br/>
(Yeah, yeah scrammy scrams, yo, that's that same old song)<br/>
(A yo, tell me why the hell your breath smells so strong)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
Yo, put some brakes on your yappin or you won't live long<br/>
(Please nigga, push on)<br/>
Alright scrams, see you later (scrams)<br/>
Can't mess with these street sharks or these alligators<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
I can't take it no more, yo it's damn near four<br/>
I've been partyin and drinkin since I came out my door<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip (Consequence)]</i><br/>
Look at these kids about to mix it, damn, where's the exit?<br/>
(Son, jetted to the ride and got the burner out the Lexus)<br/>
Yo, he cocked his joint back like he's about to let him have it<br/>
(Kid, I kept it movin like the Energizer rabbit)<br/>
A yo yo, it's time to skate, ain't no time to contemplate<br/>
(<i>[all:]</i> Whoops, looka there, there's Jake)
