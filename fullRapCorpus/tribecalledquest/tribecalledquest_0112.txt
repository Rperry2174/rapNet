I pull more beeps than the beep at the premier of Pocohantas<br/>
Word is born, I am the baddest<br/>
And all you honies out there, word is born, you know my status<br/>
So come and pull your panties down<br/>
This ain't no Barnum and Bailey show, I don't get down wit the clowns<br/>
So why don't you and your friends, get wit me and my friends<br/>
But don't bring your ass buying you ain't got no ends<br/>
Word is born, it don't stop(stop,stop,stop...)<br/>
Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop<br/>
Come on everybody, do the hop<br/>
Even if you a cop, you gotta come back and do the hop<br/>
You move to the beat, you don't stop<br/>
You smoking jub rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop<br/>
Then you come back and do the hop<br/>
You know we don't stop, we on the ghetto, rise on the top<br/>
You know we come back and do the hop<br/>
Shorties in the place, all the shorty rocks, do the hop<br/>
You gotta come back and do the hop<br/>
We never go on pop, you know we come back, we do the hop<br/>
This is how it is, we do the hop
