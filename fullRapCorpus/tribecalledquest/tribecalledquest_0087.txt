<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ayo who wanna pull on Phifer long time no hear from<br/>
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some<br/>
But that pop is non cypher, no can do<br/>
And if you think I'm a dope, then ask the other crew<br/>
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow<br/>
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just step off with the hoe<br/>
Oops my mistake I didn't know you went with her<br/>
Should I run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her<br/>
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter<br/>
I heard she likes to do one-one my man John Ritter<br/>
But back to the subject you can't catch wreck<br/>
You must get respect, to earn respect<br/>
Suckers think they could herb me cuz know I where specks<br/>
You're full of jokes, but you your name ain't flex<br/>
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable<br/>
You think you're all that but you're girl's quite doable<br/>
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me<br/>
I'm not a mad cohort, but I'm not Mr. Softee<br/>
Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart<br/>
So forget the chart because the action can start<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Where ya at?  To all my peoples with the funk<br/>
I'm the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk<br/>
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers<br/>
Niggaz step up it's the lyrical worker<br/>
The poems that I create ain't in paper back books<br/>
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks<br/>
My mental is excelling cuz I dabble in the books<br/>
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops<br/>
Yo I gets the pickens, I'm such a damn Dickens<br/>
If you step to this then the plot just thickens<br/>
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog<br/>
To me, your just another MC on the log<br/>
A link on the chain, fluid on the brain<br/>
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mardane<br/>
See I can't maintain, especially if you come back<br/>
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah I can do that<br/>
I can also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home<br/>
Cuz when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones<br/>
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind<br/>
Makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop a rhyme<br/>
My title is locked, the Abstract poetic<br/>
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic<br/>
So smooth and debonair, especially for the ear<br/>
Gotta keep my thing in gear cuz it's evident and clear<br/>
That I will rock, rock, rock <i>[fades away]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
