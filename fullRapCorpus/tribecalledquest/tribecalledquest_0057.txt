<i>[quiet eerie voice]</i> Yooooo....Yooooo...I hope ya'll ready...<br/>
Are ya ready?  Here we go....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
What ya deal with...uhhh...<br/>
What ya deal wit'...what ya deal wit'...<br/>
Turn me up some more?<br/>
<br/>
Incognito, speakin' to ya<br/>
Feel this, have it, makin' music<br/>
Men and women, boys an' girls an'<br/>
Welcome to the movement, the fifth wit' improvement<br/>
Aristotle, Plato, Freud<br/>
Yeah right, Abstract, never void<br/>
I make it easy for ya'll to boogie down to<br/>
Hard to the ground, ooh the Tribe with the sound boo<br/>
Touch me, tease me, feed me, squeezy<br/>
Take it easy, never sleazy<br/>
Promise that I will not answer<br/>
The phone when it rings love, while we do out thing love<br/>
Never fakin', it's late, spirits<br/>
Through the music is our mission<br/>
Honies who were not cooler than the ghetto rebel risin'<br/>
To overthrow a ruler<br/>
Dearly beloved, dearly departed<br/>
There's a reason why we did it<br/>
Cuz it's inside the body and the hearts<br/>
So here we are fam let's start, c'mon...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Don't beat me in the head with the bullsh*t bat<br/>
C'mon everybody let's start <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ummah, Mos, Jane Doe, Willy<br/>
Punchline, Wordsworth, SV, Chrissy<br/>
S.O.S., Tribe Called Quest<br/>
Get it off your chest, say it: "Tribe Called Quest!"<br/>
Can you feel it when it hit right<br/>
Can you feel it when we do it<br/>
Truth, power, taste, devour<br/>
Niggaz in the street here comes the illest beat now<br/>
Move oceans wit' your mental<br/>
Think it, do it, be it, embellish<br/>
Here's another point for everyone to relish<br/>
When Ski busts his tools all ya'll foes will embellish<br/>
For somethin' wicked at ya'll faces<br/>
What I see is longin', needin'<br/>
Hey I got you with that goooooood stuff<br/>
And ya probably won't get enough<br/>
Ay-yo, lyrics I got it, lyrics, cadence<br/>
Do it with fun and patience<br/>
Funky, rhythmic, characteristic<br/>
Ebonically lingustic wit' the ghetto futuristic<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head<br/>
Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head<br/>
Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head<br/>
Don't beat me in the head, head, head, head...<br/>
<br/>
So here we are fam let's start, so here we are fam let's start<br/>
So here we are fam let's start, so here we are fam let's start<br/>
To the Ummah family lets start<br/>
A-yo get off your ass and let's start, A-yo, here we are fam let's start<br/>
C'mon, get off your ass and let's start, here we are fam let's start<br/>
Here we is fam let's start, get off your ass and let's start<br/>
Here we are fam let's start, get off your aaaassss-ah-ah-ah-ah<br/>
Ha ha ha ha ha...let's start
