<i>[vocal interludes sampled from "Time is Running Out" by The Last Poets]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Back in the days when I was a teenager<br/>
Before I had status and before I had a pager<br/>
You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop<br/>
My pops used to say, it reminded him of be-bop<br/>
I said, well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles<br/>
The way that Bobby Brown is just ampin like Michael<br/>
Its all expected, things are for the lookin<br/>
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin<br/>
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly modes<br/>
Still got room on the truck, load the back boom<br/>
Listen to the rhyme, to get a mental picture<br/>
of this black man, through black woman victim<br/>
Why do I say that, cuz I gotta speak the truth man<br/>
Doing what we feel for the music is the proof and<br/>
Planted on the ground, the act is so together<br/>
Bonafied strong, you need leverage to sever<br/>
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is<br/>
deliberatley cheered LP filled with streeet goods<br/>
You can find it on the rack in your record store (store)<br/>
If you get the record, then your thoughts are adored <br/>
and appreciated, cause we're ever so glad we made it<br/>
We work hard, so we gotta thank God<br/>
Dishin out the plastic, do the dance till you spastic<br/>
If you dis... it gets drastic<br/>
Listen to the rhymes, cuz its time to make gravy<br/>
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby<br/>
All the way to Africa a.k.a. The Motherland (uh)<br/>
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand<br/>
That's the right hand, Black Man (man)<br/>
Only if you was noted as my man (man)<br/>
If I get the credit, then I'll think I deserve it <br/>
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it<br/>
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity<br/>
Cuz we gotta strive for longevity<br/>
If you botch up, what's in that (ass) (what?)<br/>
A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half (come on, come on)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
We gotta make moves<br/>
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on) <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Time.. time is a ship on a merciless sea<br/>
Drifting toward an average of nothingness<br/>
Until it can be retarded for it's own destiny<br/>
TIME is an inanimate object<br/>
Praying and praying and praying for ??<br/>
Time is DANCING, moving lingering all memories of past.."<br/>
The Last Poets<br/>
<br/>
You gotta be a winner all the time<br/>
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime<br/>
With the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks<br/>
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks<br/>
Musically the Quest, is on the rise<br/>
We on these Excursions so you must realize<br/>
that continually, I pop my Zulu<br/>
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip<br/>
So what could you do in the times which exist<br/>
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis<br/>
But if your sis is a (bitch), brother is a jerk<br/>
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work<br/>
Whatever it may be in today's society<br/>
Everything is fair, at least that how it seems to me<br/>
You must be honest and true to the next <br/>
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex<br/>
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen<br/>
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend<br/>
All it is, is the code of the streets <br/>
So listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats<br/>
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky<br/>
It could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie<br/>
What you gotta do to is know that the Tribe is in the sphere<br/>
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Edgar Allan Poe, it don't stop (uh!)<br/>
<br/>
"Time is running out on black power Africans today<br/>
and whites blacks and reporters at night<br/>
Everytime you see them ?? with their tongues hangin out<br/>
Time is running and past and passing and running<br/>
Running and past and passing and running (excursions)"
