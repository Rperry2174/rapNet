<i>[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Went to Carvel to get a milk shake<br/>
This honey ripped me off of my loot case<br/>
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket<br/>
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it<br/>
Yo tip I tell you man the devil's trying it<br/>
But I'm goin to stay strong cause I ain't bying it<br/>
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out<br/>
I don't have jack to wear<br/>
You know I've got to look dipped in the freshest gear<br/>
Cool I found something so I ironed it<br/>
I think I caught up on the phone<br/>
Oh shit I'm trying it<br/>
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?<br/>
I think I'll pull out my suit for Sunday service.<br/>
My little brother wants Barney, cool I'm getting it<br/>
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin it<br/>
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits<br/>
My blood pressure blowing up, I can't take this shit<br/>
Finally got what he wanted now he's good to go<br/>
Again the robers smashed, were's my radio?<br/>
One time the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...<br/>
They had no mercy on the car oh you he'll kill me<br/>
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm goin to smack her up<br/>
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up<br/>
I need to hit a hunny off yo drill pas me the phone<br/>
Pulled out my hooker hoes, oh yo Sheela's home<br/>
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm wrecked to bone<br/>
Went down on hun, she's in the red zone<br/>
Stressed out more than one could ever be<br/>
Forever trying to clear the sample for my new LP<br/>
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often<br/>
Got on a flight then I ended up in Boston<br/>
With all these trials and tribulations yo I've been affected<br/>
And to top it off, Starks got ejected<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Just last week my girl was stressing me<br/>
Now her best friend be underssing me<br/>
Well I was lovin her by the moon lit<br/>
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte'<br/>
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop<br/>
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops<br/>
Now I'm station bound for the thai sticks<br/>
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit<br/>
Coach sat me down from the ball team<br/>
Cause I was breakin niggaz on the inseams<br/>
Some niggas cross town was trying to stick me<br/>
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty<br/>
Picked up this gir in the hoopty<br/>
Just because of her rhymes she tried to soup me<br/>
Pay for this and pay for that loot for nails and hair<br/>
Who the hell do you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?<br/>
Go and get a bloddy job then can we look cute<br/>
Even if you get me boots, you'll neva see my loot<br/>
She wasn't even all of that just anothe hooker<br/>
Took the journey that ass way, quick like Chucky Booker<br/>
Sometimes you got put the hoes in their freakin place<br/>
Just move from in front me with your botty face!<br/>
<br/>
My man Mohammed in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
Zulu Nation in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
Sub Rock is in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
My man Skeff is in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
Jarobi White is in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
Bob Power in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
My man Eric in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
My man Lytcha in the house, huh {come on, come on}<br/>
(Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me... MUHAMMAD!)
