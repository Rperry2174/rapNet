<i>[Intro/Chorus: Faith Evans]</i><br/>
<br/>
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out<br/>
When you're face to face with your adversity<br/>
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out<br/>
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Consequence, Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game<br/>
(What's your name?) Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames<br/>
(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend <br/>
<br/>
Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream<br/>
Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember<br/>
Shatan got you caught in the storms of December<br/>
And brothers on the block packin nines like September<br/>
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender<br/>
<br/>
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new<br/>
I'm splurgin on these Reebok joints for shorty boo<br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin<br/>
Talkin out they joints but they wasn't sayin nuttin<br/>
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly<br/>
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up<br/>
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride<br/>
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies<br/>
<br/>
Yo we was at the dice game makin these cats look silly<br/>
Flamin, steady runnin off at the Willie<br/>
<br/>
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough<br/>
I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow<br/>
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'<br/>
Kept my eyeballs scopin for them pigs po-po<br/>
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'<br/>
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo<br/>
<br/>
And I was doin it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike<br/>
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite<br/>
<br/>
Yo I know the feelin, when you feelin like a villain<br/>
You be havin good thoughts but the evils be revealin<br/>
and the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)<br/>
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff<br/>
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past<br/>
all adversities, so we can get through fast, like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Consequence]</i><br/>
<br/>
You got the N.W.O. (low cash flow)<br/>
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)<br/>
And crosstown niggaz tryin to (bust at you)<br/>
Aiyyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)<br/>
So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact<br/>
with a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked<br/>
The switch hittin Queens, niggaz liquid sword spittin<br/>
with raw poppy, and now your first love is krill<br/>
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover<br/>
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover<br/>
And all I want is my laceration of the pie<br/>
to get this whip cream before the water runs dry<br/>
Niggaz flashdancin yo I don't know why<br/>
You're sick of snitchin, she got you cruisin to the pokey<br/>
like Smokey, the stress be tryin to squeeze out a homey<br/>
While I be tryin to get star status like Shinobi<br/>
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's<br/>
And all I want, is the world to know my steez<br/>
These money hungry niggaz is seven thirty<br/>
And got me stressed out like these frog MC's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Faith Evans]</i><br/>
