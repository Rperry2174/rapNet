<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
All we want in this life<br/>
Is peace, prosperity and a little paper<br/>
Objects that seem greater<br/>
But I'm sure well over come when we illin on a drum<br/>
<i>[repeat x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
We in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis<br/>
Y'all can be my witnesses<br/>
That a fella fascination with money has grown<br/>
To the point that he will shit on his own<br/>
We got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic<br/>
A piece of paper makin niggaz get dramatic<br/>
But the money doesnt come automatic<br/>
Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it<br/>
We got to get it yall, in an orderly fashion<br/>
Some cats go about it with too much passion<br/>
We got to mediate our greedy levels<br/>
Cuz the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil<br/>
Gotta recognize it, realize the power<br/>
that this little ma-huckin piece of paper will devour<br/>
Man can be greater than the thing he creates<br/>
See, I'ma do my thing and see how much I can scrape<br/>
Yo I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt<br/>
But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount<br/>
That the Sesame Street Dracula cant Count<br/>
So that I can give  my people when that thing surmounts<br/>
To higher levels.. of being.. so when I'm MC-ing<br/>
I hope to see you there steady G-ing (say word)<br/>
But the only way we can truly reach that goal<br/>
Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls<br/>
It's like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Phife]</i><br/>
<br/>
Here comes your royal highness, one of Queens finest<br/>
Believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it<br/>
Come on son, never leave your mic round me<br/>
True MC for real ask my man Shaheed<br/>
Strictly focused on what Im in this rap game for<br/>
Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore<br/>
With all that AIDS stuff going round<br/>
Tell me how that sound<br/>
Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound<br/>
Now, dont get me wrong I love honeys galore<br/>
But see hip-hop's my bread butter<br/>
Cause that's what I get paid for<br/>
See this is what I wanted<br/>
Allah helped me to get it<br/>
And if the beat is wicked<br/>
You know Malik will rip it<br/>
From the bottom of my heart <br/>
Thats where the love starts<br/>
The love for breakdancing<br/>
My love for the art<br/>
And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul<br/>
A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold<br/>
Yeah I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh etceteras<br/>
But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya<br/>
Im staying true nuff respect to those that paved the way<br/>
From Bambaata down to Shah; that be my DJ<br/>
With out my peeps I dont know how the hell Id make it, word<br/>
Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb<br/>
One love for the lendin hand and giving all your help<br/>
Believing in me when I didnt believe in my own self<br/>
The Abstract with whom Im always making rugged tunes<br/>
Kid Hood restin in heaven, I hope to see you soon<br/>
I keep things hot and this year they're even hotter<br/>
Big Mu and Shah, one day I'll take my shahada<br/>
Ou
