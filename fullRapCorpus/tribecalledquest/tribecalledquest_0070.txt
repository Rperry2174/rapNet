<i>[Punch]</i> Yo! We about to rock this joint, from the family.  And<br/>
we want ya'll all to know, that it's time...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS all:]</i><br/>
To rock rock ya'll<br/>
Freak freak ya'll<br/>
To the beat ya'll<br/>
It's unique ya'll  <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Punch]</i><br/>
A-yo praise the master, make plans wit' your pastor<br/>
My rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter<br/>
I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture<br/>
Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter<br/>
In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after<br/>
You only know half of the math, it don't add up<br/>
The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter<br/>
Watch me now!  Just begun like Jimmy Castor<br/>
I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders<br/>
Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter<br/>
Me and my squad build just like contractors<br/>
I break shit, you only give hairline fractures<br/>
Women flash us, don't know ya better ask us<br/>
A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters<br/>
Tear down the rafters, venerials couldn't clap us<br/>
You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jane Doe]</i><br/>
The church of scientology, feminine biology<br/>
Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we<br/>
Polluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology<br/>
While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy<br/>
Probably an oddesey, started back on robbery<br/>
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty<br/>
Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology<br/>
Let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology<br/>
Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!<br/>
Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology<br/>
Fuck modesty, studyin' microbiology<br/>
Causin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my geneology<br/>
Six months of sobriety, movin' very methodically<br/>
Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography<br/>
Guard technology, rip shows antibiotically<br/>
True thugs bionically, give birth to criminology<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Words]</i><br/>
Yo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin'<br/>
I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes or humpin'<br/>
For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in<br/>
I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'<br/>
Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven<br/>
One would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin'<br/>
Before I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin'<br/>
Oh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin'<br/>
But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin'<br/>
Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in<br/>
Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in<br/>
Told people you got in free when you really snuck in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
We never get concerned about who's in the league<br/>
We just stay workin' so no one will need<br/>
An unconcerned outsider givin' niggaz feed<br/>
My niggaz puff weed but negotiate the seed<br/>
The family is granite and you can't intercede<br/>
I try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed<br/>
Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed<br/>
We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these<br/>
Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed<br/>
Poker face creed while my mind just read<br/>
Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed<br/>
That's insignificant but this take heed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is<br/>
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is<br/>
I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is<br/>
My game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is<br/>
The aim is, to make you recognize what the name is<br/>
Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is<br/>
The place with the great superiginate the flavors<br/>
An all-star block with some all-star laymans<br/>
(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters<br/>
Achin' cuz they hear us rotatin' on the playlist<br/>
&gt;From B-boy laces to Detroit gators<br/>
Yo Tip I got to bail, where the scale?  Help me weigh this...<br/>
<br/>
Yo!  We wan't ya'll to know...that this is the family, right?  <br/>
And what we want everybody out there to do...on the dance floor...<br/>
is get ready...because noooowwwwww we gonna...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS <i>[x6]</i> to fade out]</i>
