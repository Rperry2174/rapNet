<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
Check the rhyme y'all.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden,<br/>
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'.<br/>
It was I the abstract<br/>
<i>[P:]</i><br/>
And me the five footer.<br/>
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter.<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine<br/>
That we used to make spiffy like mister clean?<br/>
<i>[P:]</i><br/>
Um um, a tidbit, um, a smidgen.<br/>
I don~t get the message so you gots to run the pigeon.<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i> You on point Phife?<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> All the time, tip.<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i> You on point Phife?<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> All the time, tip.<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i> You on point Phife?<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> All the time, tip.<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i> Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip.<br/>
<i>[P:]</i><br/>
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am.<br/>
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram.<br/>
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long.<br/>
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong.<br/>
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong.<br/>
I slayed that body in El Segundo then push it along.<br/>
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man<br/>
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am.<br/>
A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see.<br/>
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's.<br/>
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me.<br/>
They get vexed, I roll next, can~t none contest me.<br/>
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave.<br/>
On top remaining, no home training cause I misbehave.<br/>
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check.<br/>
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect.<br/>
You see, my aura~s positive I don't promote no junk.<br/>
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk.<br/>
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard.<br/>
So just clean out your ears and just check the word.<br/>
<br/>

<i>[P:]</i><br/>
Back in days on the boulevard of Linden,<br/>
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'<br/>
It was I the Phifer,<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
And me, the abstract.<br/>
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack.<br/>
<i>[P:]</i><br/>
Yo, tip you recall when we used to rock<br/>
Those fly routines on your cousin~s block.<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
Um, let me see, damn I can't remember.<br/>
I receive the message and you will play the sender.<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> You on point Tip?<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i> All the time Phife.<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> You on point Tip?<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i> Yeah, all the time Phife.<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> You on point Tip?<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i> Yo, all the time Phife.<br/>
<i>[P:]</i> So play the resurrector and give the dead some life.<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock.<br/>
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock,<br/>
With speed. I'm agile plus I'm worth your while.<br/>
One hundred percent intelligent black child.<br/>
My optic presentation sizzles the retina.<br/>
How far must I go to gain respect? Um.<br/>
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own<br/>
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone.<br/>
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty,<br/>
Record company people are shady.<br/>
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack,<br/>
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act.<br/>
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum.<br/>
Pass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and...<br/>
Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper.<br/>
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop.<br/>
<br/>
NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all.<br/>
SC, y'all check it out y'all.<br/>
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all.<br/>
Check it out. Out.<br/>
In London, check the rhyme, y'all.
