<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Yea, move your body, decide to party<br/>
'Bout to bring it to you kid like we never ever did<br/>
My nigga Al G in it, my nigga Shaheed in it<br/>
We got the girl Kristine in it, got my man Big G in it<br/>
<br/>
Hey, yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow<br/>
I'ma make you move whether woman or fellow<br/>
Yo, I got the medals in the warfield of respect<br/>
Like an ill porno make ya body get wet<br/>
Just a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow<br/>
Hoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow<br/>
I'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will<br/>
MC's you ready to die cuz I'ma kill<br/>
All you negative feelings standing on two feet<br/>
While I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat<br/>
You know what's really killer, realer than you can imagine<br/>
Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen<br/>
If I make it happen, that means I'm making motion<br/>
And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion<br/>
Everybody do the hop, niggaz soothe like lotion<br/>
I lay up in the piece or an incognotion<br/>
You gotta do the hop then move to the beat, you don't stop<br/>
Now everybody here, you do the hop<br/>
You going up to cop, a town full of brick, don't stop<br/>
You gotta come back and do the hop<br/>
Yo, fuk the cop, you gotta come back and do the hop<br/>
Move till your body won't stop<br/>
You gotta do the hop, nonstop motion, nonstop<br/>
You gotta come back and do the, do the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
You see you, your career is done like Johnny Carson's<br/>
Get me vexed, I do like Left Eye, I'll start an arson<br/>
Now that I got that out my system<br/>
Watch me stab up the track as if my name was OJ Simpson<br/>
I packs it in like Van Halen<br/>
I work for mine, you, you're freeloading like Kato Kaelin<br/>
I'm representing wit my crew<br/>
Mess around, bite my rhymes, I beat that ass wit my shoes<br/>
C'mon, you know I'm crazy nice (nice, nice)<br/>
Brothers can't deal wit this shorty named Phife<br/>
You must be mad in the head<br/>
I bust his ass and leave 'em bloodclot for dead<br/>
Niggaz sound like Das EFX<br/>
If it ain't Das EFX, then they sounding like Meth<br/>
You might as well do Megadeth<br/>
Yo, punk MC's better save your freaking breath<br/>
You'se a corny muthafuka<br/>
You must be high smoking dust wit Chris Tucker<br/>
You
