<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't eat no ham  n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol<br/>
A yo, Phife do you eat  em? No, Tip do you eat  em?<br/>
Uh huh, not at all(again)<br/>
I don't eat no ham  n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol<br/>
Jarobi, do you eat  em? Nope, Shah, do you eat  em? (Nope)<br/>
Not at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip and Phife trading lines:]</i><br/>
A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?<br/>
Some veggie links and some fish that stinks<br/>
Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house<br/>
Smelled like she conjured up a mouse<br/>
Eggs was fryin, ham was smellin<br/>
In ten minutes, she started yellin (come and get it)<br/>
And the gettin's were good<br/>
I said, I shouldn't eat, she said, I think you should<br/>
But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians<br/>
No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian<br/>
Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak<br/>
Goes on my plate<br/>
Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy<br/>
Candied yams inside my tummy<br/>
A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats<br/>
Apple sauce and some nice red beets<br/>
This is what we snack on when we're Questin'<br/>
<i>[both:]</i> No second guessin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[Q-Tip: bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings<br/>
The food that is the everlasting, see I'm not fasting<br/>
I'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey<br/>
Beef jerky, slim jims, I eat sometimes<br/>
I like lemons and limes<br/>
And if not that, take it the road see and the salad sopped<br/>
Sit back, relax, listen to some hip hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes<br/>
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies<br/>
And other goodies that are filled with goop<br/>
With fried apple roots<br/>
Delectable delights, control my appetites<br/>
Mine is for me, right, but I know what I like<br/>
Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner<br/>
Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin winner<br/>
When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize<br/>
Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides<br/>
Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes<br/>
Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there<br/>
Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose<br/>
This is how it goes<br/>
<br/>
I don't eat no ham  n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol<br/>
A yo, Phife do you eat  em? Nah, Tip do you eat  em?<br/>
Uh huh, not at all(come again, y'all)<br/>
I don't eat no ham  n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol<br/>
Jarobi, do you eat  em? Nope, Shah, do you eat  em? <br/>
Nope, not at all<br/>
I don't eat no ham  n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol<br/>
Afrika do you eat  em? No, Pos, do you eat  em? <br/>
Hell yeah, all the time<br/>
I don't eat no ham  n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol<br/>
Phife, do you eat  em? Nah, Tip, do you eat  em? <br/>
Uh huh, not at all<br/>
Jarobi, do you eat  em? Nope, Shah, do you eat  em? <br/>
Nope, not at all<br/>
I don't eat no ham  n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol<br/>
Afrika, do you eat  em? No, Gary, do you eat  em? <br/>
Yeah, all the time <i>[laughing]</i>
