<i>[Verse One: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yup yup yup<br/>
To the North to the South to the East to the West<br/>
I don't discriminate boy I bring it to your chest<br/>
If you oppose, then your soul will decompose<br/>
Strive to get money and I'm not no hoe<br/>
Fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose<br/>
Fuller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes<br/>
You can ask Bo but yo that nigga don't know<br/>
About the dominant factor the accurate rapper<br/>
Here's the next chapter, page ninety-five<br/>
Niggaz so hard it's a wonder they alive<br/>
But yo we still survive through the danger that lurks<br/>
My eyes remain wide while you ask like Urk<br/>
and yo my Family Matters, so all you mad hatters<br/>
Put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm<br/>
Cause I got the plan that wins and can't lose<br/>
Your man knows who's nice say Tip he'll say "True"<br/>
A lot of these jokers out here is blase<br/>
I'll be rockin mikes until a horse says hey<br/>
Some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz<br/>
Actin all boogee and making big movies<br/>
But I'll be in the cut call me Incognito<br/>
Busy makin joints that will bump for my people<br/>
You're listening to a man who was something for nothing<br/>
Stay in me forever head, never be frontin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Once in a while we have fun in the mix (never ever)<br/>
In to good living, but some be into glitz (true dat)<br/>
Everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks (trigga E)<br/>
Gotta wear a shoe that fits<br/>
...to all my peoples<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
C'mon word, check it out now (you out there?)<br/>
Uh, uh, check it out now (you out there?)<br/>
What? Uh, check it out now (louder!  louder!)<br/>
(louder!  louder!) Uh, check it out, yo<br/>
<br/>
Peace to the girl named Hurricane G<br/>
Peace to my girl named Dawn Paris<br/>
Peace to the Organzied Kon-fus-ion<br/>
Peace to all my shorties that be dying too young<br/>
Peace to both coasts and the land in between<br/>
Peace to your man if you're doing your thing<br/>
Peace to my peoples who was incarcerated<br/>
Asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it<br/>
Devouring, and towering over fools<br/>
Your mic is broke and my shit's cool<br/>
The black man with the understandin of<br/>
The three wise men and the theories of Zen<br/>
Yo I get inside the crevice like a dentist<br/>
Disrupt, the block, like Dennis, the Menace<br/>
Shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble<br/>
or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like Boggle<br/>
Bingo!  That was the damn dog's name<br/>
But yo I know another one with much more fame<br/>
The Phife Dawg, and that's my word to the cipher<br/>
About to bring it to your chest and cause strife check it out<br/>
You're doubling back, to your rhyming pad<br/>
What I represent is MC's gone mad<br/>
In a perfect world there's imperfect acts<br/>
We've come like a God to redirect alla that<br/>
So people with a gift can just flaunt and get money<br/>
So much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny<br/>
Money is invested in real estate and stocks<br/>
But not inside the glamour cuz all of that stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Consequence]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo dis the Cons to the Quence<br/>
up in ya like a stiff one, knowhatImean?<br/>
It's nine-five, you got to live it or rip it<br/>
So if you step on the streets keep it movin, knowhatImean?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
