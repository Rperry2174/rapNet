My mother went away for a month-long trip<br/>
Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship<br/>
She made a big mistake by leaving me home<br/>
I had to roam so I picked up the phone<br/>
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down<br/>
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around<br/>
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74<br/>
My mother left a yard but I needed one more<br/>
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks<br/>
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks<br/>
drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit<br/>
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it<br/>
Had no destination, we was on a quest<br/>
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest<br/>
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half<br/>
The sun had just risen on a dusty path<br/>
Just then a figure had caught my eye<br/>
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high<br/>
I pulled over to ask were we was at<br/>
His index finger he tipped up his hat<br/>
"El Segundo," he said, "my name is Pedro<br/>
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto"<br/>
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation<br/>
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station<br/>
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor<br/>
Ali said, "Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for?"<br/>
<br/>
(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway a gas station we passed<br/>
We got gas and went on to get grub<br/>
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere<br/>
Anywhere would have been better<br/>
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em<br/>
Ali had the fruit punch<br/>
When we finished we thought for ways to get back<br/>
I had a hunch<br/>
Ali said, "Pay for lunch"<br/>
So I did it<br/>
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady<br/>
She was a waitress there<br/>
Put the wallet down and stared and stared<br/>
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed:<br/>
"Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?"<br/>
I checked for keys and started to step <br/>
What do you know, my wallet I forget<br/>
<br/>
Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers <br/>
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man<br/>
<br/>
Lord, have mercy<br/>
The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me<br/>
I fell bad but he makes me feel badder<br/>
Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter<br/>
Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound<br/>
Jettin' on down at the seepd of sound<br/>
Three days coming and three more going<br/>
We get back and there was no slack<br/>
490 Madison, we're here, Sha<br/>
He said, "All right, Tip, see you tomorrow"<br/>
Thinking about the past week, the last week<br/>
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak<br/>
Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack<br/>
Of Shaheed, "We gotta go back" when he said<br/>
"Why?" I said, "We gotta go<br/>
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo<br/>
Left my wallet in El Segundo<br/>
Left my wallet in El Segundo<br/>
I gotta get, I got-got ta get it
