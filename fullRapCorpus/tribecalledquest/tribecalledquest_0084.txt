Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized<br/>
With your black hair and fat-ass thighs<br/>
Street poetry is my everyday<br/>
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way<br/>
If I was workin at the club you would not pay<br/>
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got somthin to say<br/>
<br/>
I like em brown, yellow, Puero Rican or Hatian<br/>
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation<br/>
Told you in the jam that We Can Get Down<br/>
Now let's Knock the Boots like the group H-Town<br/>
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall<br/>
But I'm Above the Rim and this is how I ball<br/>
A pretty little somethin on the New York street<br/>
This is how I represent over this here beat<br/>
Talkin bout you<br/>
<br/>
Yo, I took you out<br/>
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route<br/>
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state<br/>
But I couldn't drop dimes cause *you couldnèª¸ relate*<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl<br/>
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall<br/>
Starin at your dome-piece, very strong<br/>
Stronger Than Pride, stronger than Teflon<br/>
Take you on the ave and you buy me links<br/>
Now I wanna pound the putang until it stinks<br/>
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy<br/>
<br/>
Original rude boy, never am I coy<br/>
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy<br/>
Not to come across as a thug or a hood<br/>
But hon, you got the goods, like Madeline Woods<br/>
By the way, my name's Malik<br/>
The Five-Foot Freak<br/>
Let's say we get together by the end of the week<br/>
She simply said, "No," labelled me a hoe<br/>
I said, "How you figure?"  "My friends told me so."<br/>
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap<br/>
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that<br/>
<br/>
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak<br/>
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep<br/>
Keep it in the down, yo, we keep it discrete<br/>
See, I'm not the type to kid to have my biz in the streets<br/>
<br/>
If my mom donèª¸ approve, then I'll just elope<br/>
Let me sink the little man from inside the boat<br/>
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia<br/>
Bust off on your couch, now you got semen's furniture<br/>
<br/>
Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P<br/>
Stacy, ? DJ and my man L.G.<br/>
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice<br/>
The character is  of men, never ever of mice<br/>
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice<br/>
It has to do with lots of lovin and (it ain't nuthin nice)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
