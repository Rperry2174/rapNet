<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Can I kick it?  (Yes, you can!) <i>[7X]</i><br/>
Well, I'm gone  (Go on then!)<br/>
<br/>
Can I kick it?  To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does<br/>
Before this, did you really know what live was?<br/>
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz<br/>
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers<br/>
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz<br/>
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug<br/>
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug<br/>
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug<br/>
Afrocentric living is a big shrug<br/>
A life filled with *HORN* that's what I love<br/>
A lower plateau is what we're above<br/>
If you diss us, we won't even think of<br/>
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?<br/>
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove<br/>
Like a box of positives is a plus, love<br/>
As the Tribe flies high like a dove<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
Can I kick it?  (Yes, you can!) <i>[7X]</i><br/>
Well, I'm gone  (Go on then!)<br/>
<br/>
Can I kick it?  To my Tribe that flows in layers<br/>
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer<br/>
At times, I'm a studio conveyor<br/>
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?<br/>
You'll be doing us a really big favor<br/>
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor<br/>
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior<br/>
Follow us for the funky behavior<br/>
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya<br/>
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir<br/>
Do you like the garments that we wear?<br/>
I instruct you to be the obeyer<br/>
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor<br/>
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major<br/>
Yes, the Tribe of the game, rhythm player<br/>
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
