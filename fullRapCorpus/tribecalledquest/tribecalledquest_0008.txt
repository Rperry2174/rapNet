<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
The taste of nuthin, this does somethin<br/>
Moms that knows that, says I'm frontin<br/>
Call me Smiley, cuz I'm wiley<br/>
Livin life like the life of Riley<br/>
Smokin blunts with a boy named Bud<br/>
We cough up your lungs, cough up your cud<br/>
Put out fires, with a 40, ounce of water<br/>
You know you oughta<br/>
Dance to this, your girl you kiss<br/>
I like fried foods, especially fish<br/>
Afrocentric, I'm electric<br/>
Socialistic and eccentric<br/>
Body's healthy, mind is wealthy<br/>
Thoughts, they flow, that will prepare me<br/>
To be a Native, get creative<br/>
Original and designative<br/>
Listen to the line that's playin<br/>
Listen hard to what Q's sayin<br/>
Politicians are magicians<br/>
Make your vote, they hope your wishin<br/>
Ambiguous words, senseless verbs<br/>
They all amount to crap that's heard<br/>
Violent hip hop, money flip flops<br/>
Promoters won't book, but it still rocks<br/>
I'm a Zulu, yes, a true blue<br/>
Red Alert is with the poo-poo<br/>
Ozone layer, loses flava<br/>
Here's the edge that you will savor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jarobi:]</i><br/>
The economy...politics...police...everything<br/>
Except for the youth<br/>
But the youth about to come back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip(voice distorted):]</i><br/>
Alright, here they come<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
With expressions and I'm guessin<br/>
19 years is a youthful lesson<br/>
Fallin skies babe, open eyes babe<br/>
Can't you see what lays inside babe<br/>
Makin mentions on this tension<br/>
Rhythmic lovin, my profession<br/>
Hips, they gyrate, scripts I narrate<br/>
No banana, I ain't a primate<br/>
Ain't no soul glo, just an afro<br/>
The head is bred to let the thoughts grow<br/>
Quest together, to lands of never<br/>
Sleet and snow and storms can't sever<br/>
Tribe is growin, never know when<br/>
For this time, six necks may show in<br/>
Dialogues have been accepted<br/>
Negatives have been rejected<br/>
That's the music, negro music<br/>
Is here for all, so you must choose it<br/>
Phonies fondle, watch it throttle<br/>
3-6-5 straight out the bottle<br/>
Bustin caps, finger snaps<br/>
I prefer the second for ghetto tracks<br/>
Phife, Jarobi, Ali told me<br/>
Get the force like Wan Kenobi<br/>
Force his teachin, beats are screechin<br/>
Poly plateaus, we aim for reachin<br/>
Tribalization, freaks the nation<br/>
A mass of peers in celebration<br/>
Hopes been real high, since the knee high<br/>
Days of youth, feelin good and real spry<br/>
Avid combos, hear those bongos<br/>
Boom cacka boom, that's how they go<br/>
We ain't nomads, but we real glad<br/>
Hip hop slams through the nineties, no fad<br/>
As a rhythm, have been given<br/>
Hurry up, become, we breakin out, out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shaheed:]</i><br/>
With a rhythmic instinction to be able to travel <br/>
Beyond existing forces of life<br/>
Basically, that Tribal<br/>
And if you wanna get the rhythm<br/>
Then you have to join a Tribe<br/>
Word, peac
