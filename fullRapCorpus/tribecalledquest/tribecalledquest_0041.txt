<i>[Busta Rhymes]</i> "Oh my God!" <i>[16X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
There's a million MC's that claim they want some<br/>
But see, I create sounds that make your ears go numb<br/>
Peace to Sayers Ave., yeah you know how we go<br/>
My best friend Steven at the Home Depot<br/>
Lowerton is in the house, I can't forget Southside<br/>
Walk past MC's like that girl did the Pharcyde<br/>
I'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how<br/>
Act like you know, not now, but right now<br/>
Beast of the East, on MC's I have a feast<br/>
I'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice<br/>
Straight out Jamaica scene, Jamaica, Queens<br/>
But you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between<br/>
Now if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good<br/>
If Malik don't look good, the Quest won't look good<br/>
If the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good<br/>
But since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good<br/>
Picture Phife losin a battle, come on, get off it<br/>
Put down the microphone son, surrender forfeit<br/>
Did I hear somethin bout a crew?  What they wanna do?<br/>
You better call Mr. Babyface, so he can bring out _The Cool in You_<br/>
or it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton<br/>
And I'll dissect you like a fraction<br/>
Oh, you wannabe top cat MC's, I'll pop you like a zit<br/>
You wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit<br/>
Big up myself everytime when it comes to this<br/>
MC's be runnin scared as if they're watchin the Exorcist<br/>
I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead<br/>
My styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast fed<br/>
You know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene<br/>
I dedicate this to all the MC's outta Queens <br/>
that goes for Onyx, LL, Run-D.M.C.<br/>
Akinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P<br/>
You need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other<br/>
Nuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover<br/>
Yo, Tip don't worry Dunn you know I get the party jumpin <br/>
Get on the mic and break em off a lil lil sumthin<br/>
Yo, Tip don't worry Dunn you know I get the party jumpin<br/>
Get on the mic and break em off a lil lil sumthin  (Ooohh...)<br/>

La, la, la, la..<br/>
Doop, doo, do, do..<br/>
La, la, la, la..<br/>
Shooby-doop, do, do..<br/>
La, la, la, la..<br/>
Shooby-doo, do, do..<br/>
You know I'm on the other, for the top 40<br/>
Haha, you gotta do it like this..<br/>
<br/>
We got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit<br/>
So recognize me, kids memorize me<br/>
Everyday, I be scroungin, really, I be loungin<br/>
I play the down low, very very incognito<br/>
Aries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme<br/>
Sometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the hunnies wiggle<br/>
Intellect is the major, some heads like to wager<br/>
The skills on the hill, overlookin dollar bills<br/>
Man, ya crazy, thinkin you can phase me<br/>
The Ab doesn't study near nonsense money<br/>
Life seems to meet me, MC's seem too cheesy<br/>
With they doody ass renditions of defeatin competition<br/>
I rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man<br/>
Bet'cha bottom dolla, Vinia will make ya holla<br/>
As ya stand at attention, did I forget to mention<br/>
MC's will give me twenty, if I sense that they act funny<br/>
Lyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant<br/>
Just mentionin the fact, that the area is fat<br/>
I dwell in the unda, so hunny, it's no wonder<br/>
That I get plenty of tail, well I even get white<br/>
I'ma bet hittin head crack, there money, take that<br/>
Breakin niggaz off, cut their bank, then I'm off<br/>
While my Nik'es match my lil hat, beat joint is mad fat<br/>
Got the cutter of the box if a kid thinks he's ox<br/>
For tier means creator, the poetry relator<br/>
It's hemp, like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss<br/>
<br/>
La, la, la.. (<i>[Busta Rhymes]</i> "Oh my God!")<br/>
