Lyrics to go (lyrics to go) uhh<br/>
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go) ahh yeah, c'mon<br/>
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go)<br/>
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go) yeah yeah<br/>
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go)<br/>
<br/>
Goin on and on to the rhythmic variation<br/>
Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation<br/>
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation<br/>
Rebels of the party who create the jump sensation<br/>
Mind is a pit of different information<br/>
Microphone is on so of course communication<br/>
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation<br/>
Decaptatin foes yo as if my name was Jason (c'mon)<br/>
Makin all the fellas at the party lose composure<br/>
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)<br/>
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever<br/>
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor<br/>
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better<br/>
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her<br/>
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco<br/>
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa<br/>
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily<br/>
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey<br/>
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go<br/>
<br/>
(I got lyrics to go) It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all<br/>
Lyrics to go<br/>
It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all<br/>
(Lyrics to go) It's like that<br/>

<i>[Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin<br/>
Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin<br/>
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin<br/>
Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin<br/>
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it<br/>
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it<br/>
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly<br/>
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme)<br/>
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)<br/>
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded<br/>
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)<br/>
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal<br/>
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)<br/>
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? (mmm)<br/>
This I dedicate to all the honiest that be bogle-in<br/>
Cause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans<br/>
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go<br/>

<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal<br/>
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uhh)<br/>
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)<br/>
Calm and serene like the study was tayo<br/>
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms<br/>
Immune to disease I defeat organisms<br/>
that are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters<br/>
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters (uh)<br/>
Winners turn to losers, losers are forgotten<br/>
Tangle in my fore with, hopes that I stop rockin<br/>
Never will that happen only if it is permitted (uhh)<br/>
Wait... I think somebody shitted (c'mon)<br/>
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin<br/>
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings<br/>
Always try to lead yo never will I follow<br/>
Blowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo<br/>
And when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go<br/>
<br/>
Check it out y'all<br/>
