<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Here in 1992 we present<br/>
The fabulous What's The Scenario remix<br/>
Whereas there are seven MC's<br/>
Six which are in physical form and one which is in spiritual essence<br/>
And he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Hood:]</i><br/>
Check the vibe, walk that ass or get got<br/>
F it (shit) I lick buckshots<br/>
Hood, madman, I rip up stages<br/>
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis<br/>
Extra, extra, pick up a clip<br/>
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!) and grab my dick (Ohh!)<br/>
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs<br/>
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty<br/>
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news<br/>
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews<br/>
Death on the phono, my skills are porno<br/>
You say "oh no," you bitch ass homo<br/>
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time<br/>
I slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time<br/>
Sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga<br/>
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river<br/>
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can<br/>
(Say what, say what?) I'm a bad, bad man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg:]</i><br/>
Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip<br/>
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips<br/>
The five-foot assassin has just raided your area<br/>
Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya<br/>
(So!) Roll out the red carpet cause I'm kickin' this<br/>
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous<br/>
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew<br/>
And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, F you too<br/>
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to<br/>
You're better off calling D-Nice to your rescue<br/>
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around<br/>
As for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I shut 'em down<br/>
The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop<br/>
The five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop<br/>
So do like Michael Jackson and "Remember the Time" (Do you remember?)<br/>
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin cause you sure can't rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cut Monitor Milo:]</i><br/>
(Big up, big up!) Enter new identity<br/>
Next to say something cause you pass it to me<br/>
What does it take to check a technique?<br/>
(Many styles, many styles!)<br/>
Hostile heat, brings bursts of energy<br/>
Milo in De Dance is the new identity<br/>
One two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect<br/>
Ten to one that I come (Correct!)<br/>
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots<br/>
So I can grow dreadlocks<br/>
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)<br/>
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)<br/>
Kicking right inna your what's it not<br/>
I could rock longer but fair is fair<br/>
So C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)<br/>
C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Brown:]</i><br/>
Makin moves y'all (Moves y'all!) On and on and on<br/>
(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn<br/>
(Who's that?!) just one of the L.O.N.S<br/>
And a Tribe Called Quest (East coast) to West<br/>
Remix mad kick, more than Metallica<br/>
To all MCs fall like the Battlestar Galactica<br/>
Stampin', stompin', rompin' Compton<br/>
(People all over the world!) I'm promptin (Style!)<br/>
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle<br/>
Representation, sensationalization<br/>
"Scenario" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so<br/>
(Here we go yo!) Yeah<br/>
Force, Main Source LP on the rise<br/>
In living color we'll see seen through original eyes<br/>
And I'm out like shout, Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh<br/>
(Ooh ahh, ooh ahh!) There it is baby pah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dinco D:]</i><br/>
Flying in on a limb, slim trim, D I am<br/>
There I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim<br/>
Sight we be right, be polite for my mics<br/>
Like I'm like (See sick, see syke)<br/>
And slip away, and off to the Poconos<br/>
Spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose<br/>
Yamaha (Ay-Ha May!)<br/>
Let's split the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)<br/>
Enough enough, Ms. Fitted I'm with it<br/>
If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it<br/>
Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys<br/>
Bed rest, spread test, and yo I'm like the maddest<br/>
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale<br/>
Bounce the b-ball cause beats are being yelled<br/>
In the hallways always ringing with a (Ho!)<br/>
This one two times nine on the Scenario<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Check it out everybody, rhymes and mics<br/>
Black Benz gettin looped (Doin' what they like!)<br/>
Eight black brothers in the public eye<br/>
If you listen very close, I will tell you why<br/>
(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown<br/>
Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down<br/>
Will commence to rock (Rock!) So bring on the flocks (Flock!)<br/>
In-terrogation for the knockin of the box<br/>
The boom-box ruler, controls the medulla<br/>
None come cooler, I win like Shula<br/>
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her<br/>
Intensified mind, nine-blunt consumer<br/>
Tip will come booty (Well it's only a rumor!)<br/>
The meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)<br/>
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner<br/>
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Hey what we gon do (Dooo) in '92<br/>
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91<br/>
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down<br/>
Ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground<br/>
What's goin on my man? (Goddamn!) And now my brain is hurtin'<br/>
Listen up, Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em<br/>
Rip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em<br/>
Open up your mouth if you want the food<br/>
To get rude, Flipmode, cause I'm in the mood<br/>
Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah man, that's how it goes<br/>
Body drippin with blood comin out your nose<br/>
Give me a Band-Aid, what are you askin for?<br/>
(More!) Only your sacred and pure<br/>
Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap<br/>
Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes<br/>
Yeah y'all in '92, I'm packin my roach spray (Anyway!)<br/>
Ding-A-Ling, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School<br/>
Mad brother when stealthy RRRAAAOW RRAOW RRAOW!<br/>
To my dragon, baby, stop whinin' I see my influence still shinin'<br/>
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo<br/>
That's the Scenario!
