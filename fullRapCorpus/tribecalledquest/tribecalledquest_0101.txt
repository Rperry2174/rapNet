<i>[André 3000:]</i><br/>
I ain't even gon' lie, I was probably high<br/>
Just forgot to call you back, simple as that<br/>
I ain't no almanac, so lick my dictionary<br/>
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary<br/>
Yellow accents on a dark bitch<br/>
I met her back when she kept all her carpet<br/>
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy<br/>
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B<br/>
That's demeanor, momma's mannerisms<br/>
That mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some<br/>
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts<br/>
It's cold out in this bitch, standing on the corner<br/>
Condolences to niggas that got erased<br/>
I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave<br/>
Mmm, digital church bells<br/>
Ringin' 'cross the street, sure work well<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna get up now, I don't wanna go to school<br/>
I don't wanna be the best, don't wanna follow rules<br/>
Mom, I think you fuckin' lied to me<br/>
Three stacks said all this shit is fantasy<br/>
It's my time, gon' put a little life to it<br/>
If life's a obstacle then I'mma bike through it<br/>
I see it like a kiddie on the carousel<br/>
If I 'url while I go around, what the hell<br/>
And that went well, so I'm compelled<br/>
To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel<br/>
My young nigga motto was, "Fuck it, I'm already grown"<br/>
And I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home<br/>
That petty though, 'cause my mama boyfriend dough<br/>
It's kinda long like this old head hustle, yo<br/>
He cognizant of a nigga ride and die<br/>
I see us getting money through my green eyes<br/>

<i>[André 3000 &amp; Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Yeah, all the kids, all the what, uh<br/>
Yeah, all the badass kids, uh<br/>
Kids, say I'm the shit<br/>
I'm Chick-fil-A nuggets, McDonald's french fries<br/>
The spicy Popeye's and Red Lobster biscuits<br/>
And girls scout thin mints<br/>
Pardon my penmanship, but oh shit<br/>
Feel like I'm hungry now again<br/>
And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted<br/>
And my mom and my pop, they just grin<br/>
And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies<br/>
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens<br/>
Them grown-up stories don't work<br/>
In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in<br/>
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids<br/>
Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up<br/>
They stood on the corner<br/>
Like you once upon a, time<br/>
And probably felt like a loner<br/>
And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona<br/>
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning<br/>
Complaining that you always moaning<br/>
Never saying good morning<br/>
Storming out my house<br/>
And slamming doors like you paying bills<br/>
They been through it too, though<br/>
They were kids like you, though<br/>
But what if they knew though<br/>
And hit you with the cheat code<br/>
To a game you just start playing, no extra man<br/>
Leave you reckless on the court<br/>
With no high percentage shot<br/>
Just a bunch of, "You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got"<br/>
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht<br/>
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking<br/>
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting<br/>
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty<br/>
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?<br/>
They don't play no more, probably<br/>
<br/>
