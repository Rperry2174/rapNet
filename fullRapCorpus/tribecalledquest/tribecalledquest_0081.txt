<i>[Chorus: Tribe and L.O.N.S.]</i><br/>
<br/>
Here we go yo, here we go yo<br/>
So what so what so what's the scenario<br/>
Here we go yo, here we go yo<br/>
So what so what so what's the scenario<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo Bo knows this (what?) and Bo knows that (what?)<br/>
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap<br/>
Well whaddya know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat<br/>
No batteries included, and no strings attached<br/>
No holds barred, no time for move fakin<br/>
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon<br/>
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow<br/>
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so<br/>
Sleep if you want, like we'll help you get your Z's troop<br/>
But here's the real scoop<br/>
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome<br/>
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from<br/>
I'm vexed, fumin, I've had it up to here<br/>
My days of payin dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (YEAH)<br/>
Head for the border, go get a taco<br/>
I'll be wreckin from the jump street, meaning from the get-go<br/>
Sit back relax and let yourself go<br/>
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Charlie Brown]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yes yes y'all (yes y'all!) <br/>
who got the vibe it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all!)<br/>
real live y'all (live y'all!)<br/>
Inside outside come around... (who's that??)  Browwwwwwwwn<br/>
Some may, I say, call me Charlie<br/>
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley<br/>
Layback on the payback, <i>[evolve rotate the gates?]</i> CONTACT!<br/>
Can I get a hit? (HIT!)<br/>
Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip<br/>
East coast stompin, rippin and rompin<br/>
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton<br/>
Checka-checka-check it out!<br/>
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce<br/>
And wow how now wow how now Brown cow<br/>
We're ill till the skill gets down<br/>
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new<br/>
but the rest are doo-doo<br/>
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio<br/>
Tell me!  Yo, what's the scenario<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Dinco D]</i><br/>
<br/>
(True blue!)  Scooby Doo, whoopie doo<br/>
Scenario's ready yo, rates more than four<br/>
Scores for the snores that's lovin dancefloors<br/>
Now I go for mine, <i>[shades of G sure?]</i><br/>
Ship-shape plus Grape Apes to play tapes<br/>
Papes make grapes great for the waist<br/>
I'm an L-AH, an E-ADER, simply just a leader<br/>
Bass in his face means peace see ya later<br/>
Later?  (LATER!)  Later alligator<br/>
Pop blows the weasel and my Earth the inflater<br/>
So yo the D what the O, incorporated I-N-C into a flow<br/>
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight<br/>
Laugh yo how's that sound (ohhhhhh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's the leader Quest vision and we got the goods here (here!)<br/>
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!)<br/>
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal<br/>
Stay away from crime cause I ain't no CRIMINAL<br/>
I love my young nation, groovy sensation<br/>
No time for hibernation, only elation<br/>
Don't ever try to test, yo whattup little kid?<br/>
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did<br/>
<br/>
I heard you rushed and rushed, AND ATTACKED<br/>
Then baby puked then you had TO SMACK<br/>
Causin rambunction, throughout the sphere<br/>
Raise the levels of the boom, inside the ear<br/>
<br/>
You know I did it<br/>
So don't violate or you get violated<br/>
The hip-hop sound is well agitated<br/>
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego<br/>
So here's Busta Rhymes with the, Scenario<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Five: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
<br/>
Watch, as I combine all the juice from the mind<br/>
Heel up, reel up, bring it back, come rewind<br/>
Powerful impact BOOM! from the cannon<br/>
Not braggin, try to read my mind just imagine<br/>
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary<br/>
When diggin into my library<br/>
Oh my gosh!  Oh my gosh!<br/>
Eating ayea toadstool like the one Peter Tosh-a<br/>
Uh, uh uhh, alone with the track man<br/>
Uh, pardon me, uhh, as I come back<br/>
As I did it yo I heard you beg your pardon<br/>
When I travel to the Sun I roll with the squadron<br/>
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Change your little drawers cause your pants are saggin<br/>
Try to step to this, I will, fits you in a turban<br/>
And had you smellin right, like some old stale urine<br/>
Checkady-choco, the chocolate chicken<br/>
The rear cock diesel, for chicks they were kickin<br/>
Yo, bustin out before the Busta bust a nut the rhyme<br/>
the rhythm is in sync (UHH!) the rhymes are on time (TIME!)<br/>
Rippin up this dance just like a radio<br/>
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario!!<br/>
<i>[chorus starts]</i> Yeah, my man motherfucker!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
