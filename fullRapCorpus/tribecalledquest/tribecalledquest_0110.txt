Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind<br/>
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind<br/>
Ego, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'<br/>
Ego, ego<br/>
I got one, you got one, and now we equal<br/>
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people<br/>
Sometimes it has connotations of evil<br/>
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to<br/>
It's called the ego<br/>
<br/>
Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated<br/>
Some may hate it and some may overrate it<br/>
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend<br/>
So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen<br/>
It's called the ego<br/>
Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it<br/>
Then every time you mention it<br/>
They stare like you're two-headed<br/>
But one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view<br/>
Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you<br/>
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places<br/>
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well<br/>
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego<br/>
She knows you need the chicken<br/>
And you know that she's your people<br/>
They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy<br/>
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy<br/>
And now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy<br/>
Change your diet, hit the gym<br/>
And say, "What were you saying to me?"<br/>
The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music<br/>
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis<br/>
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest<br/>
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest<br/>
It's the ego<br/>
<br/>
Ooo, Jack White<br/>
Ooo, Jack White<br/>
<br/>
A celebrated genius, my dick game is the meanest<br/>
I'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented<br/>
I'll take the biggest house in Calabassas<br/>
Anyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes?<br/>
You need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling<br/>
Or when those kids in school on your locker<br/>
They get to scrawling<br/>
Epithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature<br/>
Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya<br/>
Ego make you violent or govern like a tyrant<br/>
Or switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant<br/>
Fool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles<br/>
Fooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models<br/>
Ego has no ending, has people pretending<br/>
Religious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending<br/>
This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us<br/>
And closing for our ego, we know only God can help us<br/>
<br/>
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind<br/>
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind<br/>
Ego, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'<br/>
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind<br/>
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind<br/>
Ego, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'<br/>
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind<br/>
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
