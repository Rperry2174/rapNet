<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Let me flaunt the style (style), I think that the time's near<br/>
That we drop studs (studs), there will be no duds here<br/>
Rappers play the dumb (dumb), kinda on the space tip<br/>
But when they hear the jams (jams), they be on the dilsnick<br/>
Now I'm not for the rock (rock), I know the territory<br/>
Go ahead and try (try), that's a different story<br/>
Similar to Grimm (Grimm), I could tell a better one<br/>
All about a kid (kid), who couldn't rap and didn't run<br/>
Stand (stand) aside (aside), when the rap is gettin dumb<br/>
Resort to baggin Billy (Billy), askin can he have some<br/>
No, never ever (ever) come back and try again man<br/>
If you come back (back), I'll be the first to shake your hand<br/>
Competitions good (good), it brings out the vital parts<br/>
The Abstract Poetic ('etic), majors in recital arts<br/>
Do it for the kids (kids), the elders and the rap peers<br/>
We know the job is done (done), when we hear a lot of cheers<br/>
Gotta feel the vibes (vibes), come from my creation<br/>
If the hands clap (clap) are filled with elation<br/>
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam<br/>
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream (scream)<br/>
Cause that's how good it feels child<br/>
Let your hair down (down), so we can get buckwild<br/>
Do your I'll dance (dance), don't think about the next man<br/>
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan<br/>
The vision, we fall (fall) we must stick together, see<br/>
I'd like to take this time (time) to say what's up to Kool G<br/>
The name is Q-Tip (Tip), The Midnight Marauder<br/>
Give enough respect ('spect) to Afrika Bambaataa<br/>
As a man in the world (world), I must do my job<br/>
Take care of Mama Duke (Duke), I won't resort to rob<br/>
Bob you'll get your dough (dough), Mase is my witness<br/>
Obsessed with the rap (rap), for it's the mental fitness<br/>
Like shootin cee-lo (lo), and always gettin headcracks<br/>
The industry is luck (luck), winning with the fake raps<br/>
Peace to the crews (crews), who pump the real hip hop<br/>
Not sellin out (out) from hardrock to disc jock...<br/>
(From disc jock to hardrock, from hardrock to disc jock)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it<br/>
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it<br/>
I'm just a short brotha, dark skin face<br/>
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist<br/>
My hair is crazy curly<br/>
Front like Mr. Furley<br/>
To this day, I still believe that no MC can serve me<br/>
Brothas try to front, but everybody know (know)<br/>
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show<br/>
Party animal I was, but now I chill at home<br/>
All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit and bone<br/>
Found my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island<br/>
Fudge and Monkey know the time, they know who keeps 'em smilin<br/>
Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do<br/>
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to<br/>
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double<br/>
Yo, I'm out like Buster Douglass, I say peace to MC Trouble<br/>
Rest in Peace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Word Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?<br/>
We got, we got, we got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
All the people in Long Island, we got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
Brooklyn and Queens, we got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
Uptown and New York, we got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
People upstate, we got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
If you're in DC, you got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
Maryland, Virginia, Carolina vibe (vibe)<br/>
Out West, we got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
In the Bahamas, we got the vibe (vibe)<br/>
Over in Europe, you know what? We got the vibe<br/>
And we gotta keep it alive, it goes on...<br/>
<br/>
Of rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of subs<br/>
Goods with the girls, I got a whole lot of 'em<br/>
From fat to skinny, Freeda to Winnie (Winnie)<br/>
Emma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy (Wendy)<br/>
Cause I be more friendly (friendly), never on the snotty side<br/>
I don't brag to brothas about the little papes I got (got)<br/>
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary (scary)<br/>
It's only legendary ('dary), my father well prepared me ('pared me)<br/>
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot<br/>
Better yet, the long term, I don't have a perm (perm)<br/>
In a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps<br/>
I'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy when I'm nappy<br/>
When I get the mic in my hand and the crowd in stands (stands)<br/>
It's as good as grand like that (that)<br/>
<br/>
I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble and to<br/>
Um... Trouble T-Roy<br/>
And to um... Scott La Rock and to um... Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin?<br/>
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers<br/>
You know what I'm sayin (sayin)?<br/>
This is a special, special, special, special, special dedication<br/>
And also to my pops and also to Vinny, his moms (moms)<br/>
You know what I'm sayin?<br/>
You just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going<br/>
And this is Vibes and Stuff<br/>
And we out...
