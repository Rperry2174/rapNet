<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Power. People really get caught with this on different levels <br/>
Power controls your life<br/>
Money. The companion of the first. Some people tend to worship<br/>
And we know this ain't right.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Attitude(attitude) is how I get my point across. <br/>
You can't call yourself an MC if you know that you're soft.<br/>
Agressive...is how the stage is approached. I burn MCs like toast<br/>
Cuz I'm the host with the most.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
Illin(illin) is what you do when you're assin.<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Sex(sex). Either a man or a woman. <br/>

<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Miserable(miserable) is what your whole crew will be<br/>
If you're not original and you show no strategy<br/>
Heavenly...is how the track tends to flow<br/>

Stress(stress). That's what I always go through<br/>
Cuz it's survival of the fittest on the 192<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>

On this plane of livin, knowledge be the key, black<br/>
Understanding. Gettin a grip on what's revealed<br/>
When shit be real, can't give understanding back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
Analyze. That's what I do to MCs<br/>
That be talkin  bout they this and that, money please<br/>

Cuz if I don't say I'm the best, tell me who the hell will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
Cheeba smoke y'all. That's what I use to get high<br/>
When I'm in a rut and I don't know why<br/>
Try. Yo try again my friend<br/>

<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
