<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
OOOOOOOHHHHH Ya <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
Say What?<br/>
We was in the back of the joint cooling out<br/>
And I saw this girl <br/>
Asked her if she like it like that<br/>
Nod her head yes, therefore I didn't stress<br/>
Let my beat keep knocking cause we rock it like that<br/>
Bust your ass slow, as if you didn't know<br/>
Put my mic inside your brain zone, dis home dis<br/>
It's the rhyme, it's the beat that vibe all together<br/>
That makes the competitors sound like this<br/>
Really do I care yo, I let down my hair<br/>
When the music's up loud man, I jums real that<br/>
Lyrical valow, in club, in the go <br/>
In jeep in America,Tribe go mad<br/>
Females ride when my niggas just ride<br/>
With the songs we creating and musically relating<br/>
Sex niggas talk, my body's in chart<br/>
Meanwhile they boot shaking<br/>
On some funk shit faking<br/>
Wait, I can't front, stick men <br/>
Hereâ€™s a few who really come to do<br/>
What they say gonna do <br/>
Back at the ranch<br/>
There's no car branch<br/>
Everybody gonna move when we say move<br/>
<br/>
Do you like it?<br/>
Say yeah if you like it like that<br/>
YEAH!!!!!<br/>
Do you like it?<br/>
Hell yeah if you like it like that<br/>
HELL YEAH!!!!!<br/>
Do you like it?<br/>
Tell me if you like it like that<br/>
YEAH!!!!!<br/>
Do you like it?<br/>
Verse two if you like it like that<br/>
COME ON!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Who could be the one<br/>
Rhyming ill, having fun<br/>
Blowing up, making musical memories and things<br/>
Elevate your thoughts on the vibe that we brought<br/>
While we climbing we shine like a super bowl ring<br/>
You could do it too<br/>
I mean hot like we do<br/>
It's a lot like we do and make your own mark<br/>
It's deeper than the song<br/>
Hope you live your life long<br/>
When you win, how you start, kid you gotta have heart<br/>
Niggas in my shit, move<br/>
Give a nigga room<br/>
Back it up, it's a grown man making on time<br/>
Plus you damn similar to Newport's<br/>
Smoking ain't a new sport<br/>
Smoke you sister in vendible<br/>
Gotta spread love, no matter where you are<br/>
Where you at, where you went<br/>
Cause nobody want beef<br/>
Fountain is good, just flows like a river<br/>
Just go with a nigga, kid my stay ain't brief<br/>
Put your heart in the day, in the night, family Enemies but yo I<br/>
really don't wet that<br/>
We was in the back of the joint cooling out<br/>
And saw this girl <br/>
Asked if her if she like it like that, yo<br/>
You like it that <i>[repeat till fade]</i>
