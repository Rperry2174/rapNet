<i>[Jimi Hendrix: Rain all day]</i><i>[2X]</i><br/>
<i>[Q-Tip: Don't you worry]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
All I wanna do is get down y'all<br/>
Have a ball y'all and freak freak y'all<br/>
Lifeless ventures ain't new boo<br/>
So don't boo hoo, yeah, you too<br/>
Gotta get a grip like culture<br/>
Swoop down, swoop down like a vulture<br/>
The rhythms will lurk into people<br/>
All funk ain't created equal<br/>
Lookin for the beat to rupture<br/>
Like the rapture, gotta capture<br/>
Don't let the storm of life scare ya<br/>
Get funky, let me prepare ya<br/>
For the days of grimness and oppression<br/>
A yo bro, here's your lesson<br/>
Even though the rain starts pourin<br/>
Start reachin, start soarin<br/>
Don't stop, if you do, you're stallin<br/>
Rhythm savior, hear ya callin<br/>
Instrumental to be freaky<br/>
Go ahead in the rain and you'll see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Can't we make you see<br/>
I mean, the fact that is the key, I mean<br/>
Devoted to the art of movin butts, so get on up and...<br/>
Think about what's yours<br/>
I mean your culture and your laws<br/>
I mean, I label you a sucka<br/>
If you're dumber, just stay dumber, but...<br/>
Stay in line and keep groovin<br/>
If it's movin, if it's soothin<br/>
Don't let a little thing like rain keep you unda<br/>
Or the fun-da, look at wonda<br/>
Stomp til your soul is lifted<br/>
Get with it, rhythm's with it<br/>
Get inside the groove and get nasty<br/>
Funky nasty, crazy classy<br/>
Money is a first on the list here <br/>
It's the good time, it's the good cheer<br/>
If you got the ride then ride it<br/>
Don't hide it, provide it<br/>
Drop, drop, drop down the pants, shake your fanny<br/>
Cuz it's handy, not an Annie<br/>
Rock to the roll with the hair down<br/>
Get the lowdown, rhythm showdown<br/>
The simple explanation is nada<br/>
Make it hotter, thanks, de nada<br/>
If you wanna hear what I'm sayin <br/>
Clean your ears and just come on and groove
