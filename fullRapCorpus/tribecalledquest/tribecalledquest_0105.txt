Yo, y'all ready?<br/>
Yo, Phife, you ready?<br/>
Cons, you got that part right?<br/>
I dunno but it don't matter who choose to set it off<br/>
ATCQ, no doubt my niggas is boss<br/>
Little half-ass rappers, y'all pissin' me off<br/>
Time to dead 'em all off, yo, no matter the cause<br/>

<i>[Consequence:]</i><br/>
(Black) They don't make thugs of this calibre<br/>
(Spasmodic) Who kept up the buzz the whole calendar<br/>
(Black) Used to sell drugs out the Challenger<br/>
(Spasmodic) Used to keep guns with the silencers<br/>
(Black) They don't make thugs of this calibre<br/>
(Spasmodic) Who kept up a buzz the whole calendar<br/>
(Black) Used to sell drugs out the Challenger<br/>
(Spasmodic) Now look what he does to any challenger<br/>
<br/>
Now who want it with the Trini gladiator?<br/>
The finger to you haters, you biters not innovators<br/>
I take zero for granted, I honors my gift<br/>
Champion pen game, plus I'm freestyle equipped<br/>
You clowns be bum sauce, speak my name, it's curtains<br/>
HamdulillƒÅh my crew's back to workin'<br/>
Trash rap the dead pussy, kill the turban<br/>
Fuck boys, sit down, shit can only get worsen<br/>
How do you touch mic with flows uncertain?<br/>
Speak game tribal, that flow ain't workin'<br/>
Folks doin' items, dem vex and cursin'<br/>
Fuck made me wanna see these niggas in person<br/>
Third song in, muthafuckas dispersin'<br/>
Only to realize Gana loose in the buildin'<br/>
Big tune this for man, woman and children<br/>
Back on my bullshit, Busta bust then we kill them<br/>

<br/>
My nigga's spirit be talkin' to me, let me explain<br/>
Not through evil mediums, tarot cards or Ouija games<br/>
But through mixing chords and boards and even drum machines<br/>
He be saying, "Nigga fuck awards, keep reppin' Queens<br/>
And don't be taking slack from these non-rapping niggas, man<br/>
That intellectual shit you spit, you better change your plan<br/>
Especially when you see them at the lobby of a label<br/>
And they don't seem able to outstretch they hands and admit they fans<br/>
You better flame 'em in the J's that they standing in<br/>
Ostracize they memory for not remembering<br/>
The articles reduce their body parts to particles<br/>
And dust the Dead Sea with their cremated molecules<br/>
I'm leaving, but nigga you still got the work to do<br/>
I expect the best from you, I'm watching from my heaven view<br/>
Don't disappoint me, make sure that they anoint me<br/>
As the blue ribbon pedigree, the best of show five-foot-three<br/>
Speak of the legacy for short people around the world<br/>
Napoleonic bionic people who cause the world to twirl<br/>
Rip every stage with grace, look right dead in they face<br/>
Live the Tribe principle of havin' impeccable taste<br/>
Enjoy that breath like that one was your last one left<br/>
If you don't believe me, Tip, there's truly life after death<br/>
So refer to the Biggie covers and shoutout my Trini brothers<br/>
And please check in on my mother," Malik Izaak, call me shorty<br/>
