Handle rocks with the capital G, ball on the beat<br/>
Status, Chris Paul and John Wall in the league<br/>
Grabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed<br/>
'Cause I believe<br/>
The potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed<br/>
If rationale is naturale or a weave<br/>
It's all edges and peas<br/>
Settin' press, we on a permanent steeze<br/>
I'm in a world where my princess is Leia<br/>
And she's feeling my Vader<br/>
And my lure grows greater and greater<br/>
Chem trails, droppin' poisonous vapors<br/>
Have you shaking like Gator<br/>
Been trill, nigga, process the data<br/>
Blu-ray, wave file, or a Beta, I'll DVR it for later<br/>
Kappo Masa with a G to my waiter<br/>
You can't define us, XY us, or Z us<br/>
You generational elitists<br/>
Have your chi in virtual think pieces<br/>
See, these written words are poetical science<br/>
Brain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby<br/>
They're a major appliance<br/>
Leave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant<br/>
Dude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers<br/>
Cool with some buyers<br/>
Yeah, nigga, cool with some growers<br/>
Never no tattletales, only I don't knowers<br/>
We a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us<br/>
So listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing<br/>
Mouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise<br/>
Dudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys<br/>
Versed in, rehearsed in the soothing of loins<br/>
Talk to Joey, Earl, Kendrick, and Cole, gatekeepers of flow<br/>
They are extensions of instinctual soul<br/>
It's the highest in commodity grade<br/>
And you could get it today<br/>
<br/>
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation<br/>
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation<br/>
Rules di nation<br/>
<br/>
One hitting reading pages of Poe<br/>
Telly is low, cuddle bunny ready to go<br/>
Day of the dead<br/>
Bury all the zombies instead<br/>
And it's just your aftermath, Busta cuttin' your dreads<br/>
Bruce Leein' niggas, while you niggas UFC<br/>
Smoke tree on niggas, sizzle out your USB<br/>
Surge pricing on these Ubers, I'mma get me a cab<br/>
Yo, where Jarobi at? Imbibing on impeccable grass<br/>
I be in NYC waiting for that law to pass<br/>
Pass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last<br/>
Richard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass<br/>
Magic Mike on the mic, David Blain, Douglass Henning<br/>
In the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting<br/>
Horizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens<br/>
Don't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgiven<br/>
Like how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen<br/>
B-b-b-b-b-b-but wait<br/>
Just spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet<br/>
This mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife<br/>
Student of the past trailblazing a daze<br/>
Not acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase<br/>
We still the highest of commodity grade<br/>
And you could get it, get it, get it, get it today<br/>
<br/>
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation<br/>
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation<br/>
Rules di nation<br/>
<br/>
This is our generation, generation, uh huh, yeah<br/>
This our generation, generation, uh huh<br/>
This our generation, generation, uh huh
