<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Woo...Grand groove, grand groove <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Rough, rough, rugged<br/>
Tough like a nugget<br/>
Listen to the Abstract Poetic, don't snub it<br/>
The Midnight Marauder is the hype beat arranger<br/>
Don't front on the lyrics or the two cuz it's danger<br/>
Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey<br/>
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky<br/>
I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties<br/>
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny<br/>
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly<br/>
Upset when I rock, cuz yo, they beats is smelly<br/>
See, I got it goin on like a Forbes tax return<br/>
Listenin to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn<br/>
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens<br/>
The skies up above, the one you think of<br/>
Is the highly regarded, hell of the people<br/>
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal<br/>
So if ya wanna do it to yourself<br/>
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself<br/>
Cuz you made your bed, so now you lay in it<br/>
That's your (shit) on the floor, then go and play in it<br/>
I refuse to catch a 'L' in a battle<br/>
Cuz yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's (ass)<br/>
Into little next to nuthin<br/>
Test me if I'm frontin<br/>
I'm passin flyin colors cuz yo...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Q-Tip:]</i> <br/>
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz) <i>[7X]</i><br/>
We've got the jazz<br/>
Come on <br/>
Come on, Phife<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
No need for introductions cuz you know who I be (the Phife Dawg)<br/>
Yep, the one who loves to slaugher MCs<br/>
I got style, grace and razamatazz<br/>
I'm like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo<br/>
I add pizazz, now<br/>
Most people remember Phife from the Phife like smoothness<br/>
But now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness<br/>
I'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw<br/>
The first punk that tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw<br/>
I'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff<br/>
Don't ever try to test or else that (ass) will get whipped<br/>
I'm forever poppin junk, its like a fat invite<br/>
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight<br/>
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2<br/>
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo<br/>
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep<br/>
Cuz it only takes a peek to watch that (ass) get beat<br/>
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some<br/>
Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none<br/>
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with<br/>
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?<br/>
I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?<br/>
But beatin on a woman, is somethin that a puss would do<br/>
I love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid<br/>
Not really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz) <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Come on<br/>
Who got the jazz? (We've got the jazz) <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Come on<br/>
I go...woo...grand groove, grand groove<br/>
Ooh...grand groove, grand groove<br/>
Check it out<br/>
We got the jazz y'all <i>[3X]</i><br/>
<i>[ad lib]</i>
