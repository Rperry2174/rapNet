<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
We can get down<br/>
We can, we can get down <i>[both lines 4X]</i><br/>
Ah, it's like that man, it's like that (yes!)<br/>
It's like that man, it's like that (yes!) <i>[2X]</i><br/>
It's like that man, it's like that <br/>
(<i>[Rakim from "My Melody":]</i> "Why waste time on the microphone")<br/>
Check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife:]</i><br/>
I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow<br/>
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know<br/>
Steppin on my critics, beatin on my foes<br/>
The plan is to stay focused, only then I can go<br/>
Straight from the heart, I represent hip hop<br/>
I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop<br/>
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top<br/>
Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closin the shop<br/>
Crushin competition like your tires on grapes<br/>
My rhymes styles be blendin like a Ron G tape<br/>
My man where ya goin? You can't escape<br/>
When the Tribe is in the house, that means nobody is safe<br/>
How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define<br/>
The music of our youth from 1979<br/>
We rap about what we see, meaning reality<br/>
&gt;From people bustin caps and like Mandela bein free<br/>
Not every MC be with the negativity<br/>
We have a slew of rappers pushin positivity<br/>
Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap<br/>
So Marion Barry smokin crack, let's preach about that<br/>
The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter<br/>
The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter<br/>
When I talk, I know I'm talkin for you poppers all around<br/>
You know you love the sound, we gets down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
I'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream<br/>
I'm the wish you thought inside your dream<br/>
Listen to the way we pulsate the jam<br/>
I'm the nigga here with the mic in hand<br/>
Styles that we present are just a few<br/>
To do away with you and your hum drum crew<br/>
This is '93 and the shit is real<br/>
Black people unite and put down your steel<br/>
Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive<br/>
Devoted to your lover and make it thrive<br/>
The riff was of F, I'm a hip hop body<br/>
Release the energy like the force of a shotty<br/>
Standin on the wall with my Polo on<br/>
Talkin to the girl with the Liz Claiborne<br/>
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack<br/>
Got my Timbo horse and my Doublemint pack<br/>
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul<br/>
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls<br/>
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat<br/>
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap<br/>
I can do a trick with the opposite breed<br/>
I used to down 40s and smoke grain weed<br/>
Now, I'm doin shows with half loot down<br/>
Now it's time for me to take ya uptown<br/>
<br/>
It's like that man, it's like that (yes!) <i>[7X]</i><br/>
It's like this, Shaheed!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shaheed: scratching until end]</i><br/>
