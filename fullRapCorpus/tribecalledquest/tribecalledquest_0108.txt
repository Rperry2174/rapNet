<i>[Jarobi:]</i><br/>
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on<br/>
A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on<br/>
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan<br/>
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand<br/>
Asphalt jumpin', junkie lyrical, concrete<br/>
My Jedi mind be moving me<br/>
Throughout the many dark streets<br/>
Backwoods, boondocks, whatever terrain<br/>
Auf Wiedersehen, Aloha, man our feet ain't the same<br/>
I won't abuse these shoes, these shoes ain't made for reversing<br/>
Then trudging through these motherfuckers' first album Footprinting, never ever ghostwritten, yo' shit free, bitten<br/>
Grab my shit with both hands, iron grip, steel mitten<br/>
Bloviated, Jarobi ate it and now it's gone<br/>
Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead<br/>
To my hustlers with customers, scam my chicks just being petty<br/>
Trap lords with the fetty, don't be no backwards, no<br/>
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no<br/>
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no<br/>
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no<br/>
Don't do it, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
I spun around without a care<br/>
When I stopped, I felt lost<br/>
I'm two heels from the top tier<br/>
Really want to be boss<br/>
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere<br/>
Maybe the answer's not out there<br/>
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere<br/>
When I stopped, I felt lost<br/>
Do you ever feel lost?<br/>
<br/>
They wanna see my downfall<br/>
Turn a good day into a downpour<br/>
Thorns in the crown hit the cross I bear<br/>
Why they wanna see me hangin' like a towel somewhere<br/>
One eye, two bills, three tears, a heart still<br/>
How I'm feelin' in my mind right here<br/>
Think I'm moving, I ain't going nowhere, nowhere<br/>
Maybe why I feel lost, yeah<br/>
How I'm 'posed to know how home feels?<br/>
I ain’t even on my home field<br/>
And again I feel lost<br/>
Was not a cruise that brought us here, again I feel lost<br/>
And I refuse to be stuck right here, yeah<br/>
I don't want to move backwards, no<br/>
Somebody just give me<br/>
Somebody just give me<br/>
Somebody just give me direction?<br/>
I don't want to move backwards, no<br/>
Somebody just give me<br/>
Somebody just give me<br/>
Somebody just give me directions?<br/>
I don't want to move backwards, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Moving backwards never, that was never the plan<br/>
Can I vent? I was content being my own man<br/>
Up until that night ill-fated, walking home I was faded<br/>
Po puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands<br/>
How demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism?<br/>
Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism<br/>
Instead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom<br/>
He'll make it out of the jungle some way<br/>
Hey, it's figurative, not a real place you stay<br/>
Ay, it's mind state filled with muck and malaise<br/>
Uh, I got direction without using Waze<br/>
Submitting myself to praying these days<br/>
Yeah, moonwalking backwards, it's only for stage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak &amp; (Q-Tip &amp; Anderson .Paak)]</i><br/>
Feds lining up in riot gear<br/>
And everybody's hands in the air<br/>
Four-five so get your ass found somewhere<br/>
Caught between hope and despair<br/>
Say it loud, what it take to make my niggas listen<br/>
Somebody just give me<br/>
Somebody just give me<br/>
Somebody just give me<br/>
Cool out, chill out nigga, I'm cool<br/>
Cool out nigga, nah, nigga I'm through<br/>
Head down, ain't no tellin' what you gon' do<br/>
(Somebody just give me—<br/>
Somebody just give me—<br/>
Somebody just give me direction<br/>
I don't want to move backwards, no<br/>
Cops killing us niggas everywhere<br/>
Maybe we should get some guns too)<br/>
She come around every now and a few<br/>
(Man, I hope she really loves you)<br/>
Living high ain't hard to do<br/>
(She'll be in the clouds somewhere<br/>
Feeling fresh, I strut your bitches out of here<br/>
Might even take your broad too<br/>
Oops, I'm 'bout to get kicked out here<br/>
Tell mama I'mma slide through)<br/>
Stealer, I'm trying to get out of here<br/>
But stuck up in the same room<br/>
(Too many open miles in here<br/>
Sick of eating out at drive through)<br/>
<br/>
Hahaha, look at this motherfucker
