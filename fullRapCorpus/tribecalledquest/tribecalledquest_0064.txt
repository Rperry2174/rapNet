<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Doin' our thing in Queens<br/>
We had dreams about bein' emcees<br/>
And there was no concern about so and so<br/>
And these record companies<br/>
But now we all are grown<br/>
And the spots is gettin' blown<br/>
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD<br/>
Nah, we ain't none of them, B<br/>
Give me<br/>
So give me<br/>
Nore, Phife Dawg and Abstract<br/>
Give me<br/>
To everyone in the world<br/>
Nore, Phife Dawg and Abstract<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Noreaga]</i><br/>
Yo when I rap, all my niggas love Abstract<br/>
Yo, from Far Rock to Flushing, concussion<br/>
Every time a nigga rhyme it's like we get our bus' on<br/>
I used to ride a dollar van and really get my bus on<br/>
Yo, from South Don to El Segundo<br/>
All my niggas gettin' high yo, and still livin' on the run though<br/>
Get alot a dough so now we have a lot of fun though<br/>
Q-U, two E's, N-S<br/>
All we really care about is money, cheba and sex<br/>
what what what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
niggas get faded, never outdated<br/>
Give it to the world, 'cause for long they waited<br/>
Shorties online to cop the new CD<br/>
So hip-hop'll bust nut in graffiti<br/>
We could two-piece it or we could just seize it<br/>
Shorty, you're my shit, 'cause my style wild decent<br/>
What's it gonna be, the party or the precent?<br/>
Queens cats rock, keep it rugged and recent<br/>
my nigga Nore thug it out (thug it out, no doubt)<br/>
Phife Dawg buggin' out (buggin' out, no doubt)<br/>
The Love Movement no doubt (Love Movement, no doubt)<br/>
Ali Shaheed get a shout (shout it out, no doubt)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Noreaga]</i><br/>
Yo better things, hold on, take a time out<br/>
Huddle up, yo, Queens niggas won't fuck it up<br/>
Keep my southside niggas just palyin' the cut<br/>
While my Queensbridge people stay roughin' you up<br/>
East Elmhurst, Carona, Iatola<br/>
Keep the caller ID on the Motorola<br/>
Gotta keep the po-po on the payola<br/>
Queens niggas shut it down, now it's all over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i><br/>
One nine two, the Bully fram Lou<br/>
Merrick Van Wig holler Shaft got brew<br/>
Head up Jamacia Ave, cop a tape by DJ Clue<br/>
Move to the acre, sippin' on a guinney booze<br/>
Scoopin' ladies up in babies makes my day complete<br/>
Freestylin' over beats for my peoples in the street<br/>
This is a place where stars are born<br/>
Linden to Lawton, we keep it hot like porn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
