Yeah, Phifeâ€”for your life<br/>
<br/>
Now, in the time when niggas wasn't supposed to be born<br/>
Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn<br/>
Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong<br/>
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass<br/>
Just for running through their lawn<br/>
Walt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt<br/>
Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt<br/>
Love was consummated and the angels registrated<br/>
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it<br/>
Inside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy<br/>
It's a bouncing baby boy, a king's name they would employ<br/>
And before he even squeaks, it's decided it's Malik<br/>
Now give him hope, give him care<br/>
Raise him while his grandma there<br/>
Watch out momma, if you stare<br/>
Light brown eyes'll keep you there<br/>
Let's progress the story just a little bit<br/>
Malik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits<br/>
Sometimes overbearing though I thought it was for your benefit<br/>
Despite all the spats and shits cinematically documented<br/>
The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended<br/>
Rhymes we would write it out, hard times fight it out<br/>
Gave grace face to face, made it right<br/>
And now you riding out, out, out, out, damn<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever loved somebody?<br/>
(Phife dawg, man)<br/>
Way before you got to dream?<br/>
(Bow wow, woof woof)<br/>
No more crying, he's in sunshine<br/>
<br/>
Never thought that I would be ever writing this song<br/>
Hold friends tight, never know when those people are gone<br/>
So, so beautiful, opined indisputable<br/>
Heart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude<br/>
Took me quick to granny house, now we eat the curry food<br/>
Talking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared<br/>
Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of sairs<br/>
Mailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there<br/>
A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn't care<br/>
Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear<br/>
I'mma flash forward well, took a trip to ATL<br/>
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well<br/>
Wedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I'm at<br/>
Standing on the side of black Malik Izaak<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever loved somebody?<br/>
Way before you got to dream?<br/>
No more crying, he's in sunshine<br/>
He's alright now, see his wings<br/>
Have you ever loved somebody?<br/>
Way before you got to dream?<br/>
No more crying, he's in sunshine<br/>
He's alright now, see his wings<br/>
Have you ever loved somebody?<br/>
Way before you got to dream?<br/>
No more crying, he's in sunshine<br/>
He's alright now, see his wings<br/>
Have you ever loved somebody?<br/>
Way before you got to dream?<br/>
No more crying, he's in sunshine<br/>
He's alright now, see his wings<br/>
Have you ever loved somebody?<br/>
Way before you got to dream?<br/>
No more cry
