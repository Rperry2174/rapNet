<i>[Shaheed:]</i><br/>
It's a new decade<br/>
The Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo<br/>
The usual rhythm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Devoted to...the art of moving butts<br/>
The rhythm's happenin, and it's movin up<br/>
The Tribe has been on hold for much too long<br/>
Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong<br/>
On the corners, brothas bop their heads<br/>
&gt;From the high-tops to the knotty dreads<br/>
I'm a nubian y'all, look what we did<br/>
Took the crust away from the third eye lid<br/>
Now, it's kinda open, longs to see the site<br/>
Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed out right<br/>
Night after night, day after day<br/>
Questin for the rhythms of the Native Tongue lay<br/>
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door<br/>
Things a B-boy has never seen before<br/>
Polyrhythmatic with a big fat boom<br/>
You have an eargasm as you start to consume<br/>
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem<br/>
Yeah, it's from the heart, cuz it's from the home<br/>
Jarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed<br/>
Call me Koala, got what you need<br/>
You're a disc jock, then jock this<br/>
Rhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss<br/>
If you feel uptight and you need to freak<br/>
It'll be alright once we drop this beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm <i>[8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip:]</i><br/>
Ma ma sa ah, ma ma coo sa<br/>
Gets hectic, freak a bourgeios<br/>
We Quest around for the musical hard<br/>
On the avenues, streets and boulevard<br/>
Not sellin out, that's a negative<br/>
Lovin hip hop, lovin heritage<br/>
Got the instinct to travel miles and miles<br/>
Gotta whole lot of room for piles and piles<br/>
Now, you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk<br/>
&gt;From the Zulu Nation, toppin all the junk<br/>
Standin on the top like the Temptations said<br/>
Rhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed<br/>
Read what I read, can't be better said<br/>
Tribalic motions dabble in the head<br/>
Sweetback's bad, not as bad a beat<br/>
It's a "stone groove baby"<br/>
Continue, on the windy road<br/>
But, I'm luggin, a crazy big load<br/>
Will we be on point for the ninety deck<br/>
Is it muscle bound and will it flex?<br/>
But trudgin, we are used to<br/>
You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew<br/>
We're four, once more, must make the tracks<br/>
You see four fronts, but now you see four backs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus until end]</i>
