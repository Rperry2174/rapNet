And it's yours<br/>
<br/>
Commentatin', you illustratin,<br/>
All the beautiful things that a baller can go for<br/>
But i'm not that, I don't like to floss<br/>
If you need me in your universe, listen it's yours<br/>
<br/>
Uhuh uh uh...<br/>
<br/>
And it's yours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Do you like this?  Yea<br/>
Do you want this?  Yea<br/>
Well if you had it would you flaunt this?  Hell yea<br/>
Well it's yours<br/>
<br/>
Talkin to a player who's already played can<br/>
Soon lead to boredom and your feelings just may fade<br/>
Never be intrigued by the young boy face<br/>
Look inside me love you see I got wild taste<br/>
I don't really know but<br/>
Somebody said that <br/>
A high-priced girl can really lay in your head<br/>
I don't know<br/>
<br/>
If it's true now, I leave it up to you<br/>
<br/>
Queenstyle, uh, well it's yours<br/>
<br/>
Your style plus angle done up with finesse<br/>
Is rubbing you right and I hope you don't <br/>
Fess<br/>
Now it's time, to introduce<br/>
Myself as Tip so cut the other cats loose<br/>
Listen, I hope you're diggin this tune<br/>
Cause when I get you in a room I'm gonna make you swoon<br/>
A B S T R A C T<br/>
Usually the reason why a lady wants me<br/>
She write down her number, I make impact<br/>
Which only occurs, if the club ain't packed<br/>
So ??? Come on, stop whilin, I got it all fixed<br/>
Just listen to the mix to the mix.....<br/>
<br/>
Break down yall, break it down <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
To da beat, to da beat....<br/>
<br/>
Ali, ali, ali.....<br/>
<br/>
Common talk, deserves a walk,<br/>
While I sit in a range<br/>
Everything he says to you from now on<br/>
Since talkin to me, it all seems strange<br/>
Definitely<br/>
you will agree<br/>
Just let your mind be free<br/>
Relax yourself, I got you now<br/>
Yo, this is the place to be<br/>
<br/>
What what what.....<br/>
<br/>
Romance uh, Romance uh, Romance uh<br/>
<br/>
A cracker jack joint to put on your ring finger<br/>
When you're all alone thoughts of us still linger<br/>
Once the picture is finished, the music ain't done<br/>
The difference is the memories, we had fun<br/>
Cause they'll be plenty of nights, that we can excite<br/>
No other could be me because I shoot the G right<br/>
Frid up some ??? with the collard green special<br/>
It's my crib, I'm Fred and you're Ethel<br/>
Massage your head up with a temple rub<br/>
While we cool and make love to a ???? dub<br/>
It's deeper than the tangible I want in<br/>
Can't you see it in my eyes, it's yours, it's no surprise<br/>
So we takin you back yo<br/>
And we illin on the track yo<br/>
On the dance floor never ever lie<br/>
Here we go one more time uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
