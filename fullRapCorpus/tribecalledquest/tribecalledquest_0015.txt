<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
It's a fly love song<br/>
<br/>
To the effect of nothing, effective fronting<br/>
is what I don't allow so let me tell you something<br/>
I am a bon-a-fide<br/>
Not too modest and not a lot of pride<br/>
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside<br/>
if my momma is sick I'm by her beside<br/>
Used to watch the show on channel 4 called Riptide<br/>
Wash my wears in-Tide cause it's too damn cold<br/>
out-Tide, that's how the runnings go<br/>
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show<br/>
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)<br/>
to the Chemical Bank, and get my cash<br/>
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh<br/>
You best Quest you ask the Quest you ask real fast<br/>
Cause I don't wanna see em, start buckin<br/>
Throwin chairs in the air while you be duckin<br/>
what what?  Don't step to me with that<br/>
If you promotin the show make sure it ain't wack<br/>
<i>[sings]</i><br/>
Or else I'm leaving ("let me tell you")<br/>
I'm leaving (<i>[cut and scratched]</i> "let me tell you")<br/>
I'm leaving (<i>[cut and scratched]</i> "let me tell you")<br/>
Your wack show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> Yo man whassup with that?<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i> Yo don't sweat me...<br/>
... c'mon, five hundred, that was the deal<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> C'mon man, don't try to play me out<br/>
<i>[Phife]</i> We don't need you, sorry!!!<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> You know you need me<br/>
<i>[drum roll]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i><br/>
And the Abstract rapper says<br/>
<br/>
I want chicken, and orange juice, ?dat sauce on my rider?<br/>
And my occasional potato by Oreida<br/>
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty<br/>
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty<br/>
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto<br/>
Took a few shorts before<br/>
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear<br/>
Ain't takin no shorts no more, now<br/>
please act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers<br/>
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no<br/>
Make sure you count your money real slow<br/>
Be alert, look alive, and act like ya know<br/>
It's, the 90's, time to make moves<br/>
Not, the 80's, do away withcha womb<br/>
So what?  You got a crew<br/>
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zoo<br/>
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool<br/>
We don't have to act like we in grade school<br/>
Just make sure that we're taken care of<br/>
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out<br/>
Diggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-a-diddy<br/>
Diggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-a-diddy<br/>
Diggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-a-diddy<br/>
Diggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-diggy-diggy
