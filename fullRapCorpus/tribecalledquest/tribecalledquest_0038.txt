<i>[Verse One: Phife Dawg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo swing swing swing, to chop chop chop<br/>
Yo that's the sound when MC's get mopped<br/>
Don't come around town without the hip in your hop<br/>
Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped<br/>
MC's wanna attack me but them punks can't cope<br/>
I'll have you left without a job, like Isley from The Love Boat<br/>
So money watch your mouth, or I might have to bust ya<br/>
Battlin MC's, from JFK to Russia<br/>
Back down to London, Sweden and Brazil<br/>
Do a U.S. tour for three months and then a chill<br/>
Styles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney<br/>
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney<br/>
"I love you, you love me"<br/>
The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC<br/>
So move back yaself dread, you know the element<br/>
The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutriment<br/>
MC's don't have no winds, MC's don't have no winds<br/>
I flips you crazier than a busload of Jerry's Kids<br/>
Your crew don't want it, man your crew don't want it<br/>
But if you feel you can swing it, then money please bring it<br/>
(sup) Large Professor in the house (sup)<br/>
(sup) You know how we do (sup)<br/>
(sup) I stay on your crew (sup)<br/>
(whassup) like Mario Lemieux (whassup)<br/>
(Whassup?) Peace to Ike Love<br/>
(Sup? Hah hah) and the rest of the crew (Whassup?)<br/>
(Whassup?) I meet you guys in front the cleaners<br/>
Bring the blunts and the brew so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Q-Tip]</i><br/>
<br/>
Whassup kids?  The Ab is speaking from the moon<br/>
Thanks for your support, aiyyo I'll be home soon<br/>
But the only thing I ask when I return from my task<br/>
Is a whole bunch of beats and a Blass full of ass<br/>
My fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid<br/>
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards<br/>
C'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy<br/>
I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy<br/>
She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty<br/>
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty<br/>
When we over joints like this we never cruddy<br/>
Extra P hooked the beat, and kids it feels luh-huh-ovely<br/>
Check it out, cause my conception is immaculate<br/>
A bachelor, lookin for a bachlelorette<br/>
Back to you MC's, this is what your gonna get<br/>
A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette<br/>
I hope you like Malboro, Paul you know we thorough like Denver<br/>
The beat feels like a never-ender<br/>
But all things good must, so I won't sweat it<br/>
Drop the C's for the youthful crew, I hope you get it<br/>
As I stand, grip this mic inside my hand<br/>
Boy I smack you up, like I was your old grand<br/>
so respect yourself Son, and come and gimme love<br/>
Once again the Ab is who you think of<br/>
So chill with the beef money, we got a Jetti<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Extra P (Large Professor)]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's Extra P and yo Tip I'm bout to set it<br/>
on the country once again here to win<br/>
I'm Uptown chillin, takin in this grand master Vic blend<br/>
from the projects, the PJ's, fuck them two DJ's<br/>
Self mission, I had her in the ill position<br/>
Saying "Large youse the soul brother that I'd like to<br/>
eff with for the rest of my life" yeah yeah now check the method<br/>
As I, proceed with what you need like Akinyele<br/>
A whip looks complete when the tires say Firelli<br/>
Funk monkey, one rapper fell off, now he's a junkie<br/>
There's 8 Million Stories in the city it's a pity<br/>
Don't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty<br/>
Shout to the Guru, Primo and Zulu Zulu<br/>
Nation, was on a vacation, in the ghetto<br/>
Yo Ras slow your roll I'm bout to bag this here's metal<br/>
Rapper Nas on topic, seems we gonna rock it<br/>
Queens represent, buy the album when I drop it (drop it)
