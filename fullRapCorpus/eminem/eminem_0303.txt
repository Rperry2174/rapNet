Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak<br/>
When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up<br/>
But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength<br/>
And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up<br/>
And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Eminem]</i><br/>
Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em<br/>
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em<br/>
Cause when I am not, then I'm a stop pinnin' 'em and<br/>
I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem<br/>
Subliminal thoughts, when I'm a stop sendin'<br/>
'em, women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom<br/>
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not<br/>
Get the illin' to stop, amoxacillin's just not real enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: 50 Cent]</i><br/>
Now don't think I won't hit you, cause I'm popular<br/>
I got a P-90-Roog that'll pop at ya<br/>
Catch you slippin' I'm a give ya what I got for ya<br/>
My clip loaded for 16 shots for ya<br/>
Ya'never had a hot gun on ya waist or blood on ya shoes<br/>
Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you<br/>
Homie you ain't been through<br/>
What I been through<br/>
You not like me<br/>
And I'm not like you<br/>
I'm like a animal when I spit it's crazy<br/>
Got semi-autos that put wholes in niggas tryna play me<br/>
One shot is not enough, you need at least an oozie to move me<br/>
After 4 bottles of don<br/>
The kid start feelin' woozie<br/>
I write my life<br/>
You write what you've seen in gangsta movies<br/>
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me<br/>
I find my space at the top<br/>
I got this rap shit locked<br/>
I've never heard of you<br/>
You've heard of me, I'll murder you<br/>
Spit shells at your convertable<br/>
As long as you notice<br/>
Richard Poor hallows still go through ya door<br/>
This is war<br/>
You scared of me<br/>
Your not prepared for me<br/>
The Kid is back<br/>
50 Cent I know you like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Eminem]</i><br/>
The criminal cop killin' hip-hop villiana<br/>
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners<br/>
Your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it<br/>
Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us<br/>
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock,<br/>
Is it a miracle<br/>
Or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up?<br/>
Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot<br/>
Listen up,<br/>
You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Till the roof comes off,<br/>
Till the lights go out<br/>
Till my legs give out<br/>
Can't shut my mouth<br/>
Till the smoke clears out<br/>
And my high burn out<br/>
I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse<br/>
Till the roof comes off<br/>
Till the lights go out<br/>
Till my legs give out<br/>
Can't shut my mouth<br/>
Till the smoke clears out<br/>
Am I high, perhaps?<br/>
I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Eminem]</i><br/>
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin'<br/>
You get when you're real, and you spit and people are feelin' ya shit<br/>
This is your moment,<br/>
And every single minute you get try'n hold on to it<br/>
'cause you may never get it again<br/>
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can<br/>
And when your run is over<br/>
Just admit when it's at it's end<br/>
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in<br/>
I got a list<br/>
Here's the order of my list that it's in -<br/>
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac... <i>[Echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: 2Pac]</i><br/>
Where my thugs at<br/>
Huh, increase the doses, bustin whoever closest<br/>
Thug livin, hell or prison, never losin my focus<br/>
I'm makin money moves manditory<br/>
In a discussion my past records tell a story<br/>
Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin<br/>
Til the cops come runnin, duck in abandoned buildings<br/>
Ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin villain<br/>
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list<br/>
So I laugh til I cry, when the law come get me<br/>
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds<br/>
In a dirty bitch, waitin to trick me, not the life for me<br/>
Livin carefree, til I'm buried - and if they dare me<br/>
I'm bustin on niggaz until they scurry, I'm clearly<br/>
A man of military means in my artillery<br/>
Watchin over me through every murder scene<br/>
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die<br/>
Sellin dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry<br/>
And still, we try to change the past, in vain<br/>
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed<br/>
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin my soul?<br/>
Got tired of small time livin, niggaz tellin me no<br/>
I got MINE, FUCK THEM OTHER SUCKERS, that's the mentality<br/>
Jealous-ass bustaz <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time<br/>
Well here it is nigga here it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: 2Pac]</i><br/>
No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef til I burn<br/>
Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned<br/>
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social<br/>
Niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em<br/>
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu<br/>
Niggaz do unto these snitches, before it's done to you<br/>
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening<br/>
Best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin<br/>
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? Gettin blowed out<br/>
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify<br/>
Strikes, walkin close to my third, I live a trouble life<br/>
And if you dream be a part of my team<br/>
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends<br/>
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Eminem]</i><br/>
Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart, what is he thinkin'<br/>
About to go against me?, smart<br/>
And it's absurd how people hang on every word<br/>
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve<br/>
But I'll never be served, my<br/>
Spot is forever reserved<br/>
If I ever leave Earth<br/>
That would be the death of me first<br/>
'cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could<br/>
Ever be worse that's why I'm<br/>
Clever when I put together every verse<br/>
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like<br/>
I'm an addict<br/>
I rap like I'm addicted to smack,<br/>
Like I'm Kim Mathers<br/>
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles<br/>
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers<br/>
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin'<br/>
At them, the track is on some<br/>
Battlin' rap who wants some static<br/>
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that<br/>
I'm Slim matters<br/>
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Eminem &amp; Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Until the roof, (Until the roof)<br/>
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)<br/>
Until my legs, (Until my legs)<br/>
Give out from underneath me,<br/>
I, I will not fall,<br/>
I will stand tall<br/>
Feels like no one can<br/>
Beat me
