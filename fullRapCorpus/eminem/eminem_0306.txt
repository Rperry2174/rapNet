<i>[Introduction:]</i><br/>
– I remember... the first time I came here, it's been a rough six years,<br/>
And I'm just happy to not be that person anymore and so as my wife.<br/>
Thank you for letting me do this.<br/>
That's all I have to share right now.<br/>
– Is there anyone else who would like to share with us tonight?<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i> Uuh yeah.<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i> My name is Marshall.<br/>
<i>[Crowd:]</i> Hello Marshall.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Yeah...<br/>
It's my life...<br/>
My own words I guess...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?<br/>
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?<br/>
When they know they're your heart<br/>
And you know you were their armour<br/>
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her<br/>
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?<br/>
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?<br/>
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?<br/>
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane<br/>
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"<br/>
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy<br/>
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself<br/>
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself<br/>
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her<br/>
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her<br/>
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy<br/>
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing<br/>
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing<br/>
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"<br/>
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying<br/>
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time<br/>
"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"<br/>
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it<br/>
"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"<br/>
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket<br/>
It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"<br/>
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror<br/>
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em<br/>
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight<br/>
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late<br/>
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door<br/>
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on<br/>
And I'm singing...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat<br/>
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet<br/>
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out<br/>
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd<br/>
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing<br/>
"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"<br/>
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?<br/>
"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'<br/>
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad<br/>
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'<br/>
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin<br/>
"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going"<br/>
"But baby wait,<br/>
"It's too late Dad, you made the choice<br/>
"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"<br/>
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name<br/>
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill<br/>
Yeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real<br/>
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see<br/>
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me<br/>
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it<br/>
Put it to my brain and scream "die Shady" and pop it<br/>
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes<br/>
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'<br/>
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her<br/>
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister<br/>
Almost as if to say..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus/Outro]</i><br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ending:]</i><br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i> Thank you, thanks for letting me share.
