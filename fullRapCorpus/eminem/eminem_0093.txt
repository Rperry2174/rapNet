I don't understand<br/>
Why are you being so mean?<br/>
You're mean mean man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You are just jealous of me<br/>
Cuz you, you just can't do what I do<br/>
So instead of just admitting it<br/>
You walk around and say<br/>
All kinds of really mean things<br/>
About me cuz you're a meanie, a meanie<br/>
But it's only cuz you're<br/>
Just really jealous of me<br/>
Cuz I'm what you want to be<br/>
So you just look like an idiot<br/>
When you say these mean things<br/>
Cuz it's too easy to see<br/>
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Alright listen, I need you to focus<br/>
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important<br/>
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts<br/>
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment<br/>
Now I need you to open your mind-your eyes close them<br/>
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis<br/>
For the next four and a half minutes<br/>
We are going to explore into your mind<br/>
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous<br/>
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?<br/>
Hippity ga-ga boo-boo<br/>
Psych, I'm kidding<br/>
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'<br/>
Ok, now I need your undivided attention<br/>
Sir I have a question<br/>
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension<br/>
From the moment that I enter into the room<br/>
It gets all quiet and whispers<br/>
Whenever theres conversation, why am I always mentioned?<br/>
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me<br/>
Is it just because<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line<br/>
I was going to say something extremely important<br/>
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up<br/>
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't<br/>
That's just what you wanted to hear from me<br/>
Is that I fucked up ain't it?<br/>
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper<br/>
It doesn't take a bunch of takes<br/>
Or me to stand here in this booth all day<br/>
For me to say the truth, ok?<br/>
You're droolin, you have tooth decay<br/>
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting<br/>
What the fuck you eat for lunch<br/>
A bunch of sweets or something, what?<br/>
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?<br/>
Your tooth is rotten to the gum<br/>
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?<br/>
Yes I do sir, what am I on?<br/>
You sir are on truth syrum<br/>
Marshall I'm so jealous of you<br/>
Please say you won't tell nobody<br/>
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified<br/>
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying<br/>
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things<br/>
It's my own insecurity!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Alright now we, we're going to conduct<br/>
That experiment that we were talking about earlier<br/>
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy<br/>
Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?<br/>
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblence here?<br/>
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on<br/>
Now look in this mirror, how about now?<br/>
What do you have in common?<br/>
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em<br/>
You look like I sound like singing about weenies<br/>
Now take my weenie out of your mouth<br/>
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy<br/>
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying<br/>
Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying<br/>
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is<br/>
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges<br/>
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless<br/>
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is tortuous<br/>
My point is this<br/>
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink<br/>
Now I fogot what the chorus is, your just is...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
