<i>[spray can being shook up and sprayed several times]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Remember me? ("Step in, execution")<br/>
Remember me? ("I have no remorse")<br/>
Remember me? ("I'm 'High Powered'")<br/>
Remember me? ("I drop bombs like Hiroshima")<br/>
<br/>
For this one it's the X, you retarded?<br/>
Cause I grab the mic and get DOWN, like Syndrome<br/>
Hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries<br/>
which qualifies me for the term "universal"<br/>
Without no rehearsal, I leak words that's controversial<br/>
Like I'm not, the one you wanna contest, see<br/>
cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch <br/>
that got "Banned From TV" -- heavyweight hitter<br/>
Hit you watch your whole head split up<br/>
Loco-is-the-motion, we comin through<br/>
Hollow tips is the lead, the .45 threw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sticky Fingaz]</i><br/>
Remember me? ("Throw ya gunz in the air!")<br/>
Remember me? ("Slam! Slam!")<br/>
Remember me? ("Nigga 'Bacdafucup'")<br/>
Remember me? ("Chka-chka-Onyx!")<br/>
<br/>
Niggaz that take no for an answer, get told no<br/>
Yeah I been told no but it was more like, "No, no, no!!!"<br/>
Life a bitch that'll fuck you if you let her<br/>
Better come better than better to be a competitor<br/>
this vet is ahead of, <br/>
The shit is all redder, you deader and deader<br/>
A medic instead-a the cheddars and credda <br/>
Settle vendetta one metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto<br/>
Evidence? NOPE! Never leave a shred-of<br/>
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me<br/>
My moms got raped by the industry and made me<br/>
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you<br/>
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total<br/>
Want beef, nigga? PBBT! You better dead that shit<br/>
My name should be "Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit"<br/>
Probably sayin, "He ain't a killer", but I'm killin myself<br/>
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor<br/>
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you<br/>
Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two<br/>
What you wanna do, cocksuckers? We glock busters<br/>
'Til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters<br/>
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us<br/>
I'm gettin wires niggaz wantin me dead, wantin my head<br/>
You think it could be somethin I said? {*echoes*}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Remember me? ("I just don't give a fuck!")<br/>
Remember me? ("Yeah, fuck you too!")<br/>
Remember me? ("I'm low down and I'm shifty!")<br/>
Remember me? ("I'm Shady!")<br/>
<br/>
When I go out, I'ma go out shootin<br/>
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid<br/>
I'm tryin to clear up my fuckin' image, <br/>
so I promised the fuckin critics<br/>
I wouldn't say "fuckin" for six minutes<br/>
(*click* Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)<br/>
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde<br/>
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on<br/>
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin these crazy thoughts<br/>
in my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom<br/>
("Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?")<br/>
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window<br/>
and stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats<br/>
Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen<br/>
with M-16's and ten clips each<br/>
And them shits reach through six kids each<br/>
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?<br/>
FUCK THAT! PBBT! Tou faggots can vanish to volcanic ash<br/>
and re-appear in hell with a can of gas, AND a match<br/>
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at<br/>
(What the fuck you starin at, nigga?)<br/>
<br/>
Don't you remember me?!<br/>
Remember me?!!<br/>
Remember me??!<br/>
REMEMBER ME!!!!
