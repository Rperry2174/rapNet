Yeah, yeah, Follow me, follow me<br/>
Come with me to the dark side of the force<br/>
No man would boldly go to this place<br/>
The devil only knows of this world so dark<br/>
And oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold oh!  <br/>
<br/>
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart<br/>
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't<br/>
Boy you think you're clever don't ya Girl you think you're so smart<br/>
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark<br/>
Stay Wide Awake <br/>
<br/>
A world so dark<br/>
A world so cold<br/>
A world where only some will go<br/>
But not return, when will they learn<br/>
Were do they go god only knows<br/>
Stay Wide Awake<br/>
<br/>
Fe fi fo fum I think I smell the scent of a placenta<br/>
I enter central park it's dark it's winter in December I see my target with my car and park it and approach a tender<br/>
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her<br/>
Sit down beside her like a spider hi there girl you mighta<br/>
Heard of me before see whore your the kinda girl that I'd<br/>
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wida<br/>
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya<br/>
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I mite flip and get a little bit wilder<br/>
Impregnate a lesbian girl now lets see ya have triplets and I'll<br/>
Disintegrate them babies as soon as that out her with formalda-<br/>
Hide and cyanide girl you can try and hide you can try to scream louder<br/>
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta<br/>
Murderin' I'd rather go vrim! vrim! and now you see just how the<br/>
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh<br/>
Shit wait a minute I mean skull my knife seems dull<br/>
Pull another one out, Uh! <br/>
<br/>
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart<br/>
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't<br/>
Boy you think you're clever don't ya<br/>
Girl you think you're so smart<br/>
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark Stay Wide Awake<br/>
<br/>
A world so dark<br/>
A world so cold<br/>
A world where only some will go<br/>
But not return, when will they learn<br/>
Were do they go, god only knows<br/>
Stay Wide Awake <br/>
<br/>
So dark and so cold my friends don't know this other side of me<br/>
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me<br/>
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy<br/>
It's makin' me play hide n' seek like Jason I'm so hungry<br/>
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me<br/>
So patient see I try to be but Gee why does she taunt me<br/>
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep<br/>
And I creep right through the front see<br/>
So blatantly but silently cuz I know that she's sound asleep<br/>
Who's wakin' me so violently and why is he on top of me<br/>
He's rapin' me she try's to scream somebody please get him off me<br/>
He's tapin' me he's biting me he's laughing likes it's funny<br/>
She's scrapin' me she's fightin' me she's scratching like some dumb freak<br/>
Escapin' me no dice ya see I might just be Ted Bundy<br/>
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties<br/>
I'm crazy but it's alright with me man life can be so empty<br/>
Stay away from cuz I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat<br/>
<br/>
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart<br/>
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't<br/>
Boy you think you're clever don't ya<br/>
Girl you think you're so smart<br/>
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark Stay Wide Awake<br/>
<br/>
A world so dark<br/>
A world so cold<br/>
A world where only some will go<br/>
But not return, when will they learn<br/>
Were do they go, god only knows<br/>
Stay Wide Awake<br/>
<br/>
Better try to stay wide awake or you might be found dead by the lake<br/>
Soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul I'm a try to take<br/>
Pray for light today right away why do they try to fight today<br/>
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away<br/>
Now I use power tools how 'bout now are you in the shower<br/>
Scour you for 6 hours till outage your power outlets<br/>
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya<br/>
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there<br/>
Power there's no one fowler bound ya the tub they found ya<br/>
Face down in the tub I drown you with piles of downers around ya<br/>
Such nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower<br/>
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' star wars<br/>
Jabba the Hut be di bye bye, be di bye bye it's time to die die<br/>
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matter<br/>
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya<br/>
Not your everyday Damien bath me in holy water<br/>
Melting like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand<br/>
Where's the thrill in a hunt there's no fun in that here I come with axe<br/>
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' him up with that<br/>
What was that dial 911 someone's comin' in from the back<br/>
<br/>
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart<br/>
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't<br/>
Boy you think you're clever don't ya<br/>
Girl you think you're so smart<br/>
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark<br/>
Stay Wide Awake<br/>
<br/>
A world so dark<br/>
A world so cold<br/>
A world where only some will go<br/>
But not return, when will they learn<br/>
Were do they go, god only knows<br/>
Stay Wide Awake
