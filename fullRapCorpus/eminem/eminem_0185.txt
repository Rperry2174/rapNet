<i>[Eminem - Chorus]</i><br/>
There's no need to say shit you already know<br/>
The question is just how far will this go<br/>
How far will he take it?<br/>
And when will he stop?<br/>
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up<br/>
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not<br/>
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya<br/>
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?<br/>
Man when are you gonna let up<br/>
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better<br/>
<br/>
Holy toledo it's Angelina Jolie amigo<br/>
She told me yo Shady just hand your penis to me I'll deep throat<br/>
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see bro<br/>
Who was a fantasy I don't mean to damage your ego<br/>
You faggots wanna rassle I shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole<br/>
And rope it shut with a lasso<br/>
Couple of crushed lexapro broken up wit the capsule or paxil<br/>
Just incase I ain't dope enough wit the raps though<br/>
Coke is cut with tobacco<br/>
Smoke it up then go wacko<br/>
This is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco<br/>
Shady let go, the hoe has been choked up enough<br/>
Let her ass go<br/>
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole<br/>
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra cuter<br/>
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her<br/>
I'm off my fucking meds but I'm on an electric scooter<br/>
I might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers<br/>
Spit in Jasons face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar<br/>
They can't even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar<br/>
Now I'm gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-<br/>
cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cuz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem - Chorus]</i><br/>
There's no need to say shit you already know<br/>
The question is just how far will this go<br/>
How far will he take it?<br/>
And when will he stop?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.o.B]</i><br/>
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, geez<br/>
There's no need to say shit you already know<br/>
The question is just how far will this go<br/>
Cause I will never lay down?<br/>
And I will never let up?<br/>
(I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.o.B - Verse 2]</i><br/>
With the soul of a Sharman<br/>
I leave the beat than vomit<br/>
Like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach<br/>
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies<br/>
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in<br/>
So can you hear me coming<br/>
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting<br/>
It's probably go diseases on it<br/>
I'm just being honest, I can see the comments<br/>
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it<br/>
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie<br/>
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money<br/>
I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging<br/>
Somebody tell these girls please release my undies<br/>
Nobody really understands my language<br/>
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation<br/>
But still I got a whole lot of patience<br/>
Sittin' back watching Earth from my Space station<br/>
<br/>

Man when are you gonna let up<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Eminem - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bendingfield in a washer<br/>
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle<br/>
Its like I got ya hypnotising like I gotcha<br/>
I gotcha pychologically fucked<br/>
Michael would like an apology what<br/>
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt<br/>
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts<br/>
I'm as cold as a muthafucking icicle on my nut<br/>
I aint nuttin' nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut<br/>
The poster addict for post tramatic stress<br/>
I guess this is the most dramatic I've been in a while<br/>
This is the closest that its come to the Marshall Mathers<br/>
I can hear him start to gather<br/>
I don't paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family<br/>
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny<br/>
Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning<br/>
(He can't say whore)<br/>
Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties<br/>
<br/>
