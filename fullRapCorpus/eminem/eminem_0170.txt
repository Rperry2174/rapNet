(Like a verbal seduction<br/>
Seduction when I tell them girls on the floor)<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, man,<br/>
Just feels like we're a lot different<br/>
Kinda feels like I'm on a whole different page right now than you.<br/>
It feels strange but uh, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I'm morphing into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfing all competitors.<br/>
Better get your girlfriend in check. It's psychological warfare. Endorphins I affect.<br/>
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blasting out your deck, "She loves me".<br/>
Such passion you'd expect this sort of reaction from her. Yet, you strong arm.<br/>
You're fucking corny. You try to turn your charm on. 'cause you just think you're Bishop, the Don Juan.<br/>
But if you think that you're fucking with me, homie you're on one.<br/>
I'm cocking my head back like, "Ed Lover. C'mon son. She's on my Johnson.<br/>
She brings my name up constant." Your boys are like, "She's fucking with dude. She wants him."<br/>
Homeboy, you better get a clue, she's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you. What you expect her to do?<br/>
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track.<br/>
<br/>
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't<br/>
She's been stolen from you<br/>
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't<br/>
She's been stolen from you<br/>
<br/>
She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar.<br/>
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are.<br/>
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car, and I'm in every single slot, and you're not. Aww.<br/>
I'm the logo on that Dallas cowboy helmet: a star<br/>
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable. Naw.<br/>
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up 'cause they're just not good enough.<br/>
But I'm not giving up 'til I get my respect, and I won't stop 'til I get enough,<br/>
'cause I'm not living up to my own expectations. Aww.<br/>
That hater alarm is sounding off, that Obama took the bomb from my name. Aww.<br/>
So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame. Aww.<br/>
You sadly mistaken if you thinking that I'm not on my game, boy.<br/>
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth.<br/>
You wear your heart on your sleeve. I sport that white tank boy.<br/>
But you got a hard on for me. What you hollering my name for?<br/>
It's your bitch on my dick. Ain't my dang fault. Man, I can't call it.<br/>
<br/>
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't<br/>
She's been stolen from you<br/>
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't<br/>
She's been stolen from you<br/>
<br/>
It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear. You hear it girl, come here.<br/>
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier seducing her.<br/>
Loosen up with a little freestyle that'll wait, am I losing you? Am I making you look bad?<br/>
Well I got news for ya, homie, you losing her. Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast.<br/>
Am I trying to show her how? Let me slow it down some. It's still gonna be a blow out.<br/>
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album.<br/>
Rummage through the shit, and try to salvage something to see if you can save any of it,<br/>
Punk but none of it's fucking with me. Prick, you really feeling that bullshit?<br/>
You think you killing them syllables. Quit playing. These beats ain't nothing to fool with.<br/>
They call me Fire Marshall. I shut the shit down.<br/>
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round.<br/>
I am also the opposite of what you are like. You are microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic.<br/>
I am awesome and you are just awestruck. She's love stricken.<br/>
She's got her jaw stuck, from sucking my dick. Aww, fuck.<br/>
<br/>
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.<br/>
She's been stolen from you.<br/>
So don't you seduce at what I do.<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.<br/>
She's been stolen from you...<br/>
<br/>
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.<br/>
She's been stolen from you.<br/>
So don't you seduce at what I do.<br/>
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.<br/>
She's been stolen from you.
