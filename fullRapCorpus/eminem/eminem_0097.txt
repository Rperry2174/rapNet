<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say<br/>
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way<br/>
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one<br/>
Tryna pick myself up where I started from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice]</i><br/>
I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control<br/>
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole<br/>
You should know between us we was like mates to soul<br/>
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes<br/>
You was more so the chalant type, I chose<br/>
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose<br/>
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows<br/>
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll<br/>
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode<br/>
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold<br/>
But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate<br/>
We established this way before we became mates<br/>
So whats required is that you chill with all that fire<br/>
Get your desire when I retire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine<br/>
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine<br/>
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line<br/>
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I used to say I never met a girl like you before<br/>
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are<br/>
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters<br/>
Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers<br/>
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for<br/>
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore<br/>
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours<br/>
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls<br/>
If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad<br/>
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off<br/>
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off<br/>
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on<br/>
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue<br/>
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me<br/>
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly<br/>
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me<br/>
It's true that I got shot in the heart<br/>
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are<br/>
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see<br/>
Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach<br/>
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat<br/>
Before you make a decision that's life altering<br/>
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave<br/>
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stat Quo]</i><br/>
In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch<br/>
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch<br/>
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant<br/>
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this<br/>
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit<br/>
Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick<br/>
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit<br/>
Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss<br/>
We started off closer than close<br/>
But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth<br/>
And the final result, back in that same boat<br/>
I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 cent]</i><br/>
Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"<br/>
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me<br/>
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips<br/>
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick<br/>
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast<br/>
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass<br/>
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline<br/>
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind<br/>
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too<br/>
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?<br/>
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice<br/>
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
