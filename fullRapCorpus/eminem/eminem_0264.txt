<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
If I die young, bury me in satin<br/>
Lay me down on a bed of roses<br/>
Sink me in the river at dawn<br/>
Send me away with the words of a love song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad<br/>
I'm attracted to her, for her attractive ass<br/>
And now we're murderers, because we kill the time<br/>
I knock her lights out and she still shine<br/>
I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave<br/>
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team<br/>
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve<br/>
Young money thieves, steal your love and leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda:]</i><br/>
I like the way you walk and if you're walking my way<br/>
I'm that red bull now let's fly away<br/>
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space<br/>
I let you be the judge, n' n' and I'm the case<br/>
I'm Gudda Gudda I put her under<br/>
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder<br/>
She don't even wonder, coz she know she bad<br/>
And I got her nigga, grocery bag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
If I die young, bury me in satin<br/>
Lay me down on a bed of roses<br/>
Sink me in the river at dawn<br/>
Send me away with the words of a love song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Man, if I could sing. I'd keep singing this song to my daughter<br/>
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father<br/>
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her<br/>
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't...<br/>
Now you probably get this picture from mu public persona<br/>
That I'm a pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama<br/>
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest<br/>
Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside my soul<br/>
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow<br/>
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold<br/>
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breaking<br/>
Should I just give up or live up to these excpetations?<br/>
now look, I love my daughter more than life itself<br/>
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell,<br/>
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt<br/>
So many chances man, it's too bad coulda had someone else<br/>
But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted<br/>
So here's what I'm facing, 3 felonies, 6 years of probation<br/>
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman<br/>
I've taken bats to people's back, bent over backwards for this woman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
If I die young, bury me in satin<br/>
Lay me down on a bed of roses<br/>
Sink me in the river at dawn<br/>
Send me away with the words of a love song
