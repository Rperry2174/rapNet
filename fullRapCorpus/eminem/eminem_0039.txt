<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
When I was just a little baby boy,<br/>
my momma used to tell me these crazy things<br/>
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,<br/>
she used to tell me he hated me<br/>
But then I got a little bit older<br/>
and I realized, she was the crazy one<br/>
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it<br/>
cause that's just the way she was<br/>
<br/>
They said I can't rap about being broke no more<br/>
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more<br/>
(AH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore<br/>
'til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!<br/>
(AH!) These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing<br/>
Thinking I'm saying the shit cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it<br/>
(AH!) Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gonna shoot you<br/>
I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you<br/>
(AH!) Shut up slut, you're causing too much chaos<br/>
Just bend over and take it like a slut, OK Ma?<br/>
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,<br/>
snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"<br/>
You god damn right BITCH, and now it's too late<br/>
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states<br/>
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches<br/>
vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, VRINNN! <i>[*chainsaw revs up*]</i><br/>
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all<br/>
dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on<br/>
Blood, guts, guns, cuts<br/>
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me<br/>
Girls neither - you ain't nothing but a slut to me<br/>
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef<br/>
We ain't gonna never stop beefing I don't squash the beef<br/>
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead<br/>
for popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't said<br/>
But when they kill me - I'm bringing the world with me<br/>
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me<br/>
.. I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)<br/>
Cause Shady, will fucking kill you (ah-ha ha)<br/>
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)<br/>
Cause Shady, will fucking kill you..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you<br/>
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you<br/>
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!<br/>
I'm trying to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em<br/>
I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid<br/>
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added<br/>
WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!<br/>
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again<br/>
Eminem offend? NO! Eminem insult<br/>
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse<br/>
to do it again, THEN, if he does it again<br/>
you'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the 10th<br/>
(Ah!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus<br/>
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest<br/>
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times<br/>
in a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?<br/>
Serial killer hiding murder material<br/>
in a cereal box on top of your stereo<br/>
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine<br/>
out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (first line starts "Or I'ma kill you!")]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Eh-heh, know why I say these things?<br/>
Cause lady's screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams<br/>
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks<br/>
this eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!<br/>
TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things<br/>
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks<br/>
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows<br/>
just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?<br/>
FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer<br/>
from fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her<br/>
from principal to the student body and counselor<br/>
from in-school to before school to out of school<br/>
I don't even believe in breathing I'm leaving air in your lungs<br/>
just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it<br/>
OK, I'M READY TO GO PLAY<br/>
I GOT THE MACHETE FROM O.J.<br/>
I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROAT ACHE<br/>
You faggots keep egging me on<br/>
'til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?<br/>
SHUT UP! Give me your hands and feet<br/>
I said SHUT UP when I'm talking to you<br/>
YOU HEAR ME? ANSWER ME!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[first line starts "Or I'ma kill you!", ninth line starts "Bitch I'ma kill you!"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Ha ha, I'm just playing ladies<br/>
You know I love you
