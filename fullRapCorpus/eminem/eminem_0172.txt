<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
We touch I feel a rush<br/>
We clutch it isn't much<br/>
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us<br/>
It's lust, it's torturous<br/>
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just<br/>
Did the impossible<br/>
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous<br/>
If you fuck me over<br/>
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt<br/>
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you<br/>
And love is "evol"<br/>
Spell it backwards I'll show you<br/>
<br/>
Nobody knows me I'm cold<br/>
Walk down this road all alone<br/>
It's no one's fault but my own<br/>
It's the path I've chosen to go<br/>
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so<br/>
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's<br/>
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?<br/>
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this<br/>
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be<br/>
Like trying to start over<br/>
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster<br/>
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over<br/>
It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you<br/>
You take my breath away<br/>
You're a supernova... and I'm a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon<br/>
And I'm aiming right at you<br/>
Right at you<br/>
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June<br/>
And I'm aiming right at you<br/>
Right at you<br/>
Right at you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'll do whatever it takes<br/>
When I'm with you I get the shakes<br/>
My body aches when I ain't<br/>
With you I have zero strength<br/>
There's no limit on how far I would go<br/>
No boundaries, no lengths<br/>
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's<br/>
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?<br/>
You want them when they don't want you<br/>
Soon as they do feelings change<br/>
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate<br/>
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate<br/>
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take<br/>
Let's cut to the chase<br/>
'Fore a door shuts in your face<br/>
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open<br/>
That I won't be making a mistake<br/>
Cause I'm a...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want<br/>
But I love you so much it hurts<br/>
Never mistreated you once<br/>
I poured my heart out to you<br/>
Let down my guard swear to God<br/>
I'll blow my brains in your lap<br/>
Lay here and die in your arms<br/>
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading<br/>
I'm trying to stop you from leaving<br/>
You won't even listen so fuck it<br/>
I'm trying to stop you from breathing<br/>
I put both hands on your throat<br/>
I sit on top of you squeezing<br/>
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick<br/>
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house<br/>
And let you live<br/>
Tears stream down both of my cheeks<br/>
Then I let you go and just give<br/>
And before I put that gun to my temple<br/>
I told you this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gunshot]</i><br/>
<br/>
And I would have did anything for you<br/>
To show you how much I adored you<br/>
But it's over now<br/>
It's too late to save our love<br/>
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon<br/>
And I'm aiming right at you<br/>
Right at you<br/>
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June<br/>
And I'm so lost without you<br/>
Without you<br/>
Without you
