<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
It's alright, it's OK, I'm gonna make it anyway,<br/>
I'ma make it, I'ma make it, I'ma make it.., somehow...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Sometimes I just feel like, quitting I still might<br/>
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write<br/>
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life<br/>
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics<br/>
And show these people what my level of skill's like<br/>
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life<br/>
Something ain't right, hit the brake lights<br/>
Case of the stage fright, drawing a blank like<br/>
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault<br/>
Breaking eye balls, my insides crawl<br/>
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut<br/>
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's<br/>
just been stripped, I have just been vicked<br/>
So I must then get off the bus then split<br/>
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm going the fuck home<br/>
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan<br/>
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land<br/>
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands<br/>
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back<br/>
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm going<br/>
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone<br/>
ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own<br/>
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I'm walking these train tracks, trying to regain back<br/>
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap<br/>
To the same plant, and the same pants<br/>
Trying to chase rap, gotta move ASAP<br/>
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man<br/>
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand<br/>
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad<br/>
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand<br/>
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad<br/>
Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head<br/>
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had<br/>
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad!<br/>
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet<br/>
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet<br/>
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep<br/>
The pressure's too much man, I'm just trying to do what's best<br/>
And I try, sit alone and I cry<br/>
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by<br/>
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm begging you God<br/>
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job<br/>
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are<br/>
Yo I'm telling you dawg I'm balling this trailer tomorrow<br/>
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye<br/>
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far<br/>
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know<br/>
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow<br/>
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own<br/>
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it<br/>
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest<br/>
To be walking this borderline of Detroit city limits<br/>
It's different, it's a certain significance,<br/>
A certificate of authenticity, you'd never even see<br/>
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility<br/>
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC<br/>
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me<br/>
But yet I'm still unsigned, having a rough time<br/>
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes<br/>
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline<br/>
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go<br/>
Who must I show, to bust my flow<br/>
Where must I go, who must I know<br/>
Or am I just another crab in the bucket<br/>
Cause I ain't having no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it<br/>
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm starting to doubt shit<br/>
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with<br/>
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit<br/>
At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit<br/>
And it's cold, trying to travel this road<br/>
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battling mode<br/>
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want<br/>
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun<br/>
There is no sun, and it's so dark<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart<br/>
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends<br/>
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin<br/>
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not<br/>
What I'm doing I just blow, my head is a stove top<br/>
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot<br/>
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got<br/>
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn<br/>
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned<br/>
Ain't no calling her next time I need a new girl<br/>
I can no longer play stupid or be immature<br/>
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage<br/>
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words<br/>
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge<br/>
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred<br/>
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third<br/>
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird<br/>
Then I turn and cross over the median curve<br/>
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
