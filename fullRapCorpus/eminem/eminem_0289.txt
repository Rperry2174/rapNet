Some days I just wanna up and call it quits<br/>
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks<br/>
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits<br/>
My life's like one great big ball of shit!<br/>
<br/>
If I could just put it all into all I spit<br/>
Instead of always trying swallow it<br/>
Instead of starin' at this wall and shit<br/>
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit<br/>
Can't call it shit!<br/>
<br/>
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall<br/>
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits<br/>
This is it, last straw<br/>
That's all, that's it<br/>
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic<br/>
<br/>
I'm like a skillet bubblin', until it filters up<br/>
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up<br/>
Blow this building up, I've been sealed enough<br/>
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up<br/>
<br/>
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts!<br/>
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts<br/>
Well, Imma show you what, You gon' feel my rush<br/>
If you don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch<br/>
<br/>
Build the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up<br/>
Goosebumps, Yeah Imma make your hair sit up, Yeah sit up<br/>
Imma tell you who I be, Imma make you hate me, Cause you ain't me<br/>
<br/>
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see<br/>
What you close-minded fucks were too blind to see<br/>
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee<br/>
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me<br/>
<br/>
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine<br/>
All I need's a line, but Sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme<br/>
To express how I'm really feeling at that time, Yes<br/>
Sometimes, Sometimes, Sometimes<br/>
<br/>
It's just sometimes it's always me<br/>
How dark can these hallways be<br/>
The clock strikes midnight<br/>
1, 2, then half past 3<br/>
This half-assed rhyme, with this half-assed piece of paper<br/>
<br/>
I'm desperate at my desk<br/>
If I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest, Again<br/>
Stuck in this slump, Can't think of nothing<br/>
Fuck, I'm stumped, Oh, Wait, Here comes something, nope!<br/>
<br/>
It's not good enough, scribble it out<br/>
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw this shit out<br/>
I'm fizzling out, thought I figured it out<br/>
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid? Why am I a slave<br/>
To this Trade ? Cyanide I spit to the grave<br/>
Real enough to rile you up, Want me to flip it? I can rip it<br/>
any style you want.<br/>
<br/>
Imma switch hitter bitch Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter<br/>
Imma sit here till I get enough of me to finally hit a fucking boiling point<br/>
Put some oil in your joints, Flip the coin, Bitch come get destroyed<br/>
<br/>
An MC's worst dream, I make them tensed, they hate me<br/>
See me and shake like a chain-link fence<br/>
By the looks of 'em you would swear that Jaws was coming<br/>
By the screams of 'em you would swear I'm sawing someone<br/>
<br/>
By the way they runnin', you would swear the law was coming<br/>
It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothing<br/>
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, He said he'd be back<br/>
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest<br/>
<br/>
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock<br/>
Fuck this clock! Imma make them Eat this watch<br/>
Don't believe me Watch! Imma win this race<br/>
And Imma come back and rub my shit in your face, Bitch!<br/>
<br/>
I found my niche, You gon' hear my voice<br/>
'Til you're SICK of it, you ain't gonna have a choice<br/>
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung<br/>
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it, Rabbit Run!
