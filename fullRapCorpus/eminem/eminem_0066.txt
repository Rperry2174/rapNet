Em, it's Paul.<br/>
Listen, Joel just called me and he said you're in the fucking back behind his studio,<br/>
shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range.<br/>
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home.<br/>
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.<br/>
Don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you.<br/>
Leave your fuckin gun at home.
