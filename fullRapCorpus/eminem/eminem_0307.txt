<i>[Hook: Anna]</i><br/>
Keep on going, you just gotta fight it<br/>
Keep on going cause it's not too late<br/>
You can't back down, you can't back down<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy<br/>
Are they asking me that because of the shit thats been thrown at me<br/>
or am I just a little snappy<br/>
and they genuinly care<br/>
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there<br/>
and I continuosly stare at pictures of you<br/>
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do<br/>
yeah I say it now and you can't hear me<br/>
what the fuck good does that do me now<br/>
but somehow I know you're near me in presence<br/>
or I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them<br/>
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little<br/>
and dawg you'll never believe this<br/>
but Sharonda actually talks to me now<br/>
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces<br/>
man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us<br/>
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different<br/>
if its true, how the fuck am I supposed to get over you<br/>
difficult as it sounds<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Doody, thats what we call eachother<br/>
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us<br/>
we was always brothers<br/>
never thought about eachothers skin colours<br/>
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer<br/>
it was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn<br/>
tryna walk under the trees<br/>
just to give me some comfort<br/>
I'm moaning I just wanna get home<br/>
when I look over and his shirt is off<br/>
I'm like you gon fry and like<br/>
"No I wont, I'm black stupid<br/>
black people they got melatonin<br/>
in their skin, we don't burn"<br/>
meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt<br/>
like I'm on fire<br/>
and the entire time you're just laughing at me<br/>
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard<br/>
and I still have to get you back for that shit<br/>
and by the way them playboy rings<br/>
my mother stole from you<br/>
well Nate finally got em back shit<br/>
it must have been at least 16 years ago<br/>
well I put em in your cask-owww<br/>
moving past it, it still aint registered yet<br/>
but you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget<br/>
the motor city mo-town<br/>
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads<br/>
it don't stop there<br/>
yeah, as difficult as it sounds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Anna]</i><br/>
Keep on going, you just gotta fight it<br/>
Keep on going cause it's not too late<br/>
You can't back down, you can't back down<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
and this may sound a little strange but I'mma tell it<br/>
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding<br/>
and I picked it up to smell it<br/>
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass<br/>
and hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it<br/>
and as for all of me and D12 we feel like fuck rap<br/>
it feels like our General just fucking died in our lap<br/>
we shut off all our pages,<br/>
all our cell numbers is changed<br/>
our two-ways are in the trash<br/>
so some cats will have to find a new way<br/>
and I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today<br/>
but the truth is there all still here and you ain't<br/>
purple gang, you gotta pressing on<br/>
don't ever give up the dream dog<br/>
I got love for you all<br/>
and Doody, it's true you bought people together who never<br/>
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you<br/>
you were the peacemaker Doody<br/>
I know sometimes you were moody<br/>
but you hated confrontation<br/>
and truly hated the feuding<br/>
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping<br/>
if it had to happen, it had to happen<br/>
believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to<br/>
throw them balls back on Dresden<br/>
from making cars to paintballing<br/>
getting arrested<br/>
to sitting across from eachother in cells laughing and jesting<br/>
they tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question<br/>
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up<br/>
didn't show up for court<br/>
so we got off on a technicality, left sweating<br/>
me, you and whats his face<br/>
I forgot his fucking name<br/>
shame he even came to your funeral<br/>
he betrayed our team<br/>
and if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fucking face<br/>
and thats on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name<br/>
I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air<br/>
for you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot of 54<br/>
just before we were supposed to get in cars<br/>
to come and see you once more<br/>
difficult as it sounds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Anna]</i><br/>
Keep on going, you just gotta fight it<br/>
Keep on going cause it's not too late<br/>
You can't back down, you can't back down<br/>
<i>[4x]</i>
