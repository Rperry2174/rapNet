<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
You can even call me cold<br/>
These bitches know as soon as they saw me<br/>
Its never me to get the privilege to know<br/>
I roll like a desperado<br/>
Now I never know where I'm gonna go<br/>
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow<br/>
Until its over and its all she wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,<br/>
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape<br/>
Cupid shot his arrow and missed<br/>
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.<br/>
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face<br/>
Nights over goodbye, hoe<br/>
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over<br/>
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover<br/>
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,<br/>
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,<br/>
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.<br/>
She must've took me for some high roller.<br/>
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)<br/>
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.<br/>
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya<br/>
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars<br/>
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly<br/>
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
You can even call me cold<br/>
These bitches know as soon as they saw me<br/>
Its never me to get the privilege to know<br/>
I roll like a desperado<br/>
Now I never know where I'm gonna go<br/>
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow<br/>
Until its over and its all she wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Man TIP told me on this hoe tip<br/>
Best tip I could give you to hip you<br/>
Never let these traits trick you<br/>
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit<br/>
Dig you a hole<br/>
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch<br/>
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you<br/>
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns<br/>
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool<br/>
I'm chillin like a Villain<br/>
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles<br/>
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you<br/>
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch<br/>
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you<br/>
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you<br/>
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle<br/>
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue<br/>
there's a bombshell, scud missile<br/>
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you<br/>
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud<br/>
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle<br/>
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle<br/>
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
You can even call me cold<br/>
These bitches know as soon as they saw me<br/>
Its never me to get the privilege to know<br/>
I roll like a desperado<br/>
Now I never know where I'm gonna go<br/>
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow<br/>
Until its over and its all she wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP<br/>
And each one thinks "Say this shit"<br/>
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief<br/>
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine<br/>
Let em get a good taste of it<br/>
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now<br/>
But in case you didn't<br/>
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it<br/>
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it<br/>
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker<br/>
That clock come racing in double time<br/>
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time<br/>
It may take you pricks to catch on<br/>
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong<br/>
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog<br/>
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong<br/>
But if you gonna tell me that the A&amp;W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
You can even call me cold<br/>
These bitches know as soon as they saw me<br/>
Its never me to get the privilege to know<br/>
I roll like a desperado<br/>
Now I never know where I'm gonna go<br/>
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow<br/>
Until its over and its all she wrote
