<i>[Just Blaze - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Some people ask me, where I’ve been lately<br/>
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me<br/>
I play in the background, I don’t back down<br/>
So don’t get it twisted, tryna play me<br/>
First I come out, they underate me<br/>
Then I come back, still try to fade me<br/>
They say I’m nasty, say I’m crazy<br/>
Ask what I think, I say maybe<br/>
I fly away<br/>
It ain’t nothin’ in my way so I may aswell fly away<br/>
It ain’t nothin’ else to say so I may aswell fly away<br/>
I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today<br/>
Cos I’ve been to the top and there’s nowhere else to go<br/>
The only way to see me is if you lookin’ up from down below<br/>
And there’s nothin’ else to say so I may aswell fly away<br/>
And there’s nothin’ in my way so I may aswell fly away<br/>
I’m on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem - Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up<br/>
I’ma step up on the stage now, I’m gonna strut<br/>
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt<br/>
And you aint gotta tell me notin’ boy, get off of my nuts<br/>
It goes one for the money, two for the show<br/>
My shit don’t stink, I dont think so<br/>
Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll<br/>
Are you ready now, here we go<br/>
The bald eagle has landed<br/>
I’m back in ya hair, sorry for leavin’ you stranded<br/>
Im twice as dread and evil and rancid<br/>
They cant sit, I don’t think anybody understands it<br/>
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough<br/>
I aint got to play though, they say I died in a fatal<br/>
Car crash, shows what they know<br/>
Shit if I did, it’d be a trailer not a car<br/>
The white trash star<br/>
I fuckin RV up like Brett Favre<br/>
Homie you got it backwards, your dippin your soup inside ya crackers<br/>
I can carry rap til my back hurts<br/>
Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors<br/>
Get my back right<br/>
Now I’m right back on you bastards<br/>
I was chasin’ the dragon, I dont know what happened<br/>
It was like the feelin’ I had when I first started rappin’<br/>
I just could’nt seem to get back and recapture that magic<br/>
So I went back to the lab, thats where I’ve been at when...<br/>

<i>[Eminem - Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I took a hiatus haters now I’m back to cause trouble<br/>
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles<br/>
Im the *bang* you aint fuckin sick<br/>
The hospital won’t even give you cough drops for course cocksucker<br/>
You think your hot, you aint even luke warm<br/>
My pubes hotter than you<br/>
Your soft I use fire to cool me off<br/>
I told em I’ll grow up one day and show ‘em I’d be able to choke clouds<br/>
Pick up lightenin’ bolts and throw ‘em<br/>
Take the world by storm with these words I form<br/>
Georgie porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for em<br/>
Make ‘em swarm, make ‘em fight over the shirts I’ve worn<br/>
Sworn over my sweat towels, its mind blowin<br/>
Yes Im livin’ the dream homie, cant nothin’ compare<br/>
I’m so up, I’m stuck in mid air I’m lovin’ it yeah<br/>
Its like these people are steps now, all they do is stare<br/>
These haters is so pussy they’re afraid to be scared<br/>
This is pay back, like I owe ‘em back pay<br/>
They spat in my face, now I’m back to do them the same exact way<br/>
And leave this rap game with a bad taste,<br/>
And slap it back out, before I step back out of this crap thanks<br/>
Slap me now I’m slapping ‘em back hey! fuck it we’ll slap back<br/>
But yeh okay now we’ll talk cause I’m smack ay<br/>
And I aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack<br/>
How’s that for hindsight, what the track say?<br/>
<br/>
