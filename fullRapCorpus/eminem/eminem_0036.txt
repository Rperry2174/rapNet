<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..<br/>
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death<br/>
I don't want to die yet<br/>
A lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..<br/>
that I do all types of.. retarded shit<br/>
Look, I can't change the way I think<br/>
And I can't change the way I am<br/>
But if I offended you? Good<br/>
Cause I still don't give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
I'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo<br/>
Hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint<br/>
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?<br/>
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this<br/>
Livin amuk, never givin a fuck<br/>
Gimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck<br/>
But I smoke dope in a cab<br/>
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab<br/>
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (YEAH!)<br/>
A killer instinct runs in the blood<br/>
Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud<br/>
I've calmed down now -- I was heavy once into drugs<br/>
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz<br/>
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn<br/>
The rest of my body's still bein operated on<br/>
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme<br/>
Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
For all the weed that I've smoked - yo this blunt's for you<br/>
To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!<br/>
To all the friends I used to have - yo I miss my past<br/>
But the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS<br/>
For all the drugs that I've done - yo I'm still gon' do<br/>
To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!<br/>
For everytime I reminisce - yo I miss my past<br/>
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can KISS MY ASS<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you<br/>
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue<br/>
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles<br/>
And pull you apart from both angles<br/>
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins<br/>
And bust open like broken water mains<br/>
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb <br/>
Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm<br/>
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm<br/>
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb<br/>
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on<br/>
And the pants to match ("Here momma try em on")<br/>
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,<br/>
a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives<br/>
(Shittin on rappers) Causin hospital accidents<br/>
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it<br/>
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Ohh shit!)<br/>
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?<br/>
I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet<br/>
Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches<br/>
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches<br/>
I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches <br/>
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes<br/>
Never ran with a click - I'm a posse<br/>
Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me<br/>
From the second I was born, my momma lost me <br/>
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy<br/>
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place <br/>
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday<br/>
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?<br/>
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
