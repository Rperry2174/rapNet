<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,<br/>
Feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.<br/>
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength<br/>
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up<br/>
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B/W Intro:]</i><br/>
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left<br/>
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left<br/>
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left<br/>
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse #1:]</i><br/>
Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em<br/>
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them<br/>
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop pinning 'em<br/>
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.<br/>
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom<br/>
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.<br/>
Amoxacillin is just not real enough.<br/>
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.<br/>
You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.<br/>
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.<br/>
For shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out<br/>
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.<br/>
Till the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps<br/>
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.<br/>
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out<br/>
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.<br/>
Till the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps<br/>
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse #2:]</i><br/>
Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when you're real<br/>
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.<br/>
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it<br/>
'cause you may never get it again.<br/>
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can<br/>
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.<br/>
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.<br/>
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.<br/>
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.<br/>
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.<br/>
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.<br/>
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.<br/>
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me<br/>
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse #3:]</i><br/>
Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart<br/>
What is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.<br/>
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.<br/>
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve<br/>
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved<br/>
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.<br/>
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.<br/>
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse<br/>
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict<br/>
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.<br/>
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles<br/>
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.<br/>
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them<br/>
The track is on some battling raps who want some static<br/>
'Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters<br/>
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest. So...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Eminem &amp; Nate Dogg Echo:]</i><br/>
Until the roof<br/>
The roof comes off<br/>
Until my legs<br/>
Give out from underneath me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I will not fall,<br/>
I will stand tall,<br/>
Feels like no one can beat me.
