Mr. Berman? What?!<br/>
We have Eminem here to see you <br/>
<br/>
about fuckin' time!<br/>
Send him in (Steve! Good to see ya man) <br/>
Look who decided to show his face!<br/>
I hope you've had fun in the last 4 years. <br/>
(Look man, I apologise again for-) <br/>
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?<br/>
(Again, it was a mistake,) (a terrible mist- are you wearing a bulletproof vest?) <br/>
and then you go and you do what? hide out? stay in Detroit from us 5 years while the music industry melts the fuck down?<br/>
Do you know how many people lost their jobs because of your fuckin vacation?<br/>
(Well that's actually why I'm here, I was gonna, put out some new music and I wanted to play it for you, and get your opinion) <br/>
Do I really need to hear it?<br/>
Let me guess, another album about poor me, I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life, and I'm such a tortured artist.<br/>
Let me make music about it and my tragic love life, am I on to something here? (Come on man it's not like that yo-) <br/>
You know what? Just hand the fuckin thing over I'm done talkin to you. Think you can just come and go as you please.<br/>
Big selfish superstar (Steve, I had a drug problem) <br/>
Oh poor me, I had a drug problem.<br/>
Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town? You know what? <br/>
<br/>
(Hey! hey!) Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out (Woah, woah, woah. Jesus Christ man!)<br/>
(Alright alright here, fine) What's this shit? Two CD's? <br/>
(That's what I've been tryin to tell you man, there's 2 albums)<br/>
Just get out! (Alright!) <br/>
Get the fuck out (Alright man, see you later)
