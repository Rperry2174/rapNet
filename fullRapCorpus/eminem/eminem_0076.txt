<i>[body]</i><br/>
it doesnt take much<br/>
for me to raise such a stink up<br/>
when motherfuckers hate your guts<br/>
you aint even gotta say much<br/>
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers<br/>
like smearing blood stains with a paint brush<br/>
i cant explain what it is my brain does<br/>
but however it works its insane<br/>
its plain nutz<br/>
and it aint just my brain thas dangerous<br/>
its a whole combination of things<br/>
it takes nutz<br/>
and im not affriad to raise the stakes up<br/>
i got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks<br/>
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us<br/>
im patiently waiting for the day<br/>
im anxious<br/>
to see the look on ya fake mugs<br/>
when you thugs go bankrupt<br/>
ya drunk<br/>
ya aint tough<br/>
whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas<br/>
this is me talking motherfucker<br/>
this aint drugs<br/>
you wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up<br/>
FUCK THAT<br/>
its too late chump now face up<br/>
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does<br/>
opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off<br/>
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off<br/>
so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw<br/>
and give him the surgery that he came for<br/>
till i pull the paint off<br/>
i never been shot<br/>
but i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth<br/>
cause ive always came off<br/>
like ja's chain<br/>
when they try to rush him and lost<br/>
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it<br/>
i dont stop<br/>
the only thing i wait for<br/>
is day that i dont gotta report to probate court<br/>
cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more<br/>
cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw<br/>
alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja<br/>
and ima read that motherfucker off from april<br/>
you pussies think i went soft since 8 mile<br/>
when i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls<br/>
trust me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
monkey see monkey do<br/>
dont ever make the first move<br/>
just let em' come to you<br/>
cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do<br/>
so let em' come to you<br/>
the rest of us follow suit<br/>
monkey see monkey do<br/>
tweedle-de-tweedle-dum<br/>
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come<br/>

check-mate motherfucker<br/>

<i>[outro]</i><br/>
