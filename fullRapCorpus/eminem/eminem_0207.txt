<i>[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]</i><br/>
Mom, I know I let you down<br/>
And though you say the days are happy<br/>
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?<br/>
And, Mom, I know he's not around<br/>
But don't you place the blame on me<br/>
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nate Ruess]</i><br/>
I guess we are who we are<br/>
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on<br/>
Maybe we took this too far<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Eminem]</i><br/>
I went in headfirst<br/>
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse<br/>
My mom probably got it the worst<br/>
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are<br/>
Did I take it too far?<br/>
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs<br/>
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,<br/>
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom<br/>
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam<br/>
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare<br/>
And forever we can drag this on and on<br/>
But, agree to disagree<br/>
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me<br/>
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)<br/>
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats<br/>
Why we always at each other's throats?<br/>
Especially when dad, he fucked us both<br/>
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)<br/>
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings<br/>
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road<br/>
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load<br/>
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,<br/>
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable<br/>
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Eminem]</i><br/>
'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though<br/>
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow<br/>
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry<br/>
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,<br/>
'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes<br/>
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio<br/>
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home<br/>
And all the medicine you fed us<br/>
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,<br/>
But now the medications taken over<br/>
And your mental state's deteriorating slow<br/>
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though<br/>
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo<br/>
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both<br/>
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours<br/>
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,<br/>
'cause one thing I never asked was<br/>
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was<br/>
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address<br/>
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus<br/>
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas<br/>
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses<br/>
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them<br/>
And although one has only met their grandma once<br/>
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers<br/>
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you<br/>
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me<br/>
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,<br/>
And I saw your headlights as I looked back<br/>
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad<br/>
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet<br/>
I guess I had to get this off my chest,<br/>
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead<br/>
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing<br/>
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar<br/>
'Cause you're my Ma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Nate Ruess]</i><br/>
I want a new life (start over)<br/>
One without a cause (clean slate)<br/>
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)<br/>
Well, no matter what the cost<br/>
And if the plane goes down<br/>
Or if the crew can't wake me up<br/>
Well, just know that I'm alright<br/>
I was not afraid to die<br/>
Oh, even if there's songs to sing<br/>
Well, my children will carry me<br/>
Just know that I'm alright<br/>
I was not afraid to die<br/>
Because I put my faith in my little girls<br/>
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."<br/>
Just know that I'm alright<br/>
I am not afraid to die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I want a new life
