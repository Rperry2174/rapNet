Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>

<br/>
Man, I got everything candy-painted<br/>
Candy-painted tint, shit's so dark<br/>
I'd be lying if I said I ain't hit<br/>
at least nine of my friends<br/>
Plus, I got so much candy paint in my rims<br/>
Paint be flyin' off my car<br/>
Be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids<br/>
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland<br/>
Ask about me, man, they be like, there go the candy man<br/>
I park the car in the garage and go in and<br/>
Come back the next mornin'<br/>
The rims are still spinnin'<br/>
Hit the wheels on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile<br/>
32-inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels<br/>
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain<br/>
Custom everything, what's that on the seat?<br/>
Custom mustard stain<br/>
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball<br/>
Get out the car, they be like, "Ah, there go them superstars!"<br/>
Hit every single store, flash a fucking wad of cash<br/>
but I ain't buying shit, bitch<br/>
Kiss my candy-painted ass<br/>
We...<br/>
<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
B-ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Hit the corner liquor store<br/>
To get Corona, tip the owners<br/>
Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up<br/>
And I'ma hit the cinema and I'ma get the hoes,<br/>
When I be it, I be it, shit, anything goes<br/>
I'm ballin' out of control, girls know I'm loaded with dough<br/>
But, shit, I'm stingy as fuck<br/>
I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes<br/>
These bitches don't get a crumb, and it come<br/>
but I'm like what up<br/>
Shut up, bitch, sit up, get up off them knees<br/>
My candy paint's enough<br/>
If you're lucky, I'll let you hug me, but that's all you get<br/>
Then I'ma split, disappear, a cloud of smoke is all you see<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
B-ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>

<br/>
Bitch, get the fuck out my car if we ain't finna fuck<br/>
I'm horny as fuck, bitch, are you suckin' my dick or what?<br/>
I'll fuck a chick in the butt, I really don't give a shit<br/>
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a bitch?<br/>
You fuckin' keyed up my Benz<br/>
Bitch, I beat up my friends<br/>
Don't think I won't beat a bitch<br/>
I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs<br/>
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat<br/>
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat<br/>
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?<br/>
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks<br/>
I fuckin' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me<br/>
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV?<br/>
Turn around and use it on me<br/>
You tryna snort on my keys?<br/>
You fuckin' broad, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me,<br/>
Tell your momma I'ma drop you off at the hospital later<br/>
We finna make this run<br/>
Take this gun and cover me, Slater<br/>
And quit your...<br/>
<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
Ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
B-ballin' Uncontrollably<br/>
