<i>[Girl]</i> Yeah, hahahaha...whooooo, shit!<br/>
<i>[Em]</i> (aight)<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Guess what? I ain't coming in yet...<br/>
I'll come in a minute<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Ayo...This is my love song...it goes like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark<br/>
This is how we used to make the party start<br/>
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark<br/>
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk<br/>
And by the, sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl<br/>
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf<br/>
And my pre-diction is you're gonna probably fall<br/>
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall<br/>
And everything's spinning<br/>
You're beginin' to think women<br/>
are swimming in pink linen again in the sink<br/>
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished<br/>
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches<br/>
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'<br/>
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you<br/>
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'<br/>
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up<br/>
<i>[Em's spaceman voice]</i>Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot<br/>
Looking at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it<br/>
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'<br/>
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it<br/>
Let me out of this place<br/>
I'm outta place<br/>
I'm in outer space<br/>
I've just vanished without a trace<br/>
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow<br/>
I'll be back in an hour or so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
'Cause every time I go to try to leave<br/>
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve<br/>
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay<br/>
These drugs really got a hold of me<br/>
<br/>
'Cause every time I try to tell them "no"<br/>
They won't let me ever let them go<br/>
I'm a sucker all I gotta say<br/>
These drugs really got a hold of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
In third grade, all I used to do<br/>
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubic's cube<br/>
17 years later I'm as Rude as Jude<br/>
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs<br/>
I've got no game<br/>
And every face looks the same<br/>
They've got no name<br/>
So I don't need game to play<br/>
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want<br/>
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want<br/>
However, I do show some respect to few<br/>
As ecstasy got me standing next to you<br/>
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you<br/>
We just met<br/>
But I think I'm in love with you<br/>
But you're on it too<br/>
So you tell me you love me too<br/>
Wake up in the morning like "yo, what the fuck we do?"<br/>
I gotta go bitch<br/>
You know I have stuff to do<br/>
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you<br/>
But in the long run<br/>
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later<br/>
But fuck it, I'm on one<br/>
So let's enjoy<br/>
Let the X destroy your spinal cord<br/>
So it's not a straight line no more<br/>
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls<br/>
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur<br/>
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more<br/>
So bye for now<br/>
I'm going to try to find some more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow<br/>
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow<br/>
And tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again<br/>
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it<br/>
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?<br/>
And what's a little fight?<br/>
Tomorrow you'll be boys again<br/>
It's your life<br/>
Live it however you wanna<br/>
Marijuana is everywhere<br/>
Where was you brought up?<br/>
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going<br/>
'Cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going<br/>
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring<br/>
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning<br/>
But you're young<br/>
You've got a lot of drugs to do<br/>
Girls to screw<br/>
Parties to crash<br/>
Sucks to be you<br/>
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't<br/>
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't<br/>
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated<br/>
Did better drugs and updated<br/>
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do<br/>
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew<br/>
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40<br/>
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories<br/>
With a bottle of Jack<br/>
Two grandkids in my lap<br/>
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<i>[Same as previous, but 2nd time the last line is repeated like this]</i><br/>
<br/>
Drugs really got a hold of me<br/>
They really got a hold of me<br/>
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me<br/>
They really got a hold of me
