<i>[Bridge - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Feels like a close, it's coming to<br/>
Fuck am I gonna do?<br/>
It's too late to start over<br/>
This is the only thing I, thing I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is<br/>
Find different ways to word the same, old song<br/>
Ever since I came a long<br/>
From the day the song called "Hi, my Name Is" dropped<br/>
Started thinkin' my name was fault<br/>
Cause any time things went wrong<br/>
I was the one who they would blame it on<br/>
The media made me the, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan<br/>
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog<br/>
Gangsta? Nah, courageous balls<br/>
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft<br/>
And I sound like AZ &amp; Nas, out came the claws<br/>
And the fangs been out since then<br/>
But up until the instant that I went against it<br/>
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought<br/>
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught<br/>
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered<br/>
I just wanna' play my part, should I make waves or not?<br/>
So back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on<br/>
I don't wanna' seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon<br/>
But sometimes you gotta' take a loss<br/>
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off<br/>
Keep pluggin', it's your only outlet<br/>
And your only outfit so you know they're gonna' talk about it<br/>
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah<br/>
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times<br/>
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?<br/>
What I really wanna' say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story<br/>
Bet 'cha feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are<br/>
When I was afraid ta'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Sia:]</i><br/>
I was a... afraid to make a single sound<br/>
Afraid I would never find a way out<br/>
Afraid I'd never be found<br/>
I don't wanna' go another round<br/>
An angry man's power will shut you up<br/>
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love<br/>
Run out of excuses for everyone<br/>
So here I am and I will not run<br/>
Guts over fear (the time is near)<br/>
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)<br/>
For all the times I let you push me round<br/>
And let you keep me down<br/>
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Feels like a close, it's coming to<br/>
Fuck am I gonna do?<br/>
It's too late to start over<br/>
This is the only thing I, thing I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents<br/>
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?<br/>
And the pain spawns all the anger on<br/>
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on<br/>
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit<br/>
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off<br/>
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part<br/>
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"<br/>
Haters started to appreciate my art<br/>
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused<br/>
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?<br/>
And the lights go out in that trailer park?<br/>
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows<br/>
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from<br/>
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun<br/>
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song<br/>
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh<br/>
And I don't wanna' seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs<br/>
My demise and my uprise, pray to God<br/>
I just opened enough eyes later on<br/>
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make ya' strong<br/>
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt<br/>
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt<br/>
Just havin' to balance my dang self<br/>
When on eggshells I was made to walk<br/>
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the<br/>
Strength to cause Shady-mania,<br/>
So when they empty that stadium<br/>
'Least I made it out ta that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done<br/>
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted<br/>
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song<br/>
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more<br/>
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk,<br/>
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off<br/>
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone<br/>
And to think I was a...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Sia:]</i><br/>
I was a... afraid to make a single sound<br/>
Afraid I would never find a way o-o-out<br/>
Afraid I'd never be found<br/>
I don't wanna go another round<br/>
An angry man's power will shut you up<br/>
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love<br/>
Run out of excuses for everyone<br/>
So here I am and I will not run<br/>
Guts over fear (the time is near)<br/>
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)<br/>
For all the times I let you push me round<br/>
And let you keep me down<br/>
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear
