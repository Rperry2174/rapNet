A drop in the ocean a change in the weather,<br/>
I was praying that you and me might end up together.<br/>
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,<br/>
But I'm holding you closer than most'cause you are my heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man<br/>
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann<br/>
I'm wonderin' why she "ret to go" like Wanda then<br/>
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man<br/>
Now you in the field runnin' plays like Donovan<br/>
McNabb before you get in a cab<br/>
I'll trade in my cab<br/>
Just to take you back to last summer, man<br/>
You don't remember when you was my sweetest<br/>
You don't remember when I called you Reese's Pieces<br/>
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what<br/>
She turned around and giggle said; "You so nuts!"<br/>
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up<br/>
Like how ya ex girl get the new numba<br/>
The rumors was so numerous<br/>
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up<br/>
And that's why<br/>
<br/>
A drop in the ocean a change in the weather,<br/>
I was praying that you and me might end up together.<br/>
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,<br/>
I was praying that you and me might end up together.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
So young, so full of life and vibrant,<br/>
Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,<br/>
So close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shit,<br/>
When Ronnie died you was right by my side,<br/>
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,<br/>
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,<br/>
You even had the same type of childhood I did,<br/>
Sometimes I just wanna know why,<br/>
Is it that you surcame to yours,<br/>
And mine I survived it,<br/>
You ran the streets I nine to fived it,<br/>
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us,<br/>
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,<br/>
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,<br/>
Much as your pride tries to hide it,<br/>
You're cold your touch, its like ice,<br/>
And your eyes is the look of resentment,<br/>
I can sense it and I don't like it<br/>
<br/>
A drop in the ocean a change in the weather,<br/>
I was praying that you and me might end up together.<br/>
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,<br/>
I was praying that you and me might end up together.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, stuck alone in this wave race<br/>
Say I'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace<br/>
Got one foot on the gas, it's never a need for brakes<br/>
Smoke ez-rider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state<br/>
Valet bringing my cars, waiter bringing me plates<br/>
Shrimp and fillet Mignon, we celebrate buying drinks<br/>
Wit a couple of broads my nigga's who got love for me<br/>
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company<br/>
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, I'm a stand out<br/>
And view my life through this lens to see how it pan's out<br/>
Substitute teacher ass nigga's, need a handout<br/>
Middle finger screaming fuck them nigga's who hated,<br/>
I'm money affiliated<br/>
Pop another bottle, that chronic smokin degraded<br/>
Speculating me landing must of got me mistaken,<br/>
I'm speaking as the captain of the planes,<br/>
You's a runner on the jet way<br/>
<br/>
A drop in the ocean a change in the weather,<br/>
I was praying that you and me might end up together.<br/>
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,<br/>
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
