<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Welcome to Detroit<br/>
This is the BET Shady 2.0 Cypher 2011<br/>
Myself, Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf<br/>
<br/>
White dog, get em!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Yelawolf:]</i><br/>
Put these muthafuckas in a box and I send ‘em away<br/>
Put 'em in a gray 'Lac and pop the trunk<br/>
Hey throw 'em in the back, jack, I dig ‘em a grave<br/>
Put a brick inside that Xerox, when I print ‘em a page<br/>
Moving keys I can't relate, cause I live in a cage<br/>
I throw up the A, I take ‘em to school,<br/>
I give em a grade, an easy E for effort<br/>
That's WWA, white with an attitude<br/>
Alphabet soup is on my plate<br/>
All I got is Z’s they sleeping on me, I can’t get ‘em awake<br/>
I spoon feed them the sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns<br/>
Who believe they making it rain cause all they see is the clouds<br/>
And I watch from the couch of the VIP<br/>
Like a potato with a bunch of meatheads like fuck it<br/>
I just feed em a cow<br/>
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year<br/>
But before you can pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater<br/>
Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic<br/>
But what it's like to pick a fight with me<br/>
It’s like putting Nikes on a cheetah, betta speed up<br/>
Or at least in my case Addidas<br/>
I'm out this bitch drinking Sprite by the 2 liter<br/>
Holler, Shady records<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joe Budden:]</i><br/>
Say I’m from the new school, I’ma say check ya tone and watch ya mouth<br/>
If they teaching how to dougie, I’m condoning dropping out<br/>
Forced to wile, y'all birthed and gave me up<br/>
I just perfected being hip hops foster child, now check it<br/>
I don’t blame y’all for being trash fans and copping it<br/>
The radio’s the crime scene the masses are the hostages<br/>
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fan would dodging it<br/>
I’m grown, I ain't watching the throne, I’m sabotaging it<br/>
You see that four headed monster and the storm looms<br/>
Snipe ‘em from a distance, the scope got a long zoom<br/>
You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room<br/>
Got a figure here you won’t get bigger if you on shrooms<br/>
Was left to me I'd revive what the game be ’bout<br/>
I’da took the wine outta Amy house<br/>
Enough raps from you scrub cats about cocking a snub back<br/>
Wayne couldn’t teach me how to love that<br/>
But I got this shit from uptown, she my summer bunny<br/>
Both parents broke but she comes from money<br/>
Think my bread is her paper to burn<br/>
So I lock her out and now she doubt David is Stern<br/>
She so bad I make her hit the telly from a taxi<br/>
Then dead her in that Holiday Inn<br/>
Learnt that from Max B<br/>
That's why the haters of every kind wanna send me Llamas<br/>
I made it right before they eyes like I was Benihanas<br/>
Is it me? Or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?<br/>
Airwaves the same now the stereo’s typical<br/>
My skin thick so the critics ignore<br/>
So unafraid to die you think I did it before<br/>
The boys Rodman with the trash talk<br/>
Magical walk with the black ball way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws<br/>
Glass jaw, hoody and mask would be the black folk with no passport<br/>
Body be found in the mansion in one of my trap doors<br/>
If pumps had awards ya status whore category<br/>
Probably be that of awards 'tween Michael Rappaport and Kenny Lattimore<br/>
I know hip hops alive and well<br/>
If it died, you other crews wouldn’t survive the smell<br/>
<br/>
(Ladies &amp; Gentlemen... you're scared now)<br/>
(Make that face at 'em dawg)<br/>
(Crooked I.. get 'em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Crooked I:]</i><br/>
I spot a victim, the plot’ll thicken when the clock is tickin'<br/>
I caught em slippin', I gotta give em a shot, I hit em with proper spittin'<br/>
Hottest writtens and compositions, so competition's a contradiction<br/>
Somebody mentioned they got it crooked, highly fiction,<br/>
We probably different, got Gotti henchmen,<br/>
Opposition our body quick as Bugatti engines<br/>
I’m on a mission to get richer,<br/>
The sickest lyric kicker diggin' a ditch for different spitters<br/>
Sweet lyricists get disfigured, sip liquor<br/>
Spit like a sick mixture<br/>
Of Notorious Pun and L get the big picture<br/>
The poster I’ll roast ya,<br/>
My mind so deadly it’s just like the beanie is close to a holster<br/>
It’s over control my whole coastal region like I’m supposed to<br/>
Flow is going postal evening, open season<br/>
Heart close to freezing, ruthless is easy nigga<br/>
Approach I’m squeezing, believe me<br/>
Dopest West Coaster  breathing<br/>
So most y'all hope I’m vegan, no pun, beefing<br/>
Rappers need to keep it trill<br/>
Give me a beat to kill too many people still eating sleeping pills<br/>
People sleeping on my ether skills<br/>
And y'all ain't even real<br/>
We about to die in this cypher<br/>
Before you die you should do the Jada and leave a Will<br/>
Foreal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joeel Ortiz:]</i><br/>
Yaooowa<br/>
I ain't a rap dude, I’m a dude who rap<br/>
Before this I was moving crack<br/>
Killers y’all become when y’all rhyme, I salute and dap<br/>
And if I blink then remove ya snaps, you ain't cool you wack<br/>
With ya foolish yac’s? skinny jeans don't mean ya ass shoot<br/>
It means ya booty claps<br/>
Don’t play like Tyler Perry, this the Slaughterhouse of Pain<br/>
Flow brown, tight and heavy<br/>
When it comes to sixteen’s I’m a fiend feinding a studio<br/>
Near a needle with a mean lean, probably writing bars to Nas "Thief theme"<br/>
Getting my Yaowa on, may all the Olajuwon’s be the dream team<br/>
This is an all day slaughter<br/>
They feindin for us to break like Beyonce’s water<br/>
The four quarters doing all the eating<br/>
And you gotta know why I made the cut, I’m Puerto Rican<br/>
Ortiz keep the fire ready<br/>
And tryna put me out’s like tryna steal a transvestite from Eddie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce Da 5'9':]</i><br/>
I’m do or die dope<br/>
And you can make the sticker sittin' on the door<br/>
Of that phantom your suicide note<br/>
Hi Rihanna..<br/>
Is Nicki living with you? Let me know<br/>
So I can buy binoculars and telescopes<br/>
Hi Rihanna..<br/>
I don’t need to know you better<br/>
You tell me you love my music again, we go together<br/>
Bye Rihanna...<br/>
Now back to y’all fools<br/>
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school<br/>
Thousand dollar frames, I prefer to see the world through<br/>
Don’t ask me nothing bout Budden, I beat my girl too<br/>
You ask me why do I keep her? I say it’s cheaper to<br/>
That’s why I ride around in a Rolls like Wiz Khalifa do<br/>
Rappers, I’m your daddy, I tell you straight as this<br/>
You don’t kill but your father Will like Jaden Smith<br/>
I tell ya like I tell my Spanish chick<br/>
You fly but I ain’t going down on no landing strip<br/>
So get your wax on like Daniel-son<br/>
Or I’ma have to run like De La Hoya in drag when cameras come<br/>
Point out the greatest rapper alive I headshot ‘em<br/>
Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom<br/>
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife<br/>
While I’m cyber sexing with Jessica Alba, via Skype<br/>
I’m on my d-boy, d-bo thing<br/>
Spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green<br/>
Get out the camera with yo B Roll bling<br/>
You know your flow is whack<br/>
We cornered the market like a Wal-Mart in a cul-de-sac<br/>
Yeah, this what 2 million singles sold and a album that’s gold<br/>
Look like, without having to sell your soul<br/>
Nickle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Wait, can I rap?<br/>
<br/>
(You da Boss, you better get 'em)<br/>
<br/>
Ayo... lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal subliminal<br/>
In your swimmin' pool<br/>
<br/>
(Boo.. come on man, get back on.. kick that shit)<br/>
<br/>
You ’bout to see peace destroyed<br/>
It’ll never be restored<br/>
When I unleash these beastly hoards on your CD stores<br/>
Wanna stop it, you gon' need a priest and at least three swords<br/>
A license to ill from the Beastie Boys, 3 Ouija boards<br/>
And a squeegee and please be warned don’t ask for the squeegees for<br/>
Or the holy water, acid rap that’ll eat these floors<br/>
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns?<br/>
And as for me, you ask when I’m gone "will he be mourned?"<br/>
Is puke luke warm? Should Casey Anthony do porn?<br/>
Can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a freakin' shoebox<br/>
With a shoehorn, smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on?<br/>
Can she duct tape and Velcro a fetus? Joell yo,<br/>
Tell Joe I need his empty box from his old shell toe adidas<br/>
So I can put these babies in the fetal position,<br/>
They’re getting elbows to the penis<br/>
Yeah, big deal. I took some little kids big wheel<br/>
And spit in his fricken big kids meal<br/>
Quit tryna bite me and pinch, you wench, sit still<br/>
You just put your six inch heel through my Benz windshield?<br/>
Is it dust we bout to kick up?<br/>
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup?<br/>
Between a stick shift in his fricken pick up<br/>
And drink like a hick, redneck, hillbilly will till he gets hiccups?<br/>
Flippin' the script up like Mike Vick<br/>
Get bit in his junk by a pit, yup I’m a sick pup<br/>
I’d be a horrible magician<br/>
Cause I’d fuck that trick up<br/>
Fix ya lips up to say something fly, or zip up<br/>
A-B? Let’s C. You said you were gonna do X-Y-Z<br/>
Till you fuck around and get dropped like an E<br/>
When you add an I-N-G<br/>
Don’t put a K in front of that though, when I MC<br/>
Cause I’m not the king of this microphone booth<br/>
It’s more like a phonebooth<br/>
Superman in this bitch, kryptonite won’t do<br/>
It gives me more power, I bump the fat boys and<br/>
Eat rat poison, take meteor showers<br/>
Fresh outta the mental hospital and me not flossing a middle finger<br/>
While I hop in a mosh pit, will be like Nas doing gospel or R&amp;B, you crazy?<br/>
Me pushing up daisies? That thought is impossible<br/>
As if flashing across the news, Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute<br/>
With a huge Johnson, boobs, and a monstrous tube of lube<br/>
And a bra, some boots, some panties, in an aqua blue Mazda<br/>
Swallowing a popsicle, playing tonsil pool<br/>
So kill the rumors it ain’t happenin'<br/>
I’ma rap till I’m fossil fuel
