<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Boy meets girl,<br/>
You were my dream my world,<br/>
But I was blind,<br/>
You cheated on me from behind.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause boy meets girl,<br/>
You were my dream my world,<br/>
But I was blind,<br/>
You cheated on me from behind.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Eminem]</i><br/>
Now I know we said things,<br/>
Did things that we didn't mean,<br/>
And we fall back into the same patterns,<br/>
Same teams,<br/>
But your tempers' shit just bad as mine,<br/>
You're same as me,<br/>
But when it comes to love you just as blinded.<br/>
<br/>
Baby please come back,<br/>
It wasn't you,<br/>
Maybe it was me,<br/>
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems,<br/>
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano,<br/>
All I know is I love you too much,<br/>
To walk away doe.<br/>
<br/>
Come inside,<br/>
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk,<br/>
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?,<br/>
Told you "this is my fault",<br/>
Look me in the eyeball,<br/>
Next time I'll miss to let my fist hit the dry wall,<br/>
Next time-,<br/>
There won't be no next time,<br/>
I apologize even though I know it's lies,<br/>
I'm tired of the games,<br/>
I just want it back,<br/>
I know I'm a liar,<br/>
If she ever tries to fucking leave again,<br/>
Ima fucking tie her to the bed...<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]</i><br/>
Listen,<br/>
I'm sitting lookin out the window like, "Damn",<br/>
Tryna fix the situation that's at hand,<br/>
You're still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be,<br/>
Me, you're gonna be mine when I'm knowing that you couldn't be.<br/>
<br/>
Cuz you haven't called,<br/>
I ain't even appalled <br/>
I still got a lot of pain,<br/>
I ain't dealt with it all,<br/>
I've been runnin around with other chicks,<br/>
I'm single and they lovin it,<br/>
I'm likin it but I just want the one that I was in love with.<br/>
<br/>
It's not the end of it,<br/>
I'm tryna let you go,<br/>
I can't,<br/>
Get a grip of that I'm tryna let you know<br/>
<br/>
You got hold some kind of control of me,<br/>
I don't know what it is,<br/>
But I gotta get you goin for me,<br/>
<br/>
I'm working at it,<br/>
It ain't getting no better,<br/>
I'm just tryna be like,<br/>
"Yeah, whatever, forget it."<br/>
Instead of starin out this glass,<br/>
Lookin at this bad weather,<br/>
Damn, I gotta pull myself together,<br/>
Cuz.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Drake]</i><br/>
It sounds like a conversation,<br/>
It's a celebration,<br/>
Lets toast to the fact I moved out my mamas basement,<br/>
To a condo downtown,<br/>
Cuz it's all about location,<br/>
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life,<br/>
You shoulda been here to kick it with me, <br/>
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,<br/>
But now I'm at the 40/40 gettin bitches tipsy,<br/>
Killin shit that ever so talented Mr. Riply,<br/>
<br/>
How did I go from bein a man that you argued with?,<br/>
To meeting Dwayne Carter and putting alcohol an shit,<br/>
Should wanna go back to the one I started with,<br/>
But I'm addicted to this life,<br/>
It's gonna be hard to quit.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,<br/>
You can tell me that you've none of my songs,<br/>
As long as you say one day you plan to listen,<br/>
Cuz what's a star...<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
