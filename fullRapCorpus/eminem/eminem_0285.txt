<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Oh no what’s happening to my brain<br/>
I can’t believe this is happening again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Lava out my lips I flips<br/>
Wake up think I have a cramp<br/>
I’m trying to shove the lava lamp up my father’s ass<br/>
I think I’m out of gas, man<br/>
I think I need another mask<br/>
I’d ask my mother but I think she’s laughing at the plants<br/>
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp’s<br/>
I think I’ll eat some Ambiens like they’re candied yams<br/>
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack<br/>
Abrafuckingcadabra motherfucker look who’s back<br/>
Just like a pendulum, Satan’s pentagram swings<br/>
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing<br/>
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing<br/>
While I was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring<br/>
First I Re-up, then I Relapse<br/>
Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc<br/>
And I’ll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle<br/>
Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see Nyquil<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Oh no<br/>
Here we go again<br/>
When it’s going to end<br/>
Where did it begin<br/>
Maybe way back when<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Into the well, baby Jessica fell<br/>
She may have wetted herself<br/>
Quit playing, get her some help<br/>
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail<br/>
Every day in journals saying how<br/>
She wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo<br/>
I’m the medicine man<br/>
My medical marijuana was prescribed by a doctor<br/>
Shove a typewriter up her<br/>
Perez Hilton’s ass, shit, almost forgot that<br/>
He’s always shoving something up his ass so why not that?<br/>
And f-ck it while I’m venting let’s shove a vending machine<br/>
Up his rear end when he’s bending over pretending that he<br/>
Didn’t say anything that would be offending to me<br/>
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G<br/>
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?<br/>
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there<br/>
Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard’s bare<br/>
Stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Vicodin’s like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin<br/>
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again<br/>
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again<br/>
Who am I kidding? I couldn’t quit this shit if my life depends<br/>
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then<br/>
Yeah, rehab’s nice, I had my name up in lights again<br/>
You see that’s why I can’t decipher what life I’m in<br/>
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then<br/>
It sounds so enticing, isn’t it nice when I’m hype again?<br/>
I’m nice when I’m like this, no time to write just type it in<br/>
If I could get my pen to slow down, what’d I write just then?<br/>
Man I’m about to hyperventilate, I just have hyper-tension<br/>
I have the type of mental state you couldn’t comprehend<br/>
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I’m your friend<br/>
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence<br/>
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again<br/>
<br/>
