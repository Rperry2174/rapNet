"So let's get down to business<br/>
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[scratching]</i> What is this? what is this?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
The Invasion! (Invasion yeah)<br/>
Green Lantern! the infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Eminem]</i><br/>
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit<br/>
D-Tweezy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice!<br/>
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name<br/>
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Eminem]</i><br/>
Whoa, here we go, I should've' known<br/>
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit<br/>
Sooner or later you little haters<br/>
Are too jealous of us to love us<br/>
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming<br/>
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach<br/>
50 percent of it's 50 cent<br/>
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is<br/>
But if you even considerin' taking our label down<br/>
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it<br/>
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it<br/>
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit<br/>
Cause then it's gonna get to the point<br/>
Where it escalates to some other shit<br/>
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to<br/>
"Stomping in my Air Force Ones"<br/>
But you won't be able to tell<br/>
If it's two pairs or it's one<br/>
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you<br/>
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe<br/>
I don't know what it is or what it could be<br/>
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me<br/>
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me<br/>
Y'all tickle me pink<br/>
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me<br/>
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety<br/>
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy<br/>
Mixed with a little bit of the<br/>
Jigga-Ja-Jigga<br/>
Wit a small pinch of Biggie<br/>
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
We the realest label<br/>
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label<br/>
Cause we gonna fuck around and kill your label<br/>
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50<br/>
We the label for sure!<br/>
<br/>
We the realest label<br/>
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label<br/>
Cause we gonna fuck around and steal your paper<br/>
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50,<br/>
We gonna kill your fuckin' label for sure!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Shady in the place to be see<br/>
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!<br/>
Still watch what you say to me punk<br/>
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months <i>[gun cocked]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Haha, Shady Records<br/>
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't<br/>
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!<br/>
Cause we do and we see y'all<br/>
We just gonna sit back for a minute<br/>
While I see what the FUCK y'all do
