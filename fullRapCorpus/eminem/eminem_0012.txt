Warning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted<br/>
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted<br/>
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"<br/>
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted<br/>
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises<br/>
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis<br/>
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful<br/>
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo<br/>
"Murder Murder Redrum"<br/>
Brain size of a bread crumb<br/>
Which drug will I end up dead from<br/>
Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated<br/>
"How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?"<br/>
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter<br/>
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder<br/>
Jumped out (Ahhhh!) killed the bitch and did her<br/>
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er<br/>
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler<br/>
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler<br/>
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler<br/>
Didn't Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem + (Redman Sample) - 2X]</i><br/>
<i>[E]</i> I'm low down and I'm shiftee!<br/>
"And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him<br/>
and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from.."<br/>
<br/>
I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons<br/>
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds<br/>
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits<br/>
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits<br/>
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it<br/>
I'ma let your grandpa hit it<br/>
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it<br/>
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum<br/>
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum<br/>
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage<br/>
Losing all of my leverage<br/>
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich<br/>
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage<br/>
Smoked out like Eckridge<br/>
Band just making my neck itch<br/>
What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch<br/>
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast<br/>
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips<br/>
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips<br/>
Slap hips, support domestic violence<br/>
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence<br/>
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?<br/>
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling<br/>
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England<br/>
I'm out the game, put the second string in<br/>
This Brandy got my swinging<br/>
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin<br/>
Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English<br/>
Make your mama be like "Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?"<br/>
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it<br/>
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit."<br/>
It was predicted by a medic<br/>
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic<br/>
Living off liquid Triametic<br/>
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing<br/>
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin<br/>
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue<br/>
I think I'm dying, God is that you?<br/>
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP<br/>
Take me to ER ASAP for and IV<br/>
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop<br/>
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac<br/>
It's politics, it's all a fix<br/>
Setup by these white blue collared hicks<br/>
Just to make a dollar off of black music<br/>
With a subliminal ball of tricks<br/>
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
