America, hahaha, we love you, how many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful<br/>
Country of ours, the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect,<br/>
The women and men who have broke their neck's for the freedom of speech the United States<br/>
Government has sworn to uphold, or<br/>
(Yo', I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) so we're told...<br/>
<br/>
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see,<br/>
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me, who share the same views<br/>
And the same exact beliefs, it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me, so many lives I<br/>
Touch, so much anger aimed, in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays, and straight<br/>
Through your radio waves it plays and plays, 'till it stays stuck in your head for days and<br/>
Days, who would of thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide,<br/>
Reaching for a t-shirt to wear, that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this, how<br/>
Could I predict my words would have an impact like this, I must've struck a chord, with somebody<br/>
Up in the office, cause congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nuthin' but problems, and now<br/>
They're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life,<br/>
And now I'm dumping it on...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
White America, I could be one of your kids, white America, little Eric looks just like this,<br/>
White America, Erica loves my shit, I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get, white America, I<br/>
Could be one of your kids, white America, little Eric looks just like this, white America, Erica<br/>
Loves my shit, I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get...<br/>
<br/>
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself, if they were brown, Shady lose, Shady<br/>
Sits on the shelf, but Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimple's would help, make ladies swoon<br/>
Baby, {ooh baby}, look at my sales, let's do the math, if I was black, I would've sold half, I<br/>
Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that, but I could rap, so fuck school,<br/>
I'm too cool to go back, gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at, when I was<br/>
Underground, no one gave a fuck I was white, no labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was<br/>
Like, fuck it, until I met Dre, the only one to look past, gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up<br/>
Under his ass, helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got, was probably his in<br/>
Exchange for every white fan that he's got, like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at<br/>
Shit, wow, I'm like my skin is it starting to work to my benefit now, it's...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids, who otherwise would of never knew these words<br/>
Exist, whose mom's probably would of never gave two squirts of piss, 'till I created so much<br/>
Motherfuckin' turbulence, straight out the tube, right into your living room I came, and kids<br/>
Flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre, that's all it took, and they were instantly hooked<br/>
Right in, and they connected with me too because I looked like them, that's why they put my<br/>
Lyrics up under this microscope, searchin' with a fine tooth comb, its like this rope, waitin'<br/>
To choke, tightening around my throat, watching me while I write this, like I don't like this,<br/>
Nope, all I hear is, lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working 'round the clock, to<br/>
Try to stop my concerts early, surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston,<br/>
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom, so now I'm catchin' the flack<br/>
From these activists when they raggin', actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch, or<br/>
Say faggot, shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the posterchild, the motherfuckin'<br/>
Spokesman now for...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
So to the parents of America, I am the derringer aimed at little Erica, to attack her<br/>
Character, the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns, sent to lead the march right up to<br/>
The steps of congress, and piss on the lawns of the White House, to burn the casket and replace<br/>
It with a parental advisory sticker, to spit liquor in the faces of in this democracy of<br/>
Hypocrisy, fuck you Ms. Cheney, fuck you Tipper Gore, fuck you with the freest of speech this<br/>
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have, fuck you, <i>[vocal melody]</i>,<br/>
He, hahaha, I'm just playin' America, you know I love you...
