I never knew I..<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
Mic check one-two<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
Who woulda knew?<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
Who'da known?<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
Fuck would've thought<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
Motherfucker comes out<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
and sells a couple of million records<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling<br/>
I never knew I..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I don't do black music, I don't do white music<br/>
I make fight music, for high school kids<br/>
I put lives at risk when I drive like this {*tires screech*}<br/>
I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!)<br/>
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now<br/>
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out<br/>
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out<br/>
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?<br/>
Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?<br/>
Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?<br/>
Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around<br/>
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out<br/>
(Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up<br/>
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?<br/>
<i>[*ewwww*]</i> Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts<br/>
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up<br/>
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor<br/>
Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement<br/>
(The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace<br/>
You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big<br/>
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid<br/>
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist<br/>
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch<br/>
I never knew I, knew I would get this big<br/>
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid<br/>
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist<br/>
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch<br/>

So who's bringin the guns in this country? (Hmm?)<br/>
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London<br/>
And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie<br/>
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi<br/>
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,<br/>
screamin "Go," with their 17-year-old Uncle<br/>
I'm like, "Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads<br/>
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"<br/>
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear<br/>
What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?<br/>
(Hmm?) So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words<br/>
when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse<br/>
("Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!")<br/>
And fuck was the first word I ever learned<br/>
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)<br/>
So read up, about how I used to get beat up<br/>
peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months<br/>
My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)<br/>
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike<br/>
So how much easier would life be<br/>
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I never knew I.. knew I'd..<br/>
have a new house or a new car<br/>
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are<br/>
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?<br/>
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)<br/>
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves<br/>
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)<br/>
How many retards'll listen to me<br/>
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a<br/>
teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?<br/>
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"<br/>
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?<br/>
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been<br/>
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought<br/>
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought<br/>
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop<br/>
I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
How the fuck was I supposed to know?
