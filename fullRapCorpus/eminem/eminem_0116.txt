<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
May I have your attention please?<br/>
May I have your attention please?<br/>
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br/>
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br/>
We're gonna have a problem here..<br/>
<br/>
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before<br/>
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door<br/>
And started whooping her ass worse than before<br/>
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)<br/>
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,<br/>
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"<br/>
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!<br/>
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)<br/>
Feminist women love Eminem<br/>
<i>[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]</i><br/>
"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him<br/>
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what<br/>
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"<br/>
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose<br/>
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms<br/>
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't<br/>
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose<br/>
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"<br/>
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss<br/>
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids<br/>
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is<br/>
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is<br/>
By the time they hit fourth grade<br/>
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?<br/>
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals<br/>
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes <i>[SLURP]</i><br/>
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes<br/>
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope<br/>
<i>[*EWWW!*]</i> But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote<br/>
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus â€“ Eminem (repeat 2x):]</i><br/>
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady<br/>
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br/>
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,<br/>
Please stand up, please stand up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;<br/>
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!<br/>
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?<br/>
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me<br/>
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"<br/>
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?<br/>
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?<br/>
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs<br/>
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst<br/>
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first<br/>
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV<br/>
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"<br/>
I should download her audio on MP3<br/>
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD <i>[AHHH!]</i><br/>
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me<br/>
So I have been sent here to destroy you <i>[bzzzt]</i><br/>
And there's a million of us just like me<br/>
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me<br/>
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me<br/>
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you<br/>
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room<br/>
The only difference is I got the balls to say it<br/>
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all<br/>
I just get on the mic and spit it<br/>
And whether you like to admit it <i>[*ERR*]</i> I just shit it<br/>
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can<br/>
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums<br/>
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty<br/>
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting<br/>
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens<br/>
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working<br/>
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking<br/>
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings<br/>
<i>[*HACH*]</i> Or in the parking lot, circling<br/>
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"<br/>
With his windows down and his system up<br/>
So, will the real Shady please stand up?<br/>
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?<br/>
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control<br/>
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Ha ha<br/>
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us<br/>
Fuck it, let's all stand up
