<i>[20 seconds of background noise]</i><br/>
"It fits, perfect"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Better watch out, sucka now I gotcha where I want ya<br/>
Onslaught, comin and I'm packin in my lunch up<br/>
Bunch of, missile launchers and a bunch of contra-<br/>
-band, van full of ganja, now come on jump<br/>
Man stop, mashin Marshall on my gotcha<br/>
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quadra-<br/>
-plegic, boogeyin down to Frank Sinatra<br/>
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya<br/>
Who'da knew the buddah do to me what it's done<br/>
Such cynicism when this isn't in my system<br/>
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips son<br/>
So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump<br/>
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks<br/>
"Mister, help me" 's what he said to me and then sunk<br/>
Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks<br/>
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill<br/>
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill<br/>
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts<br/>
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts<br/>
Man you don't want to go up in those hills<br/>
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills<br/>
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill<br/>
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways<br/>
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space<br/>
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place<br/>
Hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?<br/>
Well fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait<br/>
Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe<br/>
After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint<br/>
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't<br/>
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin<br/>
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within<br/>
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummagin<br/>
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want to skin<br/>
Been, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end?<br/>
Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win<br/>
Severin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb<br/>
Pull the lever then, trapdoor, death is evident<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin so chill<br/>
Fuckin whore you better fuckin hold still<br/>
Make sure none of that, lotion in the bucket don't spill<br/>
Cut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffin those girls<br/>
Man I think she had enough of those pills<br/>
Sedate her then I'll wait, I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel<br/>
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal<br/>
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you!<br/>
I keep hearin voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife<br/>
And push it right through her while you put ya shish-kabob skewers<br/>
Into her, barbecue her or would you do to her<br/>
What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?<br/>
<i>[as Yoda]</i> "In a world of sin you are, this is turnin into a<br/>
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!"<br/>
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya<br/>
Boo-yah, who ya think you're fuckin with; duck because here he comes again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
