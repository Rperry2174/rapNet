<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
This motherfucker man, just won't shut up will you?<br/>
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me<br/>
I'm promoting you right now<br/>
Man lets put the nail in his coffin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I dont want to be like this<br/>
I dont really want to hurt no feelins<br/>
But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap<br/>
Old men have heart attacks<br/>
and I dont want to be responsible for that so<br/>
Put the mic down and walk away<br/>
You can still have a little bit of dignity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 1]</i><br/>
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino<br/>
an 83 year old fake Pachino<br/>
So how can he hold me over some balcony<br/>
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me<br/>
Please dont, youl probably fall with me<br/>
and our asses will both be history<br/>
But then again youl'll finally get your wish<br/>
cuz youl be all over the street like 50 Cent<br/>
Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump<br/>
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up<br/>
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up<br/>
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck<br/>
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin<br/>
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin<br/>
and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearences<br/>
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists<br/>
dont even respect you or take you serious<br/>
Its not that we dont like you, we hate you - period<br/>
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn<br/>
last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand<br/>
Now hes a busta? What the fucks with that?<br/>
Get on a track dissin us kissin 50's ass<br/>
and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me<br/>
bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me!<br/>
What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man<br/>
ready to take whatever sentence he hands<br/>
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists<br/>
right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl?<br/>
And I put that on her, when this is all over<br/>
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her<br/>
I dont know shit about no shoppin rocks<br/>
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots?<br/>
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin<br/>
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin<br/>
them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos<br/>
Just makin copys of your covers of cassette singles<br/>
and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer<br/>
Spendin your whole paycheck at Disc Makers<br/>
What you know about bein bullied over half your life?<br/>
Oh thats right, you know what thats like, your half white<br/>
Vanilla Ice,spill the beans and rice, I'm eating you alive inside<br/>
Jesus Christ, if your that much of a gangster, put the mic down<br/>
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now<br/>
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill'em dead bitch<br/>
Shoot'em in the fuckin head, go ahead bitch<br/>
Slap my mom, slap the f*ck outa her!<br/>
She cant sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you<br/>
Cuz your broke as fuck you suck your a fuckin joke<br/>
If you was really sellin coke, well then what the fuck<br/>
you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack<br/>
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap<br/>
You never had no security, you'll never be famous<br/>
You'l never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it?<br/>
Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens<br/>
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this<br/>
and Canibus they usin too many complicated fuckin words for you<br/>
Here then let me slow it down for you<br/>
so you can understand if I say it slower:<br/>
Let it go dawg it's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem talkin]</i><br/>
Haha<br/>
Talkin bout I have motherfuckers callin your crib<br/>
bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib<br/>
You aint even got a fuckin phone, fuckin Bum<br/>
Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin Source magazine<br/>
if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first<br/>
take it like a man and shut the fuck up<br/>
and fuck your little magazine too<br/>
I dont need your fuckin magazine, I got XXL number anywayz<br/>
And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin bigger than yall<br/>
oh, and by the way, howed I look on the VMAs?<br/>
When you was watchin me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin me from in Boston<br/>
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin sissy<br/>
Like you got us scared in the motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin dicks<br/>
Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo, the Source has a white owner
