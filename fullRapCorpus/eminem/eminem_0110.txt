<i>[Dido:]</i><br/>
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all<br/>
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all<br/>
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall<br/>
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad<br/>

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling<br/>
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom<br/>
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em<br/>
There probably was a problem at the post office or something<br/>
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em<br/>
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?<br/>
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father<br/>
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?<br/>
I'mma name her Bonnie<br/>
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry<br/>
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him<br/>
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan<br/>
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam<br/>
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man<br/>
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat<br/>
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back,<br/>
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<br/>
This is Stan<br/>
<br/>

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<br/>
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans<br/>
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert<br/>
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<br/>
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old<br/>
We waited in the blistering cold for you,<br/>
For four hours and you just said, "No."<br/>
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol<br/>
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br/>
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to<br/>
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you<br/>
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way<br/>
I never knew my father neither;<br/>
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her<br/>
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs<br/>
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on<br/>
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed<br/>
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest<br/>
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds<br/>
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me<br/>
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it<br/>
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7<br/>
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does<br/>
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up<br/>
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<br/>
Sincerely yours, Stan<br/>
P.S.<br/>
We should be together, too<br/>

Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,<br/>
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass<br/>
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?<br/>
I know you got my last two letters;<br/>
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect<br/>
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br/>
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway<br/>
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?<br/>
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air Tonight"<br/>
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning<br/>
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?<br/>
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning<br/>
Now it's too late. I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy<br/>
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br/>
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall<br/>
I love you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it<br/>
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br/>
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it<br/>
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me<br/>
See, Slim,â€”shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!<br/>
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,<br/>
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you<br/>
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too<br/>
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now<br/>
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?<br/>
<i>[*car tires squeal, crash, loud splash*]</i><br/>

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all<br/>

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy<br/>
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?<br/>
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that<br/>
And here's an autograph for your brother,<br/>
I wrote it on the Starter cap<br/>
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you<br/>
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br/>
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?<br/>
I say that shit just clowning dogg,<br/>
C'mon! How fucked up is you?<br/>
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling<br/>
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some<br/>
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br/>
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other<br/>
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br/>
Or maybe you just need to treat her better<br/>
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br/>
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine<br/>
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan<br/>
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan<br/>
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br/>
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br/>
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<br/>
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid<br/>
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br/>
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you<br/>
Damn!
