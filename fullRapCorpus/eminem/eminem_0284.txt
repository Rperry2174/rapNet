<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
No matter what people say<br/>
I'm gonna keep rapping this way<br/>
No matter what you may think<br/>
I'm gonna keep doing my thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I'm almost as famous as fat bald men<br/>
Decided to write songs to teach Musketeers to sing<br/>
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors<br/>
So she gets fifty years of bad luck <i>[crash]</i><br/>
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera<br/>
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara<br/>
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist<br/>
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants<br/>
Gotta have it, I hold Tylenol in his hands<br/>
'til it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands<br/>
(So who is it?)<br/>
The fool who visit the playground<br/>
With two biscuits to lay down the school district<br/>
Get pistol whipped with a Mauseburg<br/>
With a pistol grip and fed pitbulls shit<br/>
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits<br/>
If I get too rich, I just get sued<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
Yo, I leave with no injure, after I blow four in you<br/>
One handstand on top of your ninja<br/>
Crash it, (ERRRR) Doc stir the madness<br/>
'til you all outta work like Tony Atlas<br/>
Walking, cans in the laundry basket<br/>
America's most with the army after us<br/>
Fuck flossing, we take what's yours<br/>
A low fifteen like a ace in four<br/>
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off<br/>
(shit, the power's out)<br/>
The tape is off<br/>
Yo, you targeted from arsonists<br/>
Papermate pens filled with arsenic<br/>
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is<br/>
Doc could shape up, touch your barber miss<br/>
Betty you with a bloody blade<br/>
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake<br/>
Fuck bitches face is what I'm gonna do<br/>
'Cause that what white boy Tano do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
So how is everybody doing tonight?<br/>
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight<br/>
'Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it<br/>
So suck my dick if you all don't wanna bump to this... Off the Wall!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
Yo, so how is everybody feeling tonight?<br/>
Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight<br/>
'Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it<br/>
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump... Off the Wall!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
No matter what people say<br/>
I'm gonna keep rapping this way<br/>
No matter what you may think<br/>
I'm gonna keep doing my thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
Yo, you could buy Jaz spittin', hospital, son admit it<br/>
Rip your lips off, kiss my ass with it<br/>
Slap bitches, got Marshall Maths <i>[printing]</i><br/>
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it<br/>
I'm "What's happening?" with no "Rerun"<br/>
Doc Rob "Deniro" when the "Heat" come<br/>
My barrel hang out the Camaro<br/>
Aimed at the nose of them hoes it's hard to breathe from<br/>
Flash the gat, your town, bogardin'<br/>
Your wallet, your chain the main target<br/>
Beef is like cold engine, don't start it<br/>
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot<br/>
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you<br/>
From ten speed and brown shoe<br/>
Doc and Eminem, cock the M &amp; M<br/>
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker<br/>
Got the drugs stopped inside the lunch box <i>[uh]</i><br/>
Pop junk like I just got jumped<br/>
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump<br/>
Knock wood, it's all good, thank God for Vodka<br/>
'Cause with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker<br/>
Probably got a fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic<br/>
With an automatic calling me up there<br/>
My man Stan with a gat in his hand<br/>
Staking my house out in a tan tinted Sedan<br/>
He pull your mouth out 'til you can't finish a damn<br/>
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam<br/>
'til you gotta sip through a straw, shoplifted a mall<br/>
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall<br/>
Hey ma, maybe I'll give you a call<br/>
Sike you fucking bitch, suck a dick and two balls<br/>
I'm giving you all my job descript'<br/>
which is to piss bitches and priest off with this<br/>
Pop more pills than police officers<br/>
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim<br/>
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls<br/>
But you all can kiss my ass, pants off and all<br/>
'Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall<br/>
I might as well as be a painting smashed on the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
So how is everybody feeling tonight?<br/>
Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight<br/>
Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it<br/>
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump to this... Off the Wall!<br/>
