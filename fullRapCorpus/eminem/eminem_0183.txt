Yeah, yeah, I get it<br/>
I run this rap shit, now guess who’s back<br/>
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)<br/>
<br/>
They keep on sayin’ the same rappers are the best<br/>
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they’re just tryna distract it<br/>
From the fact that I’m comin’ back<br/>
Or maybe it’s cause I ain’t black, maybe it’s because of that<br/>
Maybe it’s because I’m the highest sellin’ artist in rap<br/>
While I’m sittin’ back in my office jackin’ off to my plaques<br/>
I’m still sick, how can I be sick this long<br/>
And I’m still alive, Magic Johnson arise<br/>
I thrive on makin’ my opponents think that I’ve died<br/>
That’s when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there<br/>
Damn I forgot how much money he got<br/>
On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man don’t lay<br/>
In the sun cause I don’t tan, I burn, blood clot<br/>
When you gonna learn how much money we’ve earned<br/>
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25<br/>
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20′s still<br/>
And Fif’ here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit<br/>
And he ain’t even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick<br/>
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score<br/>
To go from sellin’ bags to bottles right out the store<br/>
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us<br/>
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers<br/>
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay<br/>
I’m just a super easy modest MC, okay?<br/>
Til I hear the word has been, that’s when I start spazzin’<br/>
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then<br/>
I’m the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards<br/>
I’m a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye’s glasses!
