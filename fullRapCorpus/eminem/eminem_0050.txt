<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
Mentally ill from Amityville (HE'LL)<br/>
Accidentally kill your family still<br/>
Thinkin he won't? God-damnit he will (HE'SSSS)<br/>
Mentally ill from Amityville<br/>
<i>[(HE'SSSS) - on repeats only]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted<br/>
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick (SMACK)<br/>
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit<br/>
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit<br/>
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers (whoosh)<br/>
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches (smack)<br/>
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years<br/>
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bizarre]</i><br/>
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat<br/>
(AH!) Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope?<br/>
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me<br/>
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity<br/>
(Mmm mm mmm!) And bitches know me as a horny ass freak<br/>
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep<br/>
Pissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal (YOU FUCKING HOMO!)<br/>
That's what I said at my dad's funeral<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still (still)<br/>
That's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed (killed)<br/>
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville ('Ville)<br/>
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled (filled)<br/>
Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still (still)<br/>
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfucking Hamburger Hill! (Hill!)<br/>
We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot<br/>
and when the police come we fucking shoot it out with them too!<br/>
That's the mentality here (here) that's the reality here (here)<br/>
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here?? (huh?)<br/>
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibres here?? (here??)<br/>
Got some registration and just made this shit valid this year? (year?)<br/>
Cause once i snap i cant be held accountable for my actions<br/>
and that's when accidents happen,<br/>
when a thousand bullets come at your house<br/>
and collapse the foundation around and they found you<br/>
and your family in it (AH!)<br/>
GOT DAMNIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da<br/>
Dum..
