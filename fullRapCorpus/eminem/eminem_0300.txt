<i>[Eminem talkin']</i><br/>
Its all bad now man, its all bad<br/>
But yal done fucked up now<br/>
Yeah ha ha, new shit, hey yo<br/>
I just want the whole world to know:<br/>
That I did not start this, but I will finish it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Comin up it never mattered what color you was<br/>
If you could spit then you could spit, thats it, thats what it was<br/>
Back when, motherf*ckers was straight back packin<br/>
Cypherin, fightin for life in this rap<br/>
for the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped<br/>
and you hyped cuz you last and you might whoop some ass<br/>
If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man<br/>
and you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column<br/>
at The Source was like, the only source of light<br/>
When the mics used to mean somethin, a four was like<br/>
you were the shit, now its like the least you get<br/>
three and a half now just means you a piece of shit<br/>
four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas,<br/>
or Benzino I dont think you even realize<br/>
you playin with motherf*ckers lives, I done watched Dre<br/>
get ****ed on The Chronic, probably cuz I was on it<br/>
Now you fucked me outa my mics twice I let it slide<br/>
I said I wouldnt hold my f*cken breath to get a five<br/>
Sh*t I was right, Ida f*ckin died already tryin<br/>
I swear to God I never lie I bet thats why<br/>
you let that b*tch give me that bullsh*t review<br/>
I sat and took it, I aint look at the sh*t we knew<br/>
You'd probly try to f*ck us with Obie and 50 too<br/>
F*ck a relationship we through<br/>
No more Source with street cred, them days is dead<br/>
Dre's got A-Ks to Dave May's head<br/>
Every issue there's an eight page Made-Mens spread<br/>
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head<br/>
That I am not afraid, hes just a f*ckin waste of lead<br/>
on my pencil, for me to write some sh*t this simple<br/>
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed<br/>
This old Gs bout to get smoked like rolled weed<br/>
You dont know me or my motherf*ckin mother you motherf*ckin punk<br/>
Put me on your fuckin cover just to sell your little sell out mag<br/>
I aint mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad<br/>
You wanna talk about some sh*t that you dont know about? ya<br/>
Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there<br/>
To try to eat off him, cuz you missed your boat<br/>
Your never gonna blow b*tch your just too old<br/>
No wonder your sore now lordy your bored now<br/>
Im pushin thirty your kickin fourty's door down<br/>
B*tch this is war now, and youl never beat me<br/>
all you do is cheat me out of QUATABLES but you know<br/>
that youl always see me on your TV<br/>
Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin<br/>
To see your video played once on bet<br/>
So he-he-he who has the last laugh?<br/>
Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff<br/>
kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back<br/>
Just know that Benzinos wack<br/>
no matter how many times I say his name, hell never blow jack<br/>
Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back<br/>
Look at your track record thats how far it goes back<br/>
Its extortion n Ray own's a proportion<br/>
so half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston<br/>
Bullyin and bossin, Dave like a slave they've completely brainwashed him<br/>
And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest<br/>
fakest, wannabe gangster in New York<br/>
And its pitiful, cuz I would have never said sh*t to you if you'd have kept your mouth shut<br/>
B*tch now what? Hit it Clue, spit it Slay<br/>
New sh*t, exclusive, yo Lantern, Whoo Kid<br/>
You know what to do with this: use it<br/>
Im through, this is stupid, I cant believe I stooped to this<br/>
bullsh*t to do this...<br/>
<br/>
And who you callin a b*tch? B*tch. You owe me.
