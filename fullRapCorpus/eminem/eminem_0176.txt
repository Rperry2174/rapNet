Can't stop now, this may be the last chance that I getâ€”<br/>
(I just wanna be famous).<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You dream of trading places,<br/>
I have been changing faces<br/>
You can not fill these shoes,<br/>
There is too much to lose.<br/>
Wake up behind these trenches,<br/>
You run around defenseless.<br/>
There is too much to lose,<br/>
You can not fill these shoes<br/>
I just want to be famous,<br/>
But be careful what you wish for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist<br/>
They call me Slim Roethlisberger<br/>
I go berserker than a fed-up post-office worker<br/>
A murker with a Mossberg<br/>
I'm pissed off, get murdered<br/>
Like someone took a ketchup squirter<br/>
Squirted a frankfurter<br/>
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants<br/>
When you saw that chainsaw get to waving<br/>
Like a terrible towel<br/>
How thangs turn out<br/>
When his fangs come out<br/>
Get your brains blown out<br/>
That's what I call blowing your mind<br/>
When I cum back<br/>
Like nut on your spine<br/>
I'm the thumb tack<br/>
That you slept on son<br/>
Now here I come screaming "a tac!" like I just stepped on one<br/>
Low on the totem till he showed 'em<br/>
Defiance, giant scrotum<br/>
He don't owe 'dem bitches shit<br/>
His britches, he out growed 'em<br/>
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole<br/>
And nobody fucks with him<br/>
Rigor mortis and post mortem<br/>
He's dying of boredom<br/>
Take your best rhymes, record 'em<br/>
To try to thwart him<br/>
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em<br/>
Shit stained drawers<br/>
You gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws<br/>
While he dips 'em in PF Chang's sauce<br/>
Games off, homie, hang it up like some crank calls<br/>
You think I'm backing down<br/>
You must be out of your dang skulls<br/>
I'm almost famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm back for revenge<br/>
I lost a battle that ain't happening again<br/>
I'm at your throat like strep<br/>
I step, strapped with a pen<br/>
Metaphors wrote on my hand,<br/>
Some are just stored in my memory<br/>
Some are wrote on a napkin<br/>
I do what I have to to win<br/>
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's<br/>
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers<br/>
And tell that psycho to pass the torch<br/>
To the whacko 'fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern<br/>
And smash it on his porch<br/>
Now get off my dick<br/>
Dick's too short of a word for my dick<br/>
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick<br/>
Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer<br/>
I just blew up the Challenger, matta' fact I need a lawyer<br/>
I just laced my gloves wit' enough plaster<br/>
To make a cast, beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Vern Troyer<br/>
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, your meni me's<br/>
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class<br/>
He slugs, you're BB's you're bean bag bullets<br/>
You're full of it; you were dissin' his CD's<br/>
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties<br/>
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast<br/>
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E.<br/>
He's almost famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls<br/>
Screaming the wood off the panelling<br/>
Cussing the paint off the walls<br/>
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads<br/>
He ain't given 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard<br/>
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark<br/>
When it scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "awww!"<br/>
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all<br/>
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off<br/>
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by<br/>
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die<br/>
And eat shit while they at it<br/>
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world<br/>
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl<br/>
The bullies become bullied, if pussies get pushed<br/>
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me<br/>
'Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blow it<br/>
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it<br/>
And while I'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar<br/>
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered<br/>
So bare witness to some biblical shit<br/>
There's a cold wind blowing<br/>
This world ain't gonna know what hit it<br/>
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous
