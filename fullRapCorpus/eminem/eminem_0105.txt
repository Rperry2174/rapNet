Once you call my name out things will never be the same....<br/>
They should have never let us get off foot in this game...<br/>
Ever since I was introduced to rap music<br/>
I been missing a screw like Bishop and Juice<br/>
I could lose it at any moment<br/>
Those who know me know it<br/>
So they're probably told you go with the flow<br/>
Just so that I don't explode<br/>
And have another episode where I let it go as far as<br/>
The one with Benzino did I'm waiting for that next beef,<br/>
I'm cocked, locked and loaded<br/>
I'm ready to go so bad I'm going bananas,<br/>
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with<br/>
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated<br/>
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it<br/>
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game<br/>
Cause they know that they don't spit the same<br/>
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame<br/>
Everyday it's the same thing,<br/>
People in this game try to buddy buddy us<br/>
Just to get close enough to study us<br/>
Everybody just wants to have something to do with that<br/>
They all trying to get that stamp<br/>
They after that Shady - Aftermath money<br/>
It's like a monopoly<br/>
They probably just now finally understand how to rob fully<br/>
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me<br/>
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery<br/>
And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other<br/>
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers<br/>
When we rhyme with each other<br/>
In time we discovered that we have more in common<br/>
Then we thought with each other<br/>
Both robbed of our mothers<br/>
Our fathers ain't want us<br/>
What was wrong with us, was it our fault<br/>
Cause we started thinking god doesn't love us<br/>
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time<br/>
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens<br/>
I still remember the call up in ??<br/>
Big L had just got popped just a month before<br/>
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia<br/>
Two years later me and Doc had to come and, uh, operate<br/>
That's when he popped up a number one<br/>
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-ering<br/>
Even if I'm under the gun<br/>
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me<br/>
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I<br/>
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit<br/>
Still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual<br/>
Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all<br/>
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's<br/>
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them<br/>
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats<br/>
Stomping, I been romping since Tim Dogg was hollering<br/>
'Fuck Compton'<br/>
I was whilin', free styling back when they was still making Maxell cassettes<br/>
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet<br/>
That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit<br/>
Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc<br/>
Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc<br/>
And you don't stop
