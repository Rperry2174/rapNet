(You don't own me. Don't try to change me)<br/>
Nah man<br/>
Not quite finished yet<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I think,<br/>
You just might've tried to pull a motherfucking fast one, I'm mad<br/>
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one I had<br/>
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?<br/>
See this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker<br/>
in your walk-way? Better co-operate<br/>
Or get saut√©ed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied<br/>
MC's get so quiet you can hear a motherfucking dog whistle when I walk by<br/>
'Colt Seavers' on a mule, stunting on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy<br/>
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai<br/>
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women and men<br/>
Vrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine<br/>
Bitch, give me them digits, why you're cringin'<br/>
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin<br/>
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when<br/>
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?<br/>
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty<br/>
just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me<br/>
Eenie meenie miney mo, Catch an Eskimo by his toe (you don't own me)<br/>
While he's trying to roll a snowball,<br/>
but don't make him lose his cool<br/>
If he hollers better let him go ya'll, 'cause (you don't own me)<br/>
<br/>
Now here we go go go<br/>
<br/>
Get up! Baby, get a move on, like a U-Haul<br/>
You can rack your brain like pool balls<br/>
You won't ever think of this shit<br/>
Yeah, honey you called?<br/>
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it<br/>
Evil I see, hear and speak it<br/>
Lady, put your money on Shady<br/>
Fuck that other weak shit<br/>
Put your eggs in the same basket<br/>
You can count every motherfucking chicken 'fore it hatches<br/>
'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'<br/>
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'<br/>
Get your brains bashed in so bad<br/>
You gon' have Kurt Cobain askin'<br/>
To autograph a bloodstained napkin<br/>
Unfashionable and 'bout as rational<br/>
as a rational fag's asshole<br/>
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton<br/>
See if he's cool with it<br/>
Don't stand there and look stupid at me, bitch<br/>
I ain't in the mood for this shit<br/>
Get my dick, Google it 'til it pops up<br/>
Ya'll are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up<br/>
Me, I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth<br/>
'Til your speakers crap out <i>[fart]</i> "Ohp, What?"<br/>
Girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette "Chik-Chigarette"<br/>
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me<br/>
So do not strut my way, slut! Because..<br/>
<br/>
You don't own me<br/>
<br/>
Here we go go go<br/>
<br/>
And now that I got your panties in a bunch<br/>
and your bowels in an uproar<br/>
Im'ma show you why I came<br/>
So you stop asking me what the fuck for<br/>
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore I know you want more,<br/>
bitch, it's time to put the 'Math' back in the Mathers<br/>
'Cause I'm a fucking problem, run boy!<br/>
Every flow got it mastered<br/>
So every last word that you fucking fags heard<br/>
comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah<br/>
In other words I'm a bass-turd!<br/>
Looking at me like I killed Kenny<br/>
Gas in the tank, yeah still plenty<br/>
No morals are instilled in me<br/>
So remorse I really don't feel any<br/>
Eat your heart out, Hannibal<br/>
Understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal<br/>
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya hoe?<br/>
Shady, I don't understand your flow.<br/>
Understand my flow?<br/>
Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy.<br/>
Don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy.<br/>
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare<br/>
stay the fuck outta my hair, boy!<br/>
You can look, you can stare and point<br/>
But you can't touch -- I'm too clairvoyant.<br/>
I don't get it man, is there a void<br/>
All this weak shit, what am I steroids?<br/>
Well, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass<br/>
and your trunk, Elephant hemorrhoids<br/>
<br/>
And remember boys<br/>
<br/>
You don't own me<br/>
<br/>
Now here we go go go<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for coming out<br/>
Hope you enjoyed the show<br/>
'Til next time<br/>
<br/>
ha ha<br/>
<br/>
Peace!
