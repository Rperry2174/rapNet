<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Yeah girl<br/>
Can you hear that?<br/>
It's playing our song<br/>
Are you sleepy?<br/>
Take a nap<br/>
You're not afraid of the dark are ya?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
You hear the beat As it makes ya Not want to go to sleep<br/>
I knock on Dakota's door It's locked so I go to creep<br/>
'round the back with binoculars Not 'cause I want to peep<br/>
But because I'm hungry She smells like taco's I want to eat<br/>
Visions of hot choclatey marshmallows Also sweet<br/>
With sugar plums Oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street<br/>
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet<br/>
Now walk on 'em He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek<br/>
Like a Thanksgiving turkey A holiday ham<br/>
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast With strawberry marmalade jam<br/>
Flavor my favorite graham crackers With Jon Benet Rams<br/>
I guess a modern day jack the ripper Is all that I am<br/>
My music box<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep<br/>
But i can hear u my love, you keep calling me<br/>
I want the world to know, you mean the world to me<br/>
So when you call me to come, I will answer<br/>
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep<br/>
I hear my music box, playing a song for me<br/>
So wont you whirl around, and do a whirl for me<br/>
And want you be my private dancer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I almost look comatose, Who wants to be sobered gross<br/>
I foam like a doberman, mouth open I overdose<br/>
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose<br/>
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know<br/>
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around<br/>
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds<br/>
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out<br/>
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out<br/>
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?<br/>
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house<br/>
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box<br/>
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked<br/>
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts<br/>
I dig til I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts<br/>
It's playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark<br/>
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I'm fixated on asphyxating and breakin' this little chick's<br/>
Neck like a pixie stick<br/>
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippins,<br/>
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in<br/>
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'<br/>
The mortition of love, sent from above,<br/>
Forced entry, the more wenchy, the more stingy I become<br/>
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb<br/>
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns<br/>
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder<br/>
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her<br/>
And climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her<br/>
with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her<br/>
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her<br/>
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha!<br/>
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya<br/>
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula<br/>
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her<br/>
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her<br/>
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera<br/>
Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
