<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
You know I just don't get it<br/>
Last year I was nobody<br/>
This year I'm sellin records<br/>
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin<br/>
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?<br/>
Get the fuck out of here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)<br/>
I'm just a regular guy,<br/>
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)<br/>
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,<br/>
all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)<br/>
Now everybody wanna run they mouth<br/>
and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Yo, you might see me joggin, you might see me walkin<br/>
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog<br/>
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar<br/>
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin<br/>
(grrrr, ARF ARF) Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun<br/>
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in<br/>
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous<br/>
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is<br/>
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace<br/>
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this<br/>
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em<br/>
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets<br/>
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches<br/>
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous<br/>
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin<br/>
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman ("God damnit!")<br/>
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin<br/>
with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started<br/>
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage<br/>
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars<br/>
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling<br/>
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?<br/>
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned<br/>
passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?<br/>
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick<br/>
Boy/girl groups make me sick<br/>
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public<br/>
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)<br/>
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)<br/>
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)<br/>
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)<br/>
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me<br/>
and run around screamin, "I don't care, just bite me" (nah nah)<br/>
I think I was put here to annoy the world<br/>
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl<br/>
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer<br/>
and call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer<br/>
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay<br/>
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)<br/>
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out<br/>
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out<br/>
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out<br/>
(AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!<br/>
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again<br/>
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10<br/>
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females<br/>
in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails<br/>
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus<br/>
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)<br/>
I'm not a wrestler guy,<br/>
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)<br/>
Come and see me on the streets alone<br/>
if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)<br/>
And if you wanna run your mouth<br/>
then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?<br/>
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy<br/>
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top<br/>
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?<br/>
The underground just spunned around and did a 360<br/>
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies<br/>
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,<br/>
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"<br/>
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million<br/>
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin<br/>
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?<br/>
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress<br/>
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?<br/>
It doesn't matter your <i>[attorney Fred Gibson's a]</i> faggot!<br/>
Talkin about I fabricated my past<br/>
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)<br/>
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?<br/>
For every million I make, another relative sues<br/>
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper<br/>
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)<br/>
A half-brother and sister who never seen me<br/>
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV<br/>
Now everybody's so happy and proud<br/>
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house<br/>
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand<br/>
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp<br/>
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast<br/>
and what do I see? A picture of my big white ass<br/>
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:<br/>
uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL<br/>
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell<br/>
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One (2X)]</i>
