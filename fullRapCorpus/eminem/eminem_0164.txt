<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ayo Before I start this song man<br/>
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient<br/>
And bearing with me over these last couple of years<br/>
While I figure this shit out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kobe]</i><br/>
Is anybody out there?<br/>
It feels like I'm talkin to myself<br/>
No one seems to know my struggle<br/>
And everything I come from<br/>
Can anybody hear me?<br/>
I guess I keep talkin to myself<br/>
It feels like I'm going insane<br/>
Am I the one who's crazy?<br/>
<br/>
Yeayah<br/>
Woah wah<br/>
Woah wah (oh oh oh oh oh)<br/>
Woah wah<br/>
Woah wah (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Eminem]</i><br/>
So why in the world do I feel so alone<br/>
Nobody but me, I'm on my own<br/>
Is there anyone out there<br/>
Who feels the way I feel<br/>
If there is, let me hear just so I know I'm not the only one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Eminem]</i><br/>
I went away I guess to open up some lanes<br/>
But there was no one who even knew that I was going through growin' pains<br/>
Hatred was flowing through my veins<br/>
On the verge of going insane<br/>
I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne<br/>
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'<br/>
I felt horrible about myself<br/>
He was spittin and I wasn't<br/>
Anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it<br/>
Almost went at Kanye too<br/>
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic<br/>
Thank God that I didn't do it<br/>
I would've had my ass handed to me<br/>
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it<br/>
I'm in the booth poppin another pill tryna talk myself into it<br/>
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin people for no reason?<br/>
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even<br/>
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying<br/>
Your health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kobe]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Eminem]</i><br/>
Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow<br/>
All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathing and hollow<br/>
Bottoms up on the pill bottle<br/>
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow<br/>
My sorrow echoes in this hall though<br/>
But I must be talkin to the wall though<br/>
I don't see nobody else (I guess I keep talkin to myself)<br/>
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know<br/>
I've turned into a hater, I've put up a false bravado<br/>
But Marshall is not a egomaniac that's not his motto<br/>
He's not a desperado he's desperate, it's starting to bottle inside 'em<br/>
One foot on the brake one on the throttle<br/>
Fallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of McDonald's<br/>
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it<br/>
Admit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough<br/>
It isn't them it's you you fuckin baby<br/>
Quit worrying about what they do and do shady<br/>
I'm fucking going crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kobe]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Eminem]</i><br/>
So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore I drowned<br/>
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice suffice this time around<br/>
It's different them last two albums didn't count<br/>
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing em out<br/>
I've come to make it up to you no more fucking around<br/>
I've got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I've let em down<br/>
So please accept my apology I finally feel like I'm back to normal<br/>
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know<br/>
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no<br/>
Signs of slowin up, pullin up, blowin up, all over<br/>
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos<br/>
I'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep ya head up,<br/>
T.I., keep ya head up, Kanye, keep ya head up,<br/>
Don't let up, keep slayin em<br/>
Rest in Peace to DJ AM<br/>
Cause I know what it's like<br/>
I struggle with this shit every single day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kobe]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Eminem]</i><br/>
So there it is (there it is)<br/>
Damn<br/>
It feels like I just woke up or something<br/>
I guess I just... forgot who the fuck I was man<br/>
Ay yo<br/>
And to anybody who thought about going there, it was never nothing personal, some shit I was going through<br/>
And to everybody else...<br/>
I'm back! (I'm back) haha
