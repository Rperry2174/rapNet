What is a nightmare? The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare<br/>
<br/>
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious<br/>
'Til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop<br/>
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons<br/>
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching<br/>
Missouri for Michigan didn't work<br/>
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan<br/>
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again<br/>
Mom please stick to a decision<br/>
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen she's like<br/>
Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Kryptonite<br/>
So the walls and I done lost my power to see through them bitches<br/>
But I run into them, running through the kitchen<br/>
Pretending to be blind Superman<br/>
'Cause I had no supervision<br/>
But I did have a super power though<br/>
I could turn into Invisible Kid<br/>
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician<br/>
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different<br/>
Music into the picture and it became my new religion<br/>
"I remember it clearly, even today."<br/>
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan<br/>
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping<br/>
Through the radio stations one day<br/>
And discovered this DJ who was mixing<br/>
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard<br/>
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing<br/>
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing<br/>
For shoes, fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops<br/>
You get the new LL Cool J cooling system<br/>
Made that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover and somehow I saw my future is in this<br/>
That's how I knew my mission<br/>
Little boom box boomin', spitting<br/>
Practicing numerous rhythms<br/>
When I sit in my room envisioning<br/>
My dreams come to fruition<br/>
I remember Proof would visit<br/>
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go cuckoo ballistic<br/>
Go through the roof for his shit<br/>
It's like we knew the instant<br/>
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit<br/>
Never quit, too persistent<br/>
"We are the underground empire."<br/>
<br/>
Started a group of misfits<br/>
Proof had a proposition<br/>
If we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit<br/>
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and<br/>
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position<br/>
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'<br/>
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you<br/>
And you forgot your written<br/>
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again<br/>
They tried ding-dong ditching shit<br/>
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock<br/>
Cut off his oxygen Slim snot gourgin<br/>
Cock sucking cynder block in the wind<br/>
Now I got my pot to piss in<br/>
Spot in that top position<br/>
Copping over the opposition<br/>
Looking like a dog that's pissing<br/>
Leg up on the competition<br/>
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson<br/>
I'm in a league Muhammad's in<br/>
Ali's my colleague bombing them<br/>
Probably end up on top of them<br/>
Stomping them like Ndamukong<br/>
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson<br/>
Flow vomits in your face<br/>
Competitors fall at my waist<br/>
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face<br/>
So name the time, place to battle<br/>
Bitch I'm still in that mind state<br/>
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes<br/>
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose<br/>
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours<br/>
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse<br/>
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers<br/>
Now where's your poop birds?<br/>
Ooh, no more tripping in bird shit, songs of self-empowerment surging<br/>
Words of encouragement but this discouraging the rappers<br/>
The rap game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith<br/>
So let these words lift<br/>
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't working out<br/>
Each verse is more merciless than the first is<br/>
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served<br/>
Blood thirst, Revenge of the Nerds<br/>
Chickit<br/>
<br/>
"And it's true that you'll not escape my vengeance."<br/>
<br/>
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone<br/>
Word to Uncle Ron<br/>
I'm turning into a non-humble Don<br/>
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on<br/>
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on<br/>
Better back away from the front row, get launched<br/>
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo<br/>
On the fuckin' Jumbotron<br/>
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaat<br/>
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn<br/>
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass<br/>
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap<br/>
The GOAT just ate eight acres,<br/>
An eighth of that was just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper<br/>
Oh look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked<br/>
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot<br/>
Charred debris floating<br/>
Like oak wood was burning<br/>
Return of the no good<br/>
And I won't quit<br/>
<br/>
"And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below<br/>
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane."<br/>
<br/>
And I don't quit, won't change,<br/>
It's like a Groundhog's Day<br/>
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may<br/>
See if I popped your head<br/>
<br/>
"I'm a heartless monster"<br/>
Turn me into<br/>
"I'm a heartless monster"<br/>
"With my dick in your mouth all day"<br/>
<br/>
I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came<br/>
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed<br/>
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing
