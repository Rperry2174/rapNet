<i>[Eminem - Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I want you to understand something<br/>
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping<br/>
I want them fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire<br/>
But I feel like a million bucks, Ladies won't you fill your cups?<br/>
Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup<br/>
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E<br/>
You'll be in the E-R, we are strapped with so much T-N-T<br/>
We may blow, no, not even C-P-R from the EMT<br/>
Can help you to resuscitate, You bustas must be flustered, wait<br/>
You can't cut the mustard, What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?<br/>
(chk chk) What's my name? Shady came to crush the game<br/>
Instantly, not even fair to them cause they pale in comparisons<br/>
So much they might as well wear a skin, don't you wish you could just share his pen?<br/>
Cause this shit is getting embarrassing, the fog is thick and the air is thin<br/>
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe, Dadidadidadadi<br/>
He makes it look so easy, Girl you just hit the lottery<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now this would be the part of the song<br/>
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose<br/>
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us<br/>
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do<br/>
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking<br/>
For any excuse to just cut loose<br/>
<br/>
So this would be the part of the song<br/>
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre (Eminem) - Verse 2:]</i><br/>
This is when shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand<br/>
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers<br/>
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front<br/>
So do what we say and once it's over like a suance, it hums<br/>
(It makes them stay in a trance, No choice, they have to dance)<br/>
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt<br/>
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts<br/>
You must be smokin' something, think I ain't smokin' nothing, stay off my nuts<br/>
<br/>
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust<br/>
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose<br/>
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse<br/>
D-R-E is on the loose, I'm like a goose when it comes to the Chronic use<br/>
You know I can't stand to lose, Me and my goons are like animals<br/>
Wake up like a pack of wolves and we came here to extract the roof<br/>
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your mans is like in the booth<br/>
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Now this would be the part of the song<br/>
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose<br/>
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us<br/>
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do<br/>
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking<br/>
For any excuse to just cut loose<br/>
<br/>
So this would be the part of the song<br/>
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Now I know you're feelin discouraged but homie just mark my words<br/>
I'm mur-durin the flow, liquid courage I'm fin' to blow<br/>
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe<br/>
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go<br/>
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows<br/>
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' hoe<br/>
With speakers knockin it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop<br/>
"E" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow<br/>
We ain't bluffin for nothin, we'll knock the stuffin out you<br/>
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet<br/>
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably<br/>
Pass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me<br/>
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets<br/>
Them haters hatin on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep<br/>
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, Dre fall off that's news to me
