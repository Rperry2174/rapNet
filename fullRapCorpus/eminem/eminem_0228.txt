<i>[Lickety Split]</i><br/>
<br/>
This guy's a choke artist<br/>
Ya catch a bad one<br/>
Your better off shootin yourself<br/>
With Papa Doc's handgun<br/>
Climbin up this mountain your weak<br/>
Ill leave you lost without a paddle<br/>
Floatin shits creek<br/>
<br/>
You ain't Detroit, Im the D<br/>
Your the new kid on the block<br/>
Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks<br/>
Fuckin Nazi, this crowd ain't your type<br/>
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice<br/>
And what I tell you, you better use it<br/>
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music<br/>
<br/>
Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath<br/>
And have you lookin foolish <br/>
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself<br/>
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that<br/>
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his asscrack<br/>
And when you actin up thats when you got jacked up<br/>
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up<br/>
<br/>
Ill crack your shoulder blade<br/>
Youll get dropped so hard <br/>
Elvis will start turnin in his grave<br/>
I dont know why they let you out in the dark<br/>
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile<br/>
To the trailor park<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rabbit]</i><br/>
<br/>
This guy raps like his parents jerked him<br/>
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version<br/>
This whole crowd looks suspicious<br/>
Its all dudes in here, except for these bitches<br/>
So Im a German, Eh<br/>
Thats ok, you look like a fuckin worm with braids<br/>
These Leaders of the Free World rookies<br/>
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies<br/>
<br/>
Talkin bout shits creek<br/>
Bitch, you could be up piss creek <br/>
With paddles this deep<br/>
Your still gonna sink<br/>
Your a disgrace<br/>
Yeah, they call me Rabbit<br/>
This is a turtle race<br/>
<br/>
He can't get with me spittin this shit<br/>
Wickedly lickety shot<br/>
Spickety spickety split lickety<br/>
So Im gonna turn around with a great smile<br/>
And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!
