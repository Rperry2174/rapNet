<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone<br/>
This bed's empty without you<br/>
You said you're moving on<br/>
But I'm having some trouble getting there<br/>
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere<br/>
Fuckin' Valentine's Day<br/>
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere<br/>
Machete on the floor I smashed up every mirror<br/>
Yeah, how do I look?<br/>
You fuckin' just let me here to, die didn't you?<br/>
Why didn't you respond yet?<br/>
I've written you five or six different times and<br/>
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apolo-gizing to you<br/>
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through<br/>
This couldn't be true, we can't be over<br/>
So violets are blue, roses are red<br/>
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kobe:]</i><br/>
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night<br/>
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light<br/>
Saw my old sweetheart she said, "honey, I'm back"<br/>
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back<br/>
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you<br/>
So I'm findin' something the matter with them<br/>
Excuse to not see anyone<br/>
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol<br/>
I get bowled like bowling balls<br/>
No balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say<br/>
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman<br/>
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak<br/>
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains<br/>
Like birthday cake candles<br/>
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake<br/>
Can't escape the madness<br/>
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song<br/>
But I can't even change the station<br/>
The same one's playin' on eight channels<br/>
I lay awake in shambles I'm startin to hallucinate<br/>
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes<br/>
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kobe:]</i><br/>
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night<br/>
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light<br/>
Saw my old sweetheart she said, "honey, I'm back"<br/>
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone<br/>
<br/>
Give me one more, bottle for the pain<br/>
Give me one more for the memories<br/>
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak<br/>
It'll help alleviate<br/>
It'll soothe this ache<br/>
Of trying to fake<br/>
That she's really, she's really coming back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how<br/>
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love<br/>
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it<br/>
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent<br/>
And how I'll never hold you again<br/>
Ain't shit I can do about it<br/>
Now my head is overcrowded<br/>
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it<br/>
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably<br/>
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?<br/>
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?<br/>
Completely, deep and madly, head over heels for you<br/>
Was you and me, once used to be together forever<br/>
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream<br/>
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much<br/>
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kobe:]</i><br/>
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night<br/>
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light<br/>
Saw my old sweetheart she said, "honey, I'm back"<br/>
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
