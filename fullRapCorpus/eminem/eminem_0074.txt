<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Tuning TV]</i><br/>
<i>[Eminem Snortin Crack]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[TV Presenter:]</i><br/>
Hello boys and girls<br/>
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships<br/>
Do you have a daddy?<br/>
I'll bet you do<br/>
<i>[Door opens]</i><br/>
who's your daddy?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
Daddy, what're you doing?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beat starts]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Haha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem &amp; Hailie:]</i><br/>
Ok then! everybody, listen up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
Somebody, please help him!<br/>
<i>[giggle]</i><br/>
i think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse #1:]</i><br/>
There's no mountain i can't climb<br/>
There's no tower too high,<br/>
No plane that i can't learn how to fly<br/>
What do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you<br/>
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to<br/>
<i>[Hailie Makes Chainsaw Sound]</i><br/>
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls<br/>
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar<br/>
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed,<br/>
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall<br/>
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off<br/>
All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr Dre:]</i><br/>
Suck it marshall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
So tell Laura and her husband to back off<br/>
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off<br/>
And launch one of these russians, and that's all<br/>
<i>[Hailie Makes Explosion Sound]</i><br/>
Blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off<br/>
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?<br/>
<i>[Knocking]</i><br/>
Hailie, tell 'em baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
My dad's lost it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
A little help from Hailie Jade won't you tell em' baby<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Theres nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's like my mother always told me<br/>
<i>[Eminem Impersinates His Mom]</i><br/>
Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana,<br/>
and codeine and goddamit, you little motherfucker<br/>
If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'<br/>
uh..<br/>
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick<br/>
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second<br/>
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record<br/>
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy<br/>
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose<br/>
Then quit bringin my flows, quit giving me my ammo<br/>
Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my<br/>
m.o.<br/>
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo<br/>
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more<br/>
Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
Dad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse #3:]</i><br/>
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise<br/>
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme<br/>
See what you're seeing is a genius at work<br/>
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,<br/>
Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek<br/>
I'd yank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue<br/>
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once<br/>
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son<br/>
And walk around the rest of my life spit on<br/>
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung<br/>
Like R Kelly as soon as "bump n' grind" comes on<br/>
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a<br/>
plane<br/>
Aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,<br/>
Screaming at the sky, till clouds gather as Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade<br/>
And thats pretty much the gist of it,Parents are pissed, but the kids love<br/>
it<br/>
Nine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers<br/>
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
ha ha<br/>
You're funny daddy!
