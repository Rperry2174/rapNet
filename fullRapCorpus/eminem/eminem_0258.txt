Shady records ain't nobody better than this<br/>
Shady records no cheddar than us <br/>
Shady records ain't nobody better than this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You can hate me all you want <br/>
It don't phase me, its so crazy<br/>
I let these motherfuckers worry about what I'm doing<br/>
But they need to worry about them goddamn selves<br/>
I just do me <br/>
You should be doing you not trying to copy on me<br/>
I got this locked from the burbs to the projects<br/>
Now none of you worry cause I got next<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
This rap shit out I map shit strategically<br/>
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key<br/>
To my success it's worked for me repeatedly<br/>
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key<br/>
Let them diss you first respond immediately<br/>
In order to master art of war don't start a war shit not no more<br/>
We done scared them off there are no more<br/>
Victims to sick I'm fixing the pics <br/>
I'm a start shit ain't got no pictures to rip<br/>
And shit to throw darts at <br/>
Ain't got no more targets shit Irv and Jeff   <br/>
We don't beat em to death benzino in dept<br/>
Just be no one left to bully <br/>
Bush is pussy, why the fuck you think in name's bush<br/>
Puss is bushy ain't shit going on shit I been getting so bored lately<br/>
I'm thinking of doing some shit<br/>
To get you to go and hate me again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
The game just isn't the same its changing<br/>
Shit Dre's quitting Jay's quitting<br/>
Now its wanksta they're saying the same shit<br/>
It's ancient its fake <br/>
Its making me so bored I'ma just make a new language<br/>
Fubba U cuppa cubba Uppa u Uppa Oobba<br/>
Youbba can Susubba my dadabbadick throug the tuba<br/>
Some other rumour lama I'm not a huma I'ma<br/>
Supersonic new robotic suicidal Unabomber<br/>
You think I'm the new osama<br/>
Press thinks I'm a new madonna<br/>
Jeffry Dahmer left me <br/>
With his legacy to carry on a<br/>
Lot talk and rumors on us <br/>
Who's the hottest to be honest <br/>
Hip hop ain't been the same since tupac moved to cuba on us<br/>
<br/>
Shady records ain't nobody better than this<br/>
Shady records no fucking more cheddar than us <br/>
Shady records ain't nobody better than this<br/>
Shady records no fucking more cheddar than us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You can hate all you want, but I don't give it a thought<br/>
Coz you don't know about me<br/>
Its really that simple, I can fit in a thimble whatcha<br/>
Know about me?<br/>
They ain't feeling my songs, I tell the haters be gone coz <br/>
You don't know about me...better het use to the fact<br/>
That I be doing this tracks until they know about me<br/>
<br/>
Shady records ain't nobody better than this<br/>
Shady records no cheddar than us <br/>
Shady records ain't nobody better than this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
