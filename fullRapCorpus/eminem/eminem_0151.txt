Ooww ladies and gentlemen<br/>
The moment you've all been waiting for..<br/>
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,<br/>
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,<br/>
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world:<br/>
Slim Shady!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus — Eminem:]</i><br/>
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle<br/>
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto<br/>
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe<br/>
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes<br/>
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?<br/>
I notice there's so many of 'em<br/>
And there's really not that many of us.<br/>
and ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.<br/>
It's on till the break of dawn<br/>
And we're starting this party from dusk<br/>
<br/>
OK... let's go<br/>
<br/>
Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk<br/>
Fix your musk, you'll just be another one bit the dust<br/>
Just one of my mothers son who got thrown under the bus<br/>
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts<br/>
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks<br/>
It's a must I redeem my name 'n' haters get mushed.<br/>
Bitches lust. Man, they love me when I lay in the cut.<br/>
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.<br/>
Now picture us. it's ridiculous you curse at the thought<br/>
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit<br/>
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce<br/>
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time<br/>
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes<br/>
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.<br/>
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true<br/>
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal<br/>
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus — Eminem:]</i><br/>
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle<br/>
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto<br/>
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe<br/>
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes<br/>
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?<br/>
I notice there's so many of 'em<br/>
And there's really not that many of us.<br/>
and ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.<br/>
It's on till the break of dawn<br/>
And we're starting this party from dusk<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
They see that low rider go by, they're, like, "Oh, my!"<br/>
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.<br/>
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.<br/>
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.<br/>
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.<br/>
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day<br/>
And this one begins where the last one ends.<br/>
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.<br/>
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.<br/>
Driving around with a smashed front end<br/>
Let's cash that one in.<br/>
Grab another one from out the stable<br/>
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado<br/>
The hell if I know.<br/>
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?<br/>
Decisions, decisions<br/>
Garage looks like Precision Collision.<br/>
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco<br/>
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though<br/>
<br/>
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle<br/>
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto<br/>
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe<br/>
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes<br/>
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?<br/>
I notice there's so many of 'em<br/>
And there's really not that many of us.<br/>
and ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.<br/>
It's on till the break of dawn<br/>
And we're starting this party from dusk<br/>
<br/>
And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent]</i><br/>
It's bottle after bottle<br/>
The money ain't a thing when you party with me<br/>
It's what we into, it's simple<br/>
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe<br/>
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, I'm King Kong<br/>
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on<br/>
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm<br/>
Bring the shaun dawn, burn marajaun, do what you want<br/>
Nigga, on and on till the break of what<br/>
Get the paper, man, I'm caking, you know, I don't give a fuck<br/>
I spend it like it don't mean nothing<br/>
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown<br/>
Motherfucker I'm grown<br/>
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit<br/>
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick<br/>
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit, Jimmy Choos shoes<br/>
I say move a bitch move<br/>
<br/>
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle<br/>
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto<br/>
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe<br/>
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes<br/>
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?<br/>
I notice there's so many of 'em<br/>
And there's really not that many of us.<br/>
and ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.<br/>
It's on till the break of dawn<br/>
And we're starting this party from dusk
