I'm a soldier, i'm a soldier, i'm a soldier, i'm a soldier...<br/>
<br/>
Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns, <br/>
never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one,<br/>
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin', <br/>
took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin', <br/>
willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death, <br/>
never live to regret what I said, <br/>
when you're me, people just want to see, <br/>
if it's true, if it's you, what you say in your rap's, what you do, <br/>
so they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill, <br/>
when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real, <br/>
in confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation, <br/>
any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it, <br/>
if you conceal it, reveal it, being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, <br/>
pull it, squeeze it, till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, <br/>
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge, <br/>
i'll never fall or fold up,<br/>
i'm a soldier, <br/>
even if my collar bone's crush or crumble, <br/>
I will never slip or stumble, <br/>
i'm a soldier, <br/>
these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge, <br/>
i'll never fall or fold up, <br/>
i'm a soldier, <br/>
even if my collar bone's crush or crumble, <br/>
I will never stumble...<br/>
<br/>
I love pissin' you off, it get's me off, <br/>
like my lawyer's, when the fuckin' judge let's me off,<br/>
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off, <br/>
i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bet's be off, <br/>
i'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitche, it's news, <br/>
pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two, <br/>
who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets, <br/>
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully, <br/>
it's actually better cause instead you murderin', <br/>
you can hurt em' and come back again and kick dirt at 'em, <br/>
it's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued, <br/>
you can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room, <br/>
everybody halts and stops, calls the cops,<br/>
all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops, <br/>
runnin' and duckin' out the Hard Rocks parking lot, <br/>
you'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, cause...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em, <br/>
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em, <br/>
i'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence, <br/>
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it, <br/>
you motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it, <br/>
don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it, <br/>
don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest, <br/>
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch, <br/>
so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock, <br/>
listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock, <br/>
listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen, <br/>
motherfuckers know that i'll never be Marshall again, <br/>
full of controversy until I retire my jersey, <br/>
'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty, and<br/>
Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me, <br/>
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, i'm a...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, <br/>
right, left, <br/>
yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, <br/>
right, left, <br/>
yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, <br/>
right, left, <br/>
yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, <br/>
right, left...
