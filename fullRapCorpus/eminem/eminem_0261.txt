<i>[Japanese voice]</i><br/>
Jigoku e iku no wa.. omae ga saki da!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Announcer]</i><br/>
Welcome back, to the stage of history<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Yo.. Slim Shady!<br/>
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..<br/>
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)<br/>
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to<br/>
The only key that I see to defeat you<br/>
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you<br/>
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe<br/>
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse <br/>
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you <br/>
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal <br/>
I ain't tryin to shoot you, <br/>
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you<br/>
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass <br/>
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress<br/>
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)<br/>
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis<br/>
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket<br/>
to fill it full of explosive gasses<br/>
and close it back with a lit match in it <br/>
while I sit back and just hope it catches <br/>
Blow you to fragments<br/>
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
I see the light at the end<br/>
But every time I take a step, it gets dim<br/>
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?<br/>
If so, heaven's got to be better<br/>
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J-Black]</i><br/>
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)<br/>
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse<br/>
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc<br/>
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot<br/>
One day we all gon' die<br/>
But when I die, I'ma be so high<br/>
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare<br/>
with the chalk outline still there<br/>
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot<br/>
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock<br/>
Now if I pray everynight (night)<br/>
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?<br/>
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth<br/>
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse<br/>
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse<br/>
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk<br/>
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface<br/>
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith<br/>
Angels greet me but I don't reply back<br/>
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Announcer]</i><br/>
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns<br/>
Final battle, fight!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Masta Ace]</i><br/>
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso<br/>
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso<br/>
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger<br/>
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger<br/>
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound<br/>
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds<br/>
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger<br/>
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her<br/>
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her<br/>
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager<br/>
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel<br/>
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel<br/>
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder<br/>
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder<br/>
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare<br/>
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[J-Black]</i><br/>
But every time I take a step, it gets dim..<br/>
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?<br/>
Haha..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Announcer]</i><br/>
Time's up!<br/>
You lose!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Japanese woman's voice]</i><br/>
Katta ne.
