<i>[DJ scratching:]</i> "Do it!" <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i> <br/>
Sneakin in through the back door, fruity MC's get ambushed <br/>
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed <br/>
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left <br/>
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death <br/>
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two <br/>
Smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true <br/>
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands <br/>
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans <br/>
I'm stompin, I'm kickin, I'm chokin, I'm stampin em <br/>
clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em <br/>
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts <br/>
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts <br/>
I'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers <br/>
Faster than you could snap your fingers for ransom <br/>
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin <br/>
Survivin by connivin and theivin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ scratching:]</i> "Do it!", "Eat em up" <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i> <br/>
I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters <br/>
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders <br/>
Developin a fear of biterphobia <br/>
I'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya <br/>
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize <br/>
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies <br/>
And I'ma torture, with material iller <br/>
than a stark ravin mad serial killer <br/>
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is <br/>
A major risk to a plagiarist <br/>
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible <br/>
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers <br/>
Hit the source to better my skills, <br/>
I head for the border <br/>
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours <br/>
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse <br/>
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like labradors <br/>
In the range of my double-barrel <br/>
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril <br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ scratching]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i> <br/>
I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires <br/>
Cuz vampires right on my balls like clamp pliers <br/>
And swing on my big thingamajig <br/>
So I'm bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig <br/>
Cause biters are fallin head over heels <br/>
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels <br/>
That's how I became paranoid <br/>
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed <br/>
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate <br/>
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with <br/>
an ultimatum I assault and slayed em <br/>
with rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em <br/>
Energetic and imaginative, <br/>
pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives <br/>
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10 <br/>
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen <br/>
<br/>
