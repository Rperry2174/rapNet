Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws<br/>
Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem...<br/>
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper... Eminem<br/>
Who can say for sure?<br/>
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer<br/>
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use<br/>
Society would reap a great benefit<br/>
<br/>
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets<br/>
Who's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes<br/>
Fuck fuck fuck can't take the stress<br/>
I make a mess, as the day progresses, angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges<br/>
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches with these hedge trimmin' scissors with razor edges<br/>
Imagination's dangerous it's<br/>
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, I guess<br/>
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's<br/>
Despicable I'm sick of just getting pushed it's ridiculous<br/>
I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy this kid just took<br/>
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush<br/>
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook<br/>
This fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook<br/>
He hit me I fell, I got back up all I did was book, now there's using your head<br/>
Mama always said...<br/>
<br/>
If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous<br/>
I'mma prove you wrong<br/>
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus<br/>
I'mma be the bomb<br/>
I'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness<br/>
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward some years later a teenager, this is fun, sweet<br/>
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete<br/>
It's usually once a month, this is some feat<br/>
I've accomplished they stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason? You stumped me<br/>
But how do you get the shit beat outta you, beat down and be upbeat, when you don't have nothing?<br/>
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed<br/>
'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street from jump street<br/>
But if I could just get my head out my ass<br/>
I could accomplish any task<br/>
Practicin' trash talkin'<br/>
In a trance locked in my room, yeah but I got some plans, mama<br/>
These damn rhymes are fallin' outta my pants pocket, I can't stop it<br/>
And I'm startin' to blend in more<br/>
In school this shit helps for sure, I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before<br/>
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch- end of story<br/>
Still in my skull's a vacant empty void been usin' it more as a bin for storage<br/>
Take some inventory<br/>
In this gourde there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword<br/>
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored<br/>
Ironin' board a bench, a wrench, a ore, wench an attention whore<br/>
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain like an independent store<br/>
Something's wrong with my head<br/>
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't, 'cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause mama always said...<br/>
<br/>
If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous<br/>
I'mma prove you wrong<br/>
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus<br/>
I'mma be the bomb<br/>
I'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness<br/>
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."<br/>
<br/>
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm<br/>
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb<br/>
I was on the bottom of the pile gettin' stomped<br/>
But somehow I came out on top<br/>
(Oh-oh-oo-oh)<br/>
<br/>
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo<br/>
I'm nice ya'll, fuck it, I'm out cold<br/>
Now everywhere I go they scream out go, I'm bout to clean house, yo<br/>
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household<br/>
Out sold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America, hear 'em yell out, in terror they were so scared and those kids<br/>
Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird<br/>
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it<br/>
Maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as<br/>
Motherfuckin', difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya<br/>
Little homos get over your fears and phobias<br/>
It's OK to be scared-straight they said I provoked queers<br/>
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's<br/>
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes, yeah<br/>
You motherfuckin' "insert insult here"<br/>
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole' emcee'd<br/>
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?<br/>
And boy, they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked<br/>
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got<br/>
That white-trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin' like six blocks<br/>
From a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid October<br/>
And God forbid I see the Wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all cause<br/>
I'll turn into the Unabomber mama always said...<br/>
<br/>
If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous<br/>
I'mma prove you wrong<br/>
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus<br/>
I'mma be the bomb<br/>
I'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness<br/>
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."<br/>
<br/>
Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck<br/>
Neither is ain't
