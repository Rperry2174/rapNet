<i>[Hook - X Ambassadors:]</i><br/>
I'm getting by with my wicked ways<br/>
I'm loading up and I'm taking names<br/>
I wanna dig my way to hell<br/>
I wanna dig my way to hell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder<br/>
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition<br/>
It's what you're suffering from<br/>
When you simply don't care if it's an<br/>
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning<br/>
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzing<br/>
Cause you got the windows up<br/>
Blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm<br/>
The devil ain't on a level same as him<br/>
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism<br/>
And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping<br/>
So bad they should put his ass in prison<br/>
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs<br/>
Like they did something to me personally<br/>
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it<br/>
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)<br/>
Cadillac from a K Car<br/>
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell em a-part<br/>
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud<br/>
To shop at K-Mart and it became art<br/>
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are<br/>
To this day I, still get in fights with the same broad<br/>
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart<br/>
In the middle of the aisle whilin'<br/>
I don't give a fuck I don't play!<br/>
Bitch you think you saw this basket first?<br/>
You're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay<br/>
Illest shit you could think I would say<br/>
Mind's like a pile of clay<br/>
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape<br/>
Ripped a gaping hole in it<br/>
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes<br/>
Tied 'em around my neck<br/>
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State<br/>
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground<br/>
Splattered all over the entire state<br/>
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates<br/>
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray<br/>
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face<br/>
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot<br/>
But by the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day<br/>
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J<br/>
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical<br/>
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face I'm insane<br/>
Every rhyme I say, sons you like an ultra violet ray<br/>
I’m selling hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat<br/>
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate<br/>
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise<br/>
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition<br/>
In the meantime it’s always mean time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
I’ve been a career asshole<br/>
I don’t see why these people always got my back<br/>
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake<br/>
But I was put here not by accident<br/>
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish<br/>
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit<br/>
I’m coming to get that quarter back<br/>
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build<br/>
Your mama can ask me for my autograph<br/>
Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book<br/>
But I sure would fall for that<br/>
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight<br/>
When I get on the mic I'mma snap<br/>
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital<br/>
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat<br/>
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid<br/>
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate<br/>
If it feels like I'm running away with the game<br/>
It's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate<br/>
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades<br/>
But I get by with my wicked ways<br/>
Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches<br/>
Cry til you get puffy eyes, red faced<br/>
But I'm leaving on this jet plane<br/>
You ain't fly, you're an airhead<br/>
And I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase<br/>
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space<br/>
Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods<br/>
Other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase<br/>
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't<br/>
I need my meds, I peed my bed<br/>
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs<br/>
I keep on falling down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane<br/>
Someone help me, I think my face is melting<br/>
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain<br/>
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head<br/>
If you read my mind, you can see my pain<br/>
And you'd see why I be this way<br/>
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes<br/>
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game<br/>
Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it<br/>
Like a (like a) fucking (fucking)<br/>
Echo (echo)... (Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle<br/>
Spiraling, here I go, I`m outta control like no<br/>
Other mic go, stab you til' the knife goes - dull<br/>
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes<br/>
Coz I'mma sock it to you<br/>
Dyke ho, you don't like it<br/>
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle<br/>
And ride it like a motorbike<br/>
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night so<br/>
Strike up the fucking maestro, I'm nitro<br/>
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole<br/>
Deeper, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Eminem &amp; Ken Kaniff:]</i><br/>
Ohh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty<br/>
Thank you, God<br/>
<i>[Bathroom door opening, someone walks in]</i><br/>
Shit...<br/>
<i>[Sounds of pissing and crapping]</i><br/>
Is that a girl?<br/>
<i>[Ken Kaniff singing:]</i><br/>
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth<br/>
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M<br/>
And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show<br/>
- Why do I know that voice?<br/>
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it<br/>
Life's too short to not stroke your bone<br/>
- Are you fucking serious?<br/>
So everybody, everybody<br/>
Circle jerk, touch my body<br/>
<i>[Doors slam, screaming]</i><br/>
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back<br/>
Why does everyone always leave me?<br/>
Hello? Fuck you then<br/>
<i>[Loud crapping noise]</i><br/>
Blow it out your ass
