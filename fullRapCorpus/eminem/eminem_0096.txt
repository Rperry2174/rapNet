<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The way you shake it, I can't believe it<br/>
I ain't never seen an ass like that<br/>
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go<br/>
Doing, doing, doing<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true<br/>
I ain't never seen an ass like that<br/>
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go<br/>
Doing, doing, doing<br/>
<br/>
The way she moves she's like a belly dancer<br/>
She's shaking that ass to that new nelly jam, I<br/>
Think someones at the door<br/>
But I don't think I'm gonna answer<br/>
Police saying "freeze"<br/>
Doing, doing, doing<br/>
What do you mean freeze?<br/>
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs<br/>
I'm not done, not till I'm finish peeing<br/>
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer<br/>
I'm already on my knees<br/>
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me<br/>
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee, pee, pee<br/>
Yes, I make r&amp;b, I sing song it go<br/>
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching<br/>
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd<br/>
If I offend I'm sorry, please, please forgive<br/>
For I am Triumph, the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet<br/>
I can get away with anything I sing, you will love it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Jessica Simpson, looks oh so temptin'<br/>
Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that<br/>
Everytime I see that show on MTV my pee pee goes<br/>
Doing, doing, doing<br/>
<br/>
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome<br/>
Now they're getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums<br/>
I go to the movies and sit down with my pop corn<br/>
Police saying "freeze"<br/>
Doing doing doing<br/>
What do you mean freeze?<br/>
Geez, I just got my seat<br/>
I have ticket, look, I put away my zipper zipped<br/>
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please<br/>
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene<br/>
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene<br/>
And don't treat me like I'm pee wee herman, this movies PG<br/>
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney<br/>
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free<br/>
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets<br/>
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?<br/>
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man<br/>
And I can say that and you'll laugh cuz that is a puppet on my hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so<br/>
I ain't never seen a butt like that<br/>
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee pee go<br/>
Doing, doing, doing<br/>
<br/>
The way she moves she dances like a go-go<br/>
In that video she sings get out your bozo<br/>
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo<br/>
Police saying "freeze"<br/>
Doing, doing, doing<br/>
What do you mean freeze?<br/>
My computers would be seized and my keys to my ranch<br/>
I just baked cookies Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these<br/>
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this<br/>
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me<br/>
I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee, pee<br/>
On the radio, but I think I did<br/>
Janet, is that a breast, I think I just saw a tit<br/>
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd<br/>
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick<br/>
Get to the chopper, everybody get out<br/>
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee pee on me please?<br/>
I ain't never seen an ass like that<br/>
Cuz the way you move it, you make my pee pee go<br/>
Doing, doing, doing<br/>
<br/>
What the fuck is wrong with you? (ha!)
