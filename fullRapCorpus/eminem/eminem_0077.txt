<i>[Eminem singing]</i><br/>
<br/>
There's an intruder<br/>
in my house<br/>
He cut my phone-lines<br/>
can't dial out<br/>
I scream for police<br/>
but I doubt<br/>
They're gonna hear me<br/>
when I shout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[rapping]</i><br/>
<br/>
A couple of cocktails will send me to jail<br/>
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail<br/>
But this time, when I get pulled over<br/>
there's a doberman pincher and a pitbull in the seat<br/>
these pigs 'll get bit fooling with me<br/>
quit fooling with me<br/>
Bitch, you're gonna see<br/>
No pistol in the seat<br/>
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me<br/>
and which you're gonna see in the long run<br/>
Im'a be the wrong one<br/>
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass<br/>
flashing that flash-light on my ass where was you at<br/>
last night when them assholes<br/>
ran up on my grass<br/>
rapper slash actor<br/>
kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass<br/>
they took away my right to bear arms<br/>
what I'm 'posed to fight with bare palms?<br/>
yeah right<br/>
they coming with bombs, I'm coming with flare-guns<br/>
We as Americans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
We as a Americans<br/>
Us as a citizen<br/>
Gotta protect ourselves<br/>
Look at how shit has been<br/>
We better check ourselves<br/>
Living up in these streets<br/>
Through worse and through better health<br/>
Surviving by any means<br/>
We as Americans<br/>
Us as a citizen<br/>
We are Samaritans<br/>
What do we get us in<br/>
We better check ourselves<br/>
Look at how shit has been<br/>
Take a look where you live<br/>
This is America<br/>
And we are Americans<br/>
<br/>
Im'a make buku bucks<br/>
wearing buku vests<br/>
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex<br/>
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest<br/>
but you know who<br/>
with an "S" tattooed to my chest<br/>
But I've finessed<br/>
Now I got the Industry pissy<br/>
ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny<br/>
We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty<br/>
Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents<br/>
I'd rather see the president dead<br/>
It's never been said<br/>
but I set precedents and the standards<br/>
and they can't stand it<br/>
My name should've been bastard<br/>
the shit should've been plastered<br/>
on my forehead with a stamp<br/>
I should've been blasted<br/>
I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass<br/>
but I'm too swift and fast<br/>
for that, I'm past it<br/>
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot<br/>
Fuck that shit<br/>
I done seen how fast this rap shit<br/>
can turn into some pap-pap shit<br/>
that quick<br/>
snap click<br/>
but this time they got fucking auto-ma-tic<br/>
(Jamaican) and no one gon' test this mon<br/>
Clack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We as a Americans<br/>
Us as a citizen<br/>
Gotta protect ourselves<br/>
Look at how shit has been<br/>
We better check ourselves<br/>
Living up in these streets<br/>
Through worse and through better health<br/>
Surviving by any means<br/>
We as Americans<br/>
Us as a citizen<br/>
We are Samaritans<br/>
What do we get us in<br/>
We better check ourselves<br/>
Look at how shit has been<br/>
Take a look where you live<br/>
This is America<br/>
And we are Americans<br/>
<br/>
(SSHHH)<br/>
I got a secret if you can keep it between us<br/>
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis<br/>
under my Long Johns<br/>
under my Sean Johns<br/>
when running with the long arm of the law I'm long gone<br/>
Im'a do five years no less than that<br/>
no questions asked<br/>
it might be a good idea to stop right here<br/>
and quit while I'm ahead<br/>
already in the red<br/>
already got a steady infrared meant for my head<br/>
A target on my back<br/>
bigger problems than that<br/>
Bin Laden on my ass<br/>
he probably gone send a task<br/>
I ain't gone even ask<br/>
they ain't gone let me pack<br/>
they ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my Whizz at<br/>
<br/>
We as a Americans<br/>
Us as a citizen<br/>
Gotta protect ourselves<br/>
Look at how shit has been<br/>
We better check ourselves<br/>
Living up in these streets<br/>
Through worse and through better health<br/>
Surviving by any means<br/>
We are Americans<br/>
Us as a citizen<br/>
We as Samaritans<br/>
What do we get us in<br/>
We better check ourselves<br/>
Look at how shit has been<br/>
Take a look where you live<br/>
This is America<br/>
And we are Americans
