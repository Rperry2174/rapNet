Good evening! This is your fucking captain speaking<br/>
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet <br/>
That's eight million miles in the sky<br/>
Please, undo your seatbelt for takeoff<br/>
You are now free to smoke about the cabin <br/>
<br/>
I'm Dre from back in the day from NWA from black and the gray from <br/>
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from<br/>
Stacking up bodies to <br/>
Racking their kegs up from Racking a bitch to<br/>
Stacking them crates up <br/>
I'm still hungry <br/>
And I'm back with a tapeworm <br/>
And we was happening and rapping and tame at me <br/>
Shady for us competition  Faggot, There ain't none <br/>
Speak of the devil  It's attack of the rain man <br/>
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron <br/>
Soon as the blade spun run, they run away from<br/>
 Who wanna play dungeon? <br/>
No one is safe from  In search of a brain surgeon <br/>
A great one <br/>
Wait, the day ain't funny man  It's urgent <br/>
I need one <br/>
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun <br/>
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1 <br/>
<br/>
So one more time for old time's sake <br/>
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake <br/>
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way And let's go <br/>
You are now smoking with the best (the best) <br/>
<br/>
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless<br/>
A nice environment <br/>
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants <br/>
Taking lives of firemen Say goodbye, here I am again Naked wives and vicadin <br/>
Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin Fin, fin <br/>
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him <br/>
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again <br/>
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin <br/>
I show you every inch grows of my foreskin <br/>
Show me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten <br/>
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again <br/>
The sorcerer of intercourse - if it's forced, it's him <br/>
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within <br/>
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain <br/>
<br/>
So one more time for old time's sake<br/>
 Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake <br/>
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way<br/>
And let's go You are now smoking with the best (the best)<br/>
<br/>
Now where there's smoke, there's fire Where there's fire, there's flames <br/>
Where there's flames, there's chronic<br/>
Either you high or you ain't <br/>
I got no time for no games Nah uh, he ain't playin'<br/>
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain I'm slightly insane Vodka and kreatine Hypnotic and red bull <br/>
It's an incredible energy drink And it's given me wings I believe I can fly <br/>
While I pee on a girl You won't catch me, CSI It's as easy as pie <br/>
And as simple as cake Dre, get on the mic and make them dribble and shake <br/>
<br/>
Now put your smoke up in the air And raise your henny and coke <br/>
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know<br/>
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it<br/>
Lets get into it You smoking with the triest and truest <br/>
I got the Midas touch When it comes to rolling shit up<br/>
You motherfuckas ain't smoking <br/>
You just holding shit up Now here we go<br/>
Let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt <br/>
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one<br/>
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed<br/>
Now them words are just a little more personal for me<br/>
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees Well puffing ain't enough for me <br/>
Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on Smoke me out, cuz<br/>
Give me contact buzz <br/>
Get me on track They love me when I'm on that stuff<br/>
But this earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)<br/>
Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back (fuck!) <br/>
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches)<br/>
Dre, it's hot <br/>
I think we better go check on their temperatures I give them the thermometer <br/>
You get the bandages Now baby just bend over<br/>
This won't hurt a damn bit, <br/>
<br/>
And give me one more time for old time's sake Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake <br/>
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way<br/>
And let's go<br/>
You are now smoking with the best (the best) <br/>
I said one more time for old time's sake Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake<br/>
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way<br/>
And let's go <br/>
You are now smoking with the best (the best)
