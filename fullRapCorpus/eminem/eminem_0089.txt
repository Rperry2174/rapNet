<i>[Sounds of someone puking]</i><br/>
<br/>
There I go--thinking of you again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You don't know how sick you make me<br/>
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach<br/>
Every time I think of you, I puke<br/>
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br/>
You may not think you do, but you do<br/>
Every time I think of you I puke<br/>
<br/>
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem<br/>
But off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable for this type of song--whoa<br/>
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of<br/>
Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta<br/>
So fuck it, I'ma start right here I'll just be brief I'm<br/>
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons<br/>
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you<br/>
On my arm, but what do I go and do<br/>
I go and get another one, now I got two<br/>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin<br/>
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again<br/>
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim<br/>
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it<br/>
If you only knew how much I hated you<br/>
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through<br/>
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you<br/>
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You don't know how sick you make me<br/>
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach<br/>
Every time I think of you, I puke<br/>
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br/>
You may not think you do, but you do<br/>
Every time I think of you I puke<br/>
<br/>
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter<br/>
But I thought a song would probably be a little better<br/>
Instead of a letter<br/>
That you'd probably just shred up--yeah<br/>
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of<br/>
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a<br/>
Paper, I'd rather let you see how<br/>
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle<br/>
You're a fuckin' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin' die<br/>
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye<br/>
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you die<br/>
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie<br/>
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad<br/>
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back<br/>
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna<br/>
Gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag<br/>
What else can I do, I haven't got a clue<br/>
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to<br/>
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do<br/>
Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You don't know how sick you make me<br/>
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach<br/>
Every time I think of you, I puke<br/>
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br/>
You may not think you do, but you do<br/>
Every time I think of you, I puke<br/>
<br/>
Fuckin' bitch
