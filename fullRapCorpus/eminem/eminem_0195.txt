<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
(What's your name?) Marshall<br/>
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one<br/>
My mother reproduced like the Komodo Dragon<br/>
And had me on the back of a motorcycle<br/>
Then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap, I'm loco<br/>
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun<br/>
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum<br/>
About to explode all over the canvas<br/>
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm<br/>
(Your music usually has them)<br/>
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)<br/>
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)<br/>
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining<br/>
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and<br/>
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting<br/>
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk<br/>
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog<br/>
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on (oh..)<br/>
Its on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small<br/>
(It says) Ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls<br/>
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to die hard<br/>
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card<br/>
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams<br/>
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, I don't care, don't have two shits to give<br/>
Let me take you by the hand, to promise land, and threaten everyone<br/>
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Nah, (What's your name?) Marshall<br/>
(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder<br/>
(Is he rich like me?) Ha ha<br/>
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)<br/>
NO<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad<br/>
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad<br/>
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens<br/>
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and<br/>
Makes you want to get up and start dancing<br/>
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, to be rapping<br/>
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank<br/>
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I'm in the style department<br/>
With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart<br/>
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content<br/>
Completely, despondent, and condescending<br/>
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a<br/>
Beat killing spree, your honor, I must plead<br/>
Guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution<br/>
Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap<br/>
To take it to the next level, boost it<br/>
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it<br/>
(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?<br/>
'Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns<br/>
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?<br/>
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper<br/>
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch<br/>
'Cause it's theâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
It's the time of the season, when hate runs high<br/>
And this time I won't give it to you easy<br/>
When I take back what's mine, with pleasured hands<br/>
And torture everyone, that is my plan, my job here isn't done<br/>
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
(Whats your name?) Shady<br/>
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder<br/>
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha<br/>
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So yeah dad let's walk<br/>
Let's have us a father and son talk<br/>
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block<br/>
Without me knocking your block off<br/>
This is all your fault<br/>
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas<br/>
I appeal to all those walks of life<br/>
Whoever had strife<br/>
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like<br/>
'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America<br/>
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles<br/>
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again<br/>
It's hysterical, I chuckle<br/>
'Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles<br/>
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckle heads<br/>
The sign on my hustle says "Don't knock"<br/>
The door's broken, it won't lock<br/>
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked<br/>
You critics come pay to me a visit<br/>
Misery loves company, please stay a minute<br/>
Kryptonite to a hypocrite<br/>
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it<br/>
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house<br/>
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out<br/>
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers<br/>
So spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out<br/>
Completely brain dead Rainman<br/>
Doing the Bankhead in a restraint chair<br/>
So bitch, shoot me a look it better be a blank stare<br/>
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than<br/>
All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef<br/>
'Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah<br/>
Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look<br/>
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there<br/>
I still am a criminal<br/>
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals<br/>
The last Mathers LP done went diamond<br/>
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald<br/>
When will the madness end, how can it when<br/>
There's no method the pad and pen<br/>
The only message that I have to send<br/>
Is "Dad, I'm back at it again."<br/>
Bitch (who's your daddy?)
