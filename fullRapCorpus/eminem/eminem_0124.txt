<i>[Jay-Z: Verse]</i><br/>
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels(bling bling)<br/>
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?<br/>
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined<br/>
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing<br/>
What I do, through and through and I gave you the news with a twist it's just his ghetto point of view<br/>
The renegade you been afraid<br/>
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they<br/>
pop toasters, and they live with their mums<br/>
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggas crotched over<br/>
Mummy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over<br/>
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked<br/>
No, he's not around now how that sound to ya, jot it down<br/>
I'll bring you through the ghetto without riding round<br/>
hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in their ways<br/>
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day<br/>
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it?<br/>
I help them see they way through it, not you.<br/>
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes<br/>
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem: Verse]</i><br/>
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen<br/>
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it within a minute<br/>
Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it<br/>
But if it don't, then ya'll swallow the truth grin and bear it<br/>
Now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics?<br/>
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics?<br/>
Using his music to steer it sharing his views and his merits<br/>
But there's a huge interference, they're saying, "You shouldn't hear it."<br/>
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit<br/>
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish<br/>
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America<br/>
as a motherfucking drug addict like you didn't experiment?<br/>
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror<br/>
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed<br/>
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents<br/>
You fucking do-gooders - too bad you couldn't DO-GOOD at marriage!<br/>
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't<br/>
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo<br/>
Cause here we go, he's {Jigga durra Jigga da chk Jigga}<br/>
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the..<br/>

<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
RENEGADE! Never been afraid to say<br/>
what's on my mind at, any given time of day<br/>
Cause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talk<br/>
about anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Never been afraid to say<br/>
what's on my mind at, any given time of day<br/>
Cause I'm a (RENEGADE) Never been afraid to holler<br/>
about anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z: Verse]</i><br/>
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles<br/>
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent<br/>
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench<br/>
What you hollering? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in<br/>
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver<br/>
Doo-rag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope<br/>
Do not step to me I'm awkward, I box leftier often<br/>
My pops left me and often my momma wasn't home<br/>
Could not stress to me I wasn't growing, especially on nights<br/>
I brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings<br/>
My demeanor thirty years my senior<br/>
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin greener<br/>
Raising my fingers to critics, raising my head to the sky<br/>
Big I did it multi(i) before I die (nigga)<br/>
No lie, just know I chose my own fate<br/>
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem: Verse]</i><br/>
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare<br/>
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here<br/>
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me<br/>
as a monger of hate, Satan and scatter-brained atheist<br/>
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste<br/>
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is<br/>
Or is he the ladder, a gateway to escape?<br/>
Media scapegoat, they can be mad at today<br/>
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie<br/>
while I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me<br/>
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics<br/>
in holy water no wonder they try to hold me under longer<br/>
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful<br/>
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you<br/>
What did I do? (huh) I'm just a kid from the gutter<br/>
making his butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a motherfucking<br/>
<br/>
