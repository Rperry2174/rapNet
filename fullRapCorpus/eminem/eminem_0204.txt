<i>[Hook - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br/>
Get along with the voices inside of my head<br/>
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath<br/>
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek<br/>
Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey<br/>
Wanted to receive attention for my music<br/>
Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me<br/>
For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways<br/>
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated<br/>
When I blew; see, but it was confusing<br/>
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf<br/>
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)<br/>
Hit the lottery, oh wee<br/>
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet<br/>
It was like winning a used mink<br/>
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink<br/>
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep<br/>
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith<br/>
But I'm actually weirder than you think<br/>
'Cause I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br/>
Get along with the voices inside of my head<br/>
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath<br/>
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's nothing<br/>
Well, that's nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me<br/>
To seize the moment and don't squander it<br/>
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow<br/>
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from<br/>
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.<br/>
No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)<br/>
Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo<br/>
I think it went wandering off down yonder<br/>
And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen<br/>
'Cause I need an interventionist<br/>
To intervene between me and this monster<br/>
And save me from myself and all this conflict<br/>
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it<br/>
My OCD's conking me in the head<br/>
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking<br/>
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying<br/>
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br/>
Get along with the voices inside of my head<br/>
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath<br/>
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's nothing<br/>
Well, that's nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Call me crazy but I have this vision<br/>
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian<br/>
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at<br/>
MC's, blood get spilled and I'll<br/>
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track<br/>
Give every kid who got played that<br/>
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back<br/>
To the kids who played him<br/>
I ain't here to save the fucking children<br/>
But if one kid out of a hundred million<br/>
Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great<br/>
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back<br/>
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that<br/>
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack<br/>
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts<br/>
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that<br/>
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the<br/>
<br/>

Well, that's nothing<br/>
Well, that's nothing
