<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
A lot of people ask me.. stupid fucking questions<br/>
A lot of people think that.. what I say on records<br/>
or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life<br/>
or that I believe in it<br/>
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that..<br/>
I'm actually gonna do it<br/>
or that I believe in it<br/>
Well, shit.. if you believe that<br/>
then I'll kill you<br/>
You know why?<br/>
Cause I'm a<br/>
<br/>
CRIMINAL<br/>
CRIMINAL<br/>
You god damn right<br/>
I'm a CRIMINAL<br/>
Yeah, I'm a CRIMINAL<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge<br/>
That'll stab you in the head<br/>
whether you're a fag or lez<br/>
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest<br/>
Pants or dress - hate fags? The answer's "yes"<br/>
Homophobic?  Nah, you're just heterophobic<br/>
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging (Ooh!)<br/>
That's my motherfucking balls, you'd better let go of em<br/>
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of em<br/>
Hey, it's me, Versace<br/>
Whoops, somebody shot me!<br/>
And I was just checking the mail<br/>
Get it?  Checking the 'male'?<br/>
How many records you expecting to sell<br/>
after your second LP sends you directly to jail?<br/>
C'mon!-- Relax guy, I like gay men<br/>
Right, Ken?  Give me an amen (AAA-men!)<br/>
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus<br/>
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons<br/>
Oh, and please send me a brand new car<br/>
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital<br/>
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher<br/>
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither<br/>
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause<br/>
I watch TV, and Comcast cable<br/>
and you ain't able to stop these thoughts<br/>
You can't stop me from topping these charts<br/>
And you can't stop me from dropping each March<br/>
with a brand new CD for these fucking retards<br/>
Duhhh, and to think, it's just little ol' me<br/>
Mr. "Don't Give A Fuck," still won't leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm a CRIMINAL<br/>
Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime<br/>
to tell em what's on my mind - I guess I'm a CRIMINAL<br/>
but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird<br/>
and keep going, I don't take shit from no one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
My mother did drugs - hard-liquor, cigarettes, and speed<br/>
The baby came out - disfigured, ligaments indeed<br/>
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she<br/>
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me<br/>
I'm a CRIMINAL - an animal caged who turned crazed<br/>
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?<br/>
So as I got older and I got a lot taller<br/>
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger<br/>
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker<br/>
than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word ...<br/>
My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral<br/>
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk<br/>
Off of his own employee<br/>
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me<br/>
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired<br/>
and my nose is pointy<br/>
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die<br/>
in plane crashes and laughs<br/>
As long as it ain't happened to him<br/>
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em<br/>
-inem and Kim combined - <i>[*kch*]</i> the maniac's in<br/>
Replacing the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today<br/>
He's a little under the weather, so I'm taking his place<br/>
(Mm-mm-mmm!) Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face<br/>
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place<br/>
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away<br/>
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?<br/>
I'm a CRIMINAL<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude Skit]</i><br/>
Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker<br/>
get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there<br/>
<i>[Em]</i> Aight<br/>
I'll be right here waiting on you<br/>
<i>[Em]</i> Aight<br/>
Yo Em<br/>
<i>[Em]</i> What?!<br/>
Don't kill nobody this time<br/>
<i>[Em]</i> Awwright... god damn, fuck...<br/>
(whistling) how you doin'?<br/>
<i>[Teller]</i> HI, how can I help you?<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Yeah I need to make a withdrawl<br/>
<i>[Teller]</i> Okay<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Put the fucking money in the bag bitch<br/>
and I won't kill you!<br/>
<i>[Teller]</i> What?  Oh my god, don't kill me<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around...<br/>
<i>[Teller]</i> Don't kill me, please don't kill me...<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you<br/>
Hurry the fuck up! <i>[*BOOM*]</i> Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it<br/>
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it<br/>
So I'll be disguised in it<br/>
And if anybody identifies the guy in it<br/>
I'll hide for five minutes<br/>
Come back, shoot the eyewitness<br/>
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business<br/>
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets<br/>
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet <i>[*dog whines*]</i><br/>
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts<br/>
tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck<br/>
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough<br/>
to say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut <i>[*tape unrolls*]</i><br/>
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up<br/>
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass<br/>
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as<br/>
I'ma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
