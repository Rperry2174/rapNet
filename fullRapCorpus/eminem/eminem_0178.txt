<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
The days are cold living without you (without you)<br/>
The nights are long I'm growing older<br/>
I miss the days of old thinking about you (about you)<br/>
You may be gone but you're never over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
If Proof could see me now I know he'd be proud<br/>
Somewhere in me deep down there's something in me he found<br/>
That made him believe in me now no one can beat me now<br/>
You try it'll be them doors on Dre's fans believe me clowns<br/>
That means suicide homie you'll never throw me<br/>
Off of this course blow me<br/>
Bitch I do this all for the sport only<br/>
But I want it all I'm not just talking awards homie<br/>
And the balls in my court and it's lonely<br/>
On top of the world when you're the only<br/>
One with the balls in your shorts<br/>
To leave their jaws on the floors with no re<br/>
Morse remember that when they get to dogging you boy homie<br/>
So ya all can just get to blogging about bologna I'm not gonna stop the saga continues<br/>
No stopping the force Obi<br/>
I'm mopping the floors with em<br/>
I keep trying to pass it but they keep on dropping the torch and it won't be long til this sport is O-V-E-R<br/>
just Blaze and me we are knocking on doors and no we<br/>
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be<br/>
Careful what you say there ain't no punks over here so follow me<br/>
Through the fog like I'm S-N double O-P<br/>
Let me guide you through the smoke G<br/>
If only I wasn't travelling down this road by my lonely<br/>
No one who knew me like you will ever know me<br/>
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
The days are cold living without you (without you)<br/>
The nights are long I'm growing older<br/>
I miss the days of old thinking about you (about you)<br/>
You may be gone but you're never over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And it don't stop oh<br/>
And it don't quit oh<br/>
And it don't stop oh<br/>
And it don't quit oh<br/>
And I miss you oh<br/>
I just miss you oh<br/>
I just miss you oh<br/>
Homie I'll never forget you no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life<br/>
So sick it'll blow up the mic It'll put the dyna in mite<br/>
Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself<br/>
Tap dancing all over the beat it'll jump off the page and spit itself<br/>
Guess that the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rap<br/>
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die yeah I'm a do it to death<br/>
And instead of mourning your death I'd rather celebrate your life<br/>
Elevate to new heights step on the gas and accelerate I'm a need 2 mics<br/>
Cause the way that I'm feeling tonight everything I can just do right<br/>
There's nothing that I can do wrong I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped<br/>
Just finish the rhyme and bust it excuse this corny metaphor<br/>
But they'll never ketchup to all this energy that I've mustard<br/>
So God just help me out while I fight through this grieving process<br/>
Trying to process this loss is making me nauseous<br/>
But this depression ain't taking me hostage<br/>
I've been patiently watching this game pacing these hallways<br/>
You had faith in me always<br/>
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump rise from these ashes<br/>
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards<br/>
And I'm a show em blow em out the water slaughter em homes<br/>
I'm a own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below em<br/>
Homie I know I'm never gonna be the same without you<br/>
I never would've came in this game I'm going insane without you<br/>
Matter of fact it was just the other night had another dream about you<br/>
You told me to get up I got up I spread my wings and I flew<br/>
You gave me a reason to fight I was on my way to see you<br/>
You told me nah Doody you're not laying on that table I knew<br/>
I was gonna make it soon as you said think of Hailie I knew<br/>
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies and Proof<br/>
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you<br/>
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do<br/>
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through<br/>
So homie this is your song I dedicate this to you<br/>
I love you Doody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
The days are cold living without you (without you)<br/>
The nights are long I'm growing older<br/>
I miss the days of old thinking about you (about you)<br/>
You may be gone but you're never over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And it don't stop oh<br/>
And it don't quit oh<br/>
And it don't stop oh<br/>
And it don't quit oh<br/>
And I miss you oh<br/>
I just miss you oh<br/>
I just miss you oh<br/>
Homie I'll never forget you no
