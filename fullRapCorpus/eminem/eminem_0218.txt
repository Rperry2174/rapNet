Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though<br/>
Oh well, this is my life so<br/>
As I go and try to close for the night's show<br/>
See how far that line goes<br/>
Still blows my mind show<br/>
Business guess I'll just never get<br/>
So this shit just always feels so weird<br/>
To this day because all I ever did<br/>
Was just say the shit I wouldve wanted to hear<br/>
Other people say to me when I was a kid<br/>
So please don't make me some type of hero<br/>
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way<br/>
But still will have a field day with some of the<br/>
Fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick<br/>
Cause I still make fun of a sit.<br/>
Someone's in like a son of a bitch<br/>
At another's expense, I'm fuckin' relentless<br/>
As fuck when it comes to this pen<br/>
I struggle with coming to my senses<br/>
Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced<br/>
It's challenging but my conscience allows me to think<br/>
The most foulish childish things without even blinking<br/>
Without even thinkin' about, all the stinkin' amounts of people that seem to be reachin' in the crowds<br/>
I'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening<br/>
But now it's, lay me down to sleeping<br/>
Is it really my soul to keep or<br/>
Have I sold it cheap is it greed<br/>
Do I take more than I need<br/>
When I joke about leavin'<br/>
But keep over achievin'<br/>
Because what's stolen from me barely broke even<br/>
<br/>
It's a fine, fine line<br/>
It's a fine, fine line<br/>
<br/>
So I notice how I paint myself<br/>
And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain<br/>
I want my respect but ignore the<br/>
Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect<br/>
Till I, sit in the dark and I reflect<br/>
And my reflection shows what it's like here<br/>
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights yeah<br/>
It's like a nightmare<br/>
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare<br/>
And I don't like how I see myself so I<br/>
Open the Bible to Isaiah cause<br/>
I swear to Christ there are nights where<br/>
I stay up at night just to say a prayer twice<br/>
Just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer<br/>
Ice skate on the nice way<br/>
Puting it but I like staying<br/>
Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player<br/>
I got a nice pair of dice here<br/>
Sealed off in my lair<br/>
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit<br/>
From in this house it's quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it<br/>
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it<br/>
But it's like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it<br/>
So I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it<br/>
Then I wonder why I stay famous<br/>
Keep walkin' the line<br/>
This gold fish poke gets old<br/>
But especially when you don't know<br/>
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so<br/>
You don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier<br/>
Or if you sold your soul<br/>
<br/>
It's a fine, fine line<br/>
It's a fine, fine line<br/>
<br/>
And from here you look so small<br/>
Hovering high above us all<br/>
Please come back, to me<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the times when<br/>
They were, simpler than the rhymes of<br/>
Vanilla Ice were, when I was just killin' the mics<br/>
I'll never forget what that feeling was like I,<br/>
Miss those times now when I was just starting out<br/>
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond<br/>
Can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been<br/>
Stuck in this house hibernatin'<br/>
Hate even going outside it<br/>
Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'<br/>
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it<br/>
Look how excited, I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and<br/>
Everything about it I miss<br/>
Which now reminds me<br/>
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz<br/>
Wow, I must have had Alzheimers<br/>
Long time since I shouted them out, bout time<br/>
Cause it's been on my mind lately how<br/>
Zee you always supported me<br/>
You vouched, I will never forget that and<br/>
How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace<br/>
I love you too, you slept on my couch<br/>
And I been thinkin' bout the time I slept on the floor at the outhouse<br/>
Rhyming is all we ever wanted to do<br/>
And regardless how life has turned out<br/>
Inside I'll always be an outsider<br/>
My life has been turned inside out but I<br/>
<br/>
It's a fine, fine line<br/>
It's a fine, fine line
