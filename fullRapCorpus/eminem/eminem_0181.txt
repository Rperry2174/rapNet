<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noooooise!<br/>
Aww shit, yeah<br/>
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?<br/>
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too<br/>
<br/>
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin I'm back<br/>
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks<br/>
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black<br/>
out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac<br/>
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin<br/>
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin<br/>
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin<br/>
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!<br/>
What's occurin befo', after and durin the show<br/>
has no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa<br/>
What is it, wordplay? No I'm pushin you out the do'<br/>
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow<br/>
Now stomp your fuckin feet 'til you get to squishin a hoe<br/>
It's pandemo-nium standin know when you see him, oh<br/>
Damn baby you look good, you're givin me wood<br/>
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood<br/>
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both<br/>
Break bread while I'm coppin over this game to pinch a loaf<br/>
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?<br/>
Who claims to be spittin the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed<br/>
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas<br/>
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash<br/>
Went through 'em and laughed<br/>
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!<br/>
So stop fakin the funk and start shakin your ass<br/>
Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap<br/>
and Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin than that?<br/>
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce Da 5'9"]</i><br/>
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you<br/>
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool<br/>
Designed by a cartoon<br/>
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall<br/>
The 9 tucked against the linin<br/>
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69'in<br/>
It's like Rick James is shootin up your house nigga!<br/>
<i>[rapid gunfire]</i> FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!<br/>
You're screamin fuck the world with your middle finger up<br/>
While I'm over here shovin my dick in a hole in the mud<br/>
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder<br/>
because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove<br/>
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns<br/>
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds<br/>
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred, immune in mad cerebral<br/>
You on your last burrito!<br/>
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eatin<br/>
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern<br/>
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touchin that<br/>
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the FUCK you at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joell Ortiz]</i><br/>
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years<br/>
ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare<br/>
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares<br/>
I harbor the art, of you nice swear {?}<br/>
It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear<br/>
Uncle Al's breath after polishin off his ninth beer<br/>
Homie chill, listen, I swear<br/>
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears<br/>
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?<br/>
Just waitin to be hooked to IV as {?} as well when you look at my pee<br/>
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction<br/>
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine<br/>
This isn't just an infection<br/>
This won't go away with penicillin injections<br/>
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit<br/>
seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it<br/>
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen<br/>
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem<br/>
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgustin hook<br/>
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Crooked I]</i><br/>
I'm right here lettin the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop<br/>
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop<br/>
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop<br/>
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped<br/>
I take your life to the ninth inning<br/>
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin<br/>
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny<br/>
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money<br/>
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches<br/>
then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala<br/>
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas<br/>
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah<br/>
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun<br/>
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn<br/>
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con<br/>
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!<br/>
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flyin<br/>
We do it to try to do without tryin<br/>
(Slaughterhouse!) Cause to it's us it's so easy<br/>
Where's, Jumpoff Joe Beezy?
