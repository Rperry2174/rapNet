<i>[Ozzy]</i><br/>
I'm going through changes<br/>
I'm going through changes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for delf like Philly,<br/>
feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely<br/>
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining,<br/>
But life keeps on complicating, and I'm debating,<br/>
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls<br/>
Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it,<br/>
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,<br/>
When inside I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help.<br/>
can't do it myself, too weak, two weeks I've been having ups and downs,<br/>
going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,<br/>
round with the idea of ending the shit right here.<br/>
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,<br/>
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?<br/>
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie,<br/>
I'm afraid if I close my eyes and I might see her,<br/>
Shit...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon,<br/>
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you.<br/>
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills,<br/>
And you falling off with yer skills, and your own fans are laughin' at you?<br/>
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up,<br/>
Be a man, stand, a real man would've had this shit handled.<br/>
(I) know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,<br/>
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust,<br/>
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,<br/>
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first,<br/>
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse,<br/>
Now I'm popping Vic's, Perks and Methadone pills.<br/>
"Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it"<br/>
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men,<br/>
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it,<br/>
It's in their best interest to protect their investment.<br/>
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(don't know what I'm gonna do, but I just keep on going through changes)<br/>
<br/>
My friends can't understand this new me,<br/>
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be,<br/>
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.<br/>
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?<br/>
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is<br/>
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse to be at a all time low.<br/>
I sit alone in my home theater watchin' the same damn DVD<br/>
Of the first tour, the last tour he was still alive.<br/>
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleepin' pills will make me feel alright.<br/>
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,<br/>
I'll just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,<br/>
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.<br/>
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out<br/>
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.<br/>
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice,<br/>
Yeah baby hold me down.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(don't know what I'm gonna do, but I just keep on going through changes)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through.<br/>
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof.<br/>
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few<br/>
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.<br/>
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through?<br/>
I think about the things I would have never got to say to you,<br/>
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do.<br/>
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina, too,<br/>
I still love your mother, that'll never change,<br/>
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.<br/>
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,<br/>
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day.<br/>
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains,<br/>
guess it pours, yes, it does, wish there wasn't any pain.<br/>
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame,<br/>
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows I've never been a saint.<br/>
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,<br/>
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say,<br/>
"I miss you" subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way.<br/>
But I just had to get away, don't know why,<br/>
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(don't know what I'm gonna do, but I just keep on going through changes)
