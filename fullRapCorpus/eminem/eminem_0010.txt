<i>[Men singing:]</i><br/>
Jealous! <i>[8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Girls voice: (Talking over the singing)]</i><br/>
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?<br/>
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?<br/>
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!<br/>
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick<br/>
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?<br/>
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time<br/>
He has no career move, I mean...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I come home every single day from working double shifts<br/>
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts<br/>
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me<br/>
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously<br/>
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me<br/>
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me<br/>
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues<br/>
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse<br/>
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me<br/>
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things<br/>
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me<br/>
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me<br/>
I used to love your company now you always bugging me <br/>
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me<br/>
So I'ma wait for your evacuation<br/>
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in<br/>
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure<br/>
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure<br/>
I recommend you take your things and check them in<br/>
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Men Singing]</i><br/>
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy <i>[8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Women's Voice: (Talking over singing)]</i><br/>
Fuck you and what you going through<br/>
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man<br/>
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money<br/>
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang<br/>
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night<br/>
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about<br/>
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments<br/>
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense<br/>
Until the day I started following your feetprints<br/>
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents<br/>
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like <br/>
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?<br/>
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga** <br/>
Someone rich that I could follow<br/>
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow<br/>
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted<br/>
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started<br/>
I was an open target, you play comedian<br/>
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again<br/>
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife<br/>
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife<br/>
He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"<br/>
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down<br/>
You run me down and now your trying to apologize<br/>
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes<br/>
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it<br/>
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Men Singing]</i><br/>
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy <i>[12X]</i>
