<i>[Bizzare:]</i><br/>
<i>[Echo]</i><br/>
Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference<br/>
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids<br/>
Sike!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow<br/>
Would you feel sorrow or show love<br/>
Or would it matter<br/>
Can never be the lead-off batter of things<br/>
Shit for me to feed off<br/>
I'm see-saw battling<br/>
But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake<br/>
There's too much on my plate<br/>
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away<br/>
And not say what I got to say<br/>
What the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smoking crack?<br/>
Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back<br/>
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground, 'for I put some wack shit out<br/>
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark<br/>
You all steady trying to drown the shark<br/>
Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off<br/>
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off<br/>
See me leap out, pull the piece out, fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out<br/>
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle<br/>
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap<br/>
You're slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?<br/>
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that<br/>
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,<br/>
This is crazy the way we act<br/>
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swift:]</i><br/>
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh<br/>
If so you would've tried<br/>
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide<br/>
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,<br/>
Got drunk then I finished he<br/>
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.<br/>
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef<br/>
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently<br/>
I'm not what you think<br/>
I appear to be fucked up<br/>
Mentally endangered<br/>
I can't stay away from a razor<br/>
I just want my face in a paper<br/>
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres<br/>
I murder you<br/>
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical<br/>
I'll allergic to dying, you think not? you got balls? We can see how large<br/>
When the music stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kon Artist:]</i><br/>
I was happy having a deal at first,<br/>
Thought money would make me happy but<br/>
It only made my pain worst,<br/>
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg<br/>
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls<br/>
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends<br/>
Beggin' with they hands out<br/>
Checking for your record when its selling<br/>
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs<br/>
No friends no girl<br/>
Just the gin you drink till you car spin you then<br/>
<i>[Screech]</i><br/>
Damn!<br/>
<i>[Crash]</i><br/>
U slam into the wall and you fall<br/>
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm<br/>
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol<br/>
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kuniva:]</i><br/>
Let's see how many of your men loyal,<br/>
When I pull up looking for you,<br/>
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil<br/>
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode<br/>
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon<br/>
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you<br/>
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance<br/>
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man<br/>
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really<br/>
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk<br/>
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark<br/>
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic<br/>
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like<br/>
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night<br/>
<br/>
When The Music Stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Proof:]</i><br/>
Instigators, turn pits in cages<br/>
Let loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors<br/>
You all don't want war, you want talk<br/>
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof<br/>
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof<br/>
Caved in like reindeer hoofs<br/>
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose<br/>
The more you all breach, the more I moves<br/>
This hill street, this is hardcore blues<br/>
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)<br/>
Or make the news betcha all you all move<br/>
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bizzare:]</i><br/>
Music's changed my life in so many ways<br/>
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade<br/>
LL told me to rock the bells<br/>
NWA said fuck the police<br/>
Now I'm in jail<br/>
93 was strictly R&amp;B<br/>
Fucked up hair cut<br/>
Listen to Jodeci<br/>
Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike<br/>
Ass cheeks painted white<br/>
Fucking Presilla at night<br/>
Flying down sunset smoking crack<br/>
Transvestite in the front<br/>
Eddi Murphy in the back<br/>
MOP had me grindy and griddy<br/>
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue<br/>
And grew some titties<br/>
Ludacris told me to throw them bowls<br/>
Now I'm in the hospital<br/>
Broken nose and a fractured elbow<br/>
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock,<br/>
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops<br/>
<br/>
