Good mornin<br/>
Haha, wake your mother fuckin asses up<br/>
Yo what is the what?<br/>
Well come on then, you know what time it is<br/>
Stop sleepin on my roof bitch<br/>
<br/>
For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped<br/>
Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished<br/>
I just can't get past these little pissants<br/>
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad<br/>
And they so mad they can't stand it<br/>
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)<br/>
And they can't handle it like a man<br/>
And that's when it just happens<br/>
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?<br/>
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit<br/>
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion <br/>
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin <br/>
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now<br/>
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic<br/>
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it<br/>
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me<br/>
You poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit B<br/>
These words stick to you like crazy glue<br/>
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!<br/>
I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone<br/>
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)<br/>
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy &amp; Proof are you with me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
Come on an everybody come on an<br/>
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an<br/>
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an<br/>
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin<br/>
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin<br/>
So up an sing along with the words to the song an<br/>
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an<br/>
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in<br/>
Everybody come on an<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swifty]</i><br/>
?? the media pitted me of a beef starter<br/>
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one<br/>
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun<br/>
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run<br/>
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious<br/>
In a house full of dog shit, <br/>
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin <br/>
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin<br/>
It ain't about what you readin<br/>
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins<br/>
Either that or we'll be beefin free when <br/>
You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!<br/>
Your leader is a botique bitch<br/>
Keep the heater where you can reach quick<br/>
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret<br/>
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient<br/>
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan<br/>
You brave?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
Come on an everybody come on an<br/>
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an<br/>
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an<br/>
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin<br/>
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin<br/>
So up an sing along with the words to the song an<br/>
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an<br/>
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in<br/>
Everybody come on an<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kuniva]</i><br/>
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us<br/>
But so what this beef is like <br/>
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'<br/>
I can see that he's just a punk <br/>
I mean these niggas squeeze on me <br/>
Please I'm seeing guts<br/>
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks<br/>
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you <br/>
In front of every reporter that I don't like<br/>
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write<br/>
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!" <br/>
I might as well give this up like heavy sales<br/>
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt <br/>
We can't self destruct<br/>
I've never felt it this much<br/>
Come on fellas, get up<br/>
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kon Artis]</i><br/>
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip<br/>
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith<br/>
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick<br/>
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit<br/>
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's<br/>
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze<br/>
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's<br/>
But every time we hear you kick it <br/>
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets<br/>
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack<br/>
So when they bust you better bust back <br/>
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach<br/>
And when they want it (yeah)<br/>
I bring a hundred niggas from runave<br/>
So get your gun and if you comin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
Come on an everybody come on an<br/>
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an<br/>
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an<br/>
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin<br/>
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin<br/>
So up an sing along with the words to the song an<br/>
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an<br/>
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in<br/>
Everybody come on an
