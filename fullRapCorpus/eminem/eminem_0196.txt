You fucking groupie, pick up the goddamn phone.<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?<br/>
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'cha do screw Dre?<br/>
You went there looking for me? Boo that excuse is too lame<br/>
Keep playin' me, you gon' end up with a huge goose egg<br/>
You fake lyin' slut you never told me you knew Drake<br/>
And Lupe? you wanna lose two legs?<br/>
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say<br/>
OK, yeah and I'm coo-coo, ay?<br/>
Well screw you and I'll be the third person who screwed you today<br/>
Oh, fourth- Dre, Drake, Lupe oohm touche<br/>
Well you're too two-faced for me thought you was my number one true blue ace<br/>
But you ain't<br/>
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face<br/>
'Cause I'm hangin' up this phone, boo you make my fuckin' blue tooth ache<br/>
You feelin' blue, too late<br/>
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid<br/>
Here's what you say to someone you hate<br/>
<br/>
My life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead<br/>
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head<br/>
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much better<br/>
<br/>
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink<br/>
Hop on the freeway, tryin' to get some time alone and just think<br/>
Till the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause I told 'em I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink<br/>
I'm back on my fuck hoe's, with a whole new hatred for blondes<br/>
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby come on<br/>
Excuse the pun but bitch is such a 'broad' statement and I'm<br/>
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on<br/>
'Cause a woman broke my he-art I say he-art<br/>
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage<br/>
Who you think you a-are bitch?<br/>
Guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet<br/>
But I'll never say the L word again<br/>
I lo-lo-lo-lo lesbian<br/>
Aaahhh I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest<br/>
My life'd be so much better if you just<br/>
<br/>
My life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead<br/>
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head<br/>
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much better<br/>
<br/>
'Cause you told me you'd love me forever bitch that was a lie<br/>
Now I never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin' life<br/>
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea<br/>
<br/>
And I'm a have a whale of a time being a single sailor<br/>
For the night, bitch on a scale a<br/>
One to ten shit I must be the holy grail of<br/>
Catches hoe I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (dayla)<br/>
I might hit the club find a chick that's tailor<br/>
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back git hammered and nail her<br/>
These bitches tryin' get attached but there failin' to latch onto the tail of<br/>
My bumper they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer<br/>
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah I'm rich as a bitch<br/>
But bitches ain't shit I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch<br/>
Bitch you complain when you listen to this<br/>
But you still throw yourself at me that's what I call pitchin' a bitch<br/>
That's why I'm swingin' at these chicks on-site<br/>
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dicks on 'strike'<br/>
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch I'm a droid<br/>
I avoid Cupid stupid. Wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed<br/>
Oye, yoy-yoy<br/>
Man oh, man your boy-boy-boy's<br/>
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink oink oink<br/>
You fuckin' pigs all you're good for is doink doink doink<br/>
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one<br/>
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun<br/>
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest<br/>
Have a heart attack and just<br/>
Drop dead and I'm a throw a fuckin' party after this<br/>
'Cause, yes...<br/>
<br/>
My life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead<br/>
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head<br/>
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much better<br/>
<br/>
I'm just playin' bitch, you know I love you
