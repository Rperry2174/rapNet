<i>[Mr. Mackey]</i> <i>[Eric Cartman]</i><br/>
And everyone should get along..<br/>
Okay children quiet down, quiet down<br/>
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day<br/>
His name is Mr. Shady<br/>
Children quiet down please<br/>
Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!)<br/>
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute <br/>
while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (HE'S GOT AIDS!)<br/>
Good luck Mr. Shady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)<br/>
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels<br/>
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)<br/>
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom<br/>
and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot<br/>
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot<br/>
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot<br/>
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock<br/>
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog<br/>
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)<br/>
And even if they escaped and they got the cops<br/>
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge<br/>
'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job<br/>
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk<br/>
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off<br/>
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker<br/>
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka<br/>
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."<br/>
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her<br/>
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her<br/>
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander<br/>
they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner<br/>
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, <br/>
and what it might do to you<br/>
So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]</i><br/>
<br/>
See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)<br/>
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)<br/>
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)<br/>
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)<br/>
So kids say no to drugs (that's right)<br/>
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)<br/>
Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)<br/>
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? <br/>
FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)<br/>
Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?<br/>
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world<br/>
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it<br/>
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid<br/>
and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back<br/>
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back<br/>
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old <br/>
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold<br/>
and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys<br/>
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it<br/>
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive<br/>
and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*} <br/>
His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches<br/>
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*}<br/>
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him<br/>
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"<br/>
cause they took it too, so they think it's funny<br/>
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money<br/>
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over<br/>
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga<br/>
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac<br/>
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]</i><br/>
<br/>
See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)<br/>
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)<br/>
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)<br/>
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)<br/>
So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)<br/>
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)<br/>
And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)<br/>
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
And last but not least, one of the most humungous<br/>
problems among young people today, is fungus<br/>
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, <br/>
bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it<br/>
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff<br/>
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..<br/>
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)<br/>
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair<br/>
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire<br/>
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)<br/>
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms<br/>
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus<br/>
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)<br/>
cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!)<br/>
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact<br/>
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)<br/>
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.<br/>
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee<br/>
and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault<br/>
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, <br/>
cause I'm bad for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]</i><br/>
<br/>
See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)<br/>
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)<br/>
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)<br/>
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)<br/>
So kids say no to drugs (say no)<br/>
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)<br/>
And there's really nothin else to say (that's right)<br/>
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mr. Mackey]</i> <i>[Eric Cartman]</i><br/>
Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!)<br/>
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)<br/>
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)<br/>
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!)<br/>
so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)<br/>
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)<br/>
(So, fucked up, right now..)
