Aye yo Paul, It's Em<br/>
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing<br/>
And I know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video<br/>
What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?'<br/>
Well I'll show him who's really 'bad'<br/>
Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls<br/>
You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'<br/>
And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough'<br/>
Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?<br/>
Well he'll always be that Michael to me<br/>
And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'<br/>
Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons<br/>
And I hope they all fucking die!<br/>
How do you like that?<br/>
And I like him, I like him a lot<br/>
I want to touch him but I can't<br/>
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit<br/>
Sorry<br/>
Anyways, call me back<br/>
I have this idea about how I want to end the show<br/>
So, hit me when you get this message fucker<br/>
Oh, and by the way<br/>
No I don't have a new gun <i>[click]</i> (goddamn it)
