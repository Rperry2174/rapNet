<i>[Eminem Talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> <br/>
In my mind I'ma fighter, my heart's a lighter<br/>
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up<br/>
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis<br/>
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis<br/>
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed<br/>
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick<br/>
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics.<br/>
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick<br/>
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute<br/>
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly<br/>
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit<br/>
So stop dwelling an I am not felling<br/>
You fuckers are not ready, cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly<br/>
This is Destiny, yes money I'm of running<br/>
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2Pac]</i><br/>
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed<br/>
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed<br/>
my firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed<br/>
and fuck the world til I'm gone, Constantly armed<br/>
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed<br/>
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed<br/>
my firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed<br/>
and fuck the world til I'm gone Bitches be warned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem 2x]</i><br/>
I will not fall,<br/>
I will stand tall,<br/>
Feels like no one can beat me. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac]</i><br/>
Follow me tell me if you feel me <br/>
I think niggaz is tryin to kill me <br/>
Picturin pistols, spittin hollow points til they drill me <br/>
Keepin it real, and even if I do conceal <br/>
my criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin steel <br/>
See niggaz is false, sittin in court, turned snitches <br/>
that used to be real, but now they petrified bitches <br/>
I'm tryin to be strong, my firepower keep me warm<br/>
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til I'm gone, Bitches be warned.<br/>
word is bonb, you'll get torn<br/>
I'm bustin on Guiliani, he rubbin my niggaz wrong <br/>
And then it's on, before I leave picture me <br/>
I'm spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free <br/>
Watch me set it, niggaz don't want it, you can get it <br/>
Bet it make these jealous niggaz mad I said it <br/>
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes <br/>
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do', with fo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
