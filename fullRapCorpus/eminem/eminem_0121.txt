Yeah...<br/>
It's my life...<br/>
My own words I guess...<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?<br/>
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?<br/>
When they know they're your heart<br/>
And you know you were their armour<br/>
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her<br/>
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?<br/>
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?<br/>
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?<br/>
"Daddy, look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane<br/>
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"<br/>
I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy<br/>
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself<br/>
I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself<br/>
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her<br/>
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her<br/>
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy<br/>
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...<br/>
<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing,<br/>
So, baby, don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing,<br/>
So, baby, don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back...<br/>
<br/>
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing<br/>
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing<br/>
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"<br/>
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. "Daddy, you're lying.<br/>
You always say that, you always say this is the last time<br/>
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine."<br/>
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it<br/>
"Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy, no, stop it!"<br/>
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket<br/>
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you."<br/>
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror<br/>
These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em<br/>
They're saying, "You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.<br/>
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."<br/>
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door<br/>
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on<br/>
And I'm singing...<br/>
<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing,<br/>
So, baby, don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing,<br/>
So, baby, don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back...<br/>
<br/>
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat<br/>
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet<br/>
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out<br/>
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd<br/>
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing<br/>
"Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding."<br/>
But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?<br/>
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'.<br/>
"You lied to me, Dad, and now you make Mommy sad.<br/>
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.<br/>
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin.<br/>
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going."<br/>
But, baby, wait.<br/>
"It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.<br/>
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."<br/>
That's what they want, they want you Marshall<br/>
They keep screamin' your name<br/>
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill<br/>
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real<br/>
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see<br/>
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?<br/>
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it<br/>
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die Shady!" and pop it<br/>
The sky darkens, my life flashes,<br/>
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes<br/>
And burns to ashes<br/>
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'<br/>
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,<br/>
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her<br/>
Tell her I miss her,<br/>
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister<br/>
Almost as if to say<br/>
<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing,<br/>
So, baby, don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back<br/>
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn<br/>
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice<br/>
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling<br/>
And I didn't feel a thing,<br/>
So, baby, don't feel no pain<br/>
Just smile back...<br/>
<br/>
