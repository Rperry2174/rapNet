Yo... Same song and dance Damn girl, everywhere I go Same song and dance <br/>
I like the way you move! All over the globe Same song and dance Something about it man <br/>
Same song and dance In the Pale Moonlight Yo... <br/>
<br/>
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl Your kind of tookin' back by The whole rapper thing aren't ya? <br/>
Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?<br/>
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster <br/>
The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya <br/>
I think ya got your OnStar button inside your car stuck.<br/>
You outta gas, do you gotta flat? <br/>
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat I got your back <br/>
Why don't you put your laundry basket in the back<br/>
And sit up front, not askin' it's a trap <br/>
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap<br/>
In broad day, with no mask for this attack I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract<br/>
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back<br/>
C'mon <br/>
<br/>
Yeah baby, do that dance It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do <br/>
Girl shake that ass You ain't ever gonna break that glass<br/>
The windshields too strong for you I said yeah baby, sing that song<br/>
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing <br/>
You sexy little thing Show me what you got, give it your all<br/>
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?<br/>
Same song and dance... <br/>
<br/>
The first victim I had, she was a big one Big movie star, a party girl, big fun <br/>
She was the girl the media always picked on In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months <br/>
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts<br/>
And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once<br/>
What an event it was,<br/>
I was sitting in front I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns<br/>
Seen her back stage now here's where I come in son<br/>
Look here she comes I better pull out the big guns<br/>
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun <br/>
How bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt<br/>
Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want <br/>
Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun<br/>
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention<br/>
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension <br/>
You little Wench ya, murder wasn't my intention If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done<br/>
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her With sixty-six inches of extension... cord. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah baby, do that dance It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do <br/>
Girl shake that ass You ain't ever gonna break that glass<br/>
The windshields too strong for you I said yeah baby, sing that song<br/>
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing <br/>
You sexy little thing Show me what you got, give it your all<br/>
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance... <br/>
<br/>
My second victim was even bigger then the first<br/>
Pop star, icon, the whole works <br/>
She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst<br/>
Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers<br/>
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts<br/>
It irked me and made me mad at first I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on <br/>
Was that I had developed a crush I just didn't know how to tell it to her... <br/>
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?<br/>
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk? <br/>
We'll settle this once and for all, I'mma tell her at dusk Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must <br/>
Creep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love,<br/>
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up!<br/>
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?<br/>
I'll share my valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney! <br/>
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent <br/>
I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you<br/>
Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value<br/>
Come-on toots, give me the valium alleyoop... <br/>
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke<br/>
And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you<br/>
New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you <br/>
Shoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do <br/>
<br/>
Yeah baby, do that dance<br/>
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do <br/>
Girl shake that ass<br/>
You ain't ever gonna break that glass<br/>
The windshields too strong for you I said yeah baby, sing that song<br/>
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing <br/>
You sexy little thing<br/>
Show me what you got, give it your all<br/>
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?<br/>
Same song and dance... <br/>
<br/>
Same kickin' and screamin' same cryin' and sobbin' Same song and dance... <br/>
Same diggin' and pleadin' same yellin' and bleedin' Same song and dance <br/>
Yeah Same song and dance  know Same song and dance
