Where's my snare?<br/>
I have no snare in my headphones - there you go<br/>
Yeah... yo, yo<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?<br/>
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against<br/>
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times<br/>
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind<br/>
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding<br/>
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going<br/>
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing<br/>
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening<br/>
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth<br/>
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out<br/>
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you mama?<br/>
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)<br/>
I said I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet<br/>
<br/>
Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet<br/>
And I don't know if no one knows it<br/>
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it<br/>
I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73<br/>
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD<br/>
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months<br/>
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch<br/>
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye<br/>
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die<br/>
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side<br/>
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try<br/>
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake<br/>
I maybe made some mistakes<br/>
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today<br/>
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb<br/>
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun<br/>
'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both<br/>
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)<br/>
I said I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet<br/>
<br/>
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition<br/>
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing<br/>
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision<br/>
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen<br/>
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing<br/>
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome<br/>
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't<br/>
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach<br/>
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?<br/>
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?<br/>
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely<br/>
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony<br/>
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful<br/>
But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral!<br/>
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong<br/>
Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom!<br/>
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get<br/>
You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit<br/>
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?<br/>
Well guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)<br/>
I said I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)<br/>
I said I'm sorry mama!<br/>
I never meant to hurt you!<br/>
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight<br/>
I'm cleaning out my closet
