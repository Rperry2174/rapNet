<i>[Spoken introduction:]</i><br/>
D.M.C. we have a mid 30s male<br/>
Found down unresponsive<br/>
Possible over dose<br/>
Substance unknown<br/>
Pulse is 60 and thready<br/>
Respiration's 8 he's intubated<br/>
And we're bagging him now<br/>
Uuh B.P. 90 over palp<br/>
Patient cool pale and diaphoretic<br/>
Has aspirated<br/>
Uuh G.S.C. is 3<br/>
We'll update en route<br/>
E.T.A. 10 minutes<br/>
<br/>
As I fall deeper into a manic state<br/>
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait<br/>
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate<br/>
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate<br/>
Start off with the NyQuil like I think I'll just have a taste<br/>
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate<br/>
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great<br/>
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight<br/>
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate<br/>
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak<br/>
And you'd think with all I have at stake<br/>
Look at my daughter's face... "Mommy, something is wrong with dad, I think.<br/>
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me.<br/>
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me.<br/>
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos.<br/>
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat."<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel so alone,<br/>
I just don't know,<br/>
Feels like I been down this road before.<br/>
So lonely and cold.<br/>
It's like something takes over me,<br/>
Soon as I go home and close the door.<br/>
Kinda feels like déjà vu.<br/>
I wanna get away from this place I do.<br/>
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't<br/>
And why? I just don't know...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer<br/>
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year<br/>
And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fucking hear<br/>
Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers.<br/>
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed for half of the time<br/>
Who's that mastermind behind that little line?<br/>
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind<br/>
To have another half of glass of wine sound asinine<br/>
Ya I know<br/>
But I never had no problem with alcohol<br/>
Ouch, look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall<br/>
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball<br/>
Shit must have knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all<br/>
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?<br/>
Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache<br/>
Shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?<br/>
"All systems ready for take off, please, stand by"<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel so alone,<br/>
I just don't know,<br/>
Feels like I been down this road before,<br/>
So lonely and cold,<br/>
It's like something takes over me,<br/>
Soon as I go home and close the door,<br/>
Kinda feels like déjà vu.<br/>
I wanna get away from this place I do.<br/>
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't<br/>
And why? I just don't know...<br/>
<br/>
So I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah<br/>
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high<br/>
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by<br/>
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die<br/>
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use<br/>
There's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through<br/>
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze<br/>
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?<br/>
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse<br/>
Just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax<br/>
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps<br/>
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see<br/>
That's an Ambien each nap how many Valium? Three.<br/>
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep<br/>
OK, so now you see the reason how come he<br/>
Has taken four years just to put out an album beat<br/>
See me and you we almost had the same outcome heath<br/>
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing<br/>
It was Bologna was it the methadone ya think<br/>
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos<br/>
Your VCR tape cases with you Ambient CR great places to hide ain't it<br/>
So you can lie to Hallie<br/>
I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina<br/>
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance<br/>
They said they found me on the bathroom floor... Damn<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel so alone,<br/>
I just don't know,<br/>
Feels like I been down this road before,<br/>
So lonely and cold,<br/>
It's like something takes over me,<br/>
Soon as I go home and close the door.<br/>
Kinda feels like déjà vu.<br/>
I wanna get away from this place I do.<br/>
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't.<br/>
And why? I just don't know...
