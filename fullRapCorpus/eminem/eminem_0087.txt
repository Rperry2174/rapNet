Step by step, heart to heart, left right left<br/>
We all fall down...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left<br/>
We all fall down like toy soldiers<br/>
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win<br/>
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure<br/>
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders<br/>
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it<br/>
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter<br/>
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to<br/>
I'm supposed to set an example<br/>
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em<br/>
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em<br/>
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it<br/>
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it<br/>
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it<br/>
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit<br/>
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it<br/>
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted<br/>
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it<br/>
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it<br/>
That was never my object for someone to get killed<br/>
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build<br/>
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good<br/>
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'<br/>
And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth<br/>
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about<br/>
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef<br/>
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth<br/>
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life<br/>
Like fuck it i understand this is business<br/>
And this shit just isn't none of my business<br/>
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme<br/>
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'<br/>
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it<br/>
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?<br/>
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'<br/>
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'<br/>
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him<br/>
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him<br/>
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him<br/>
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it<br/>
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions<br/>
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk<br/>
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection<br/>
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record<br/>
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up<br/>
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous<br/>
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'<br/>
Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then<br/>
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think<br/>
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.<br/>
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind<br/>
We still have soldiers that's on the front line<br/>
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders<br/>
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us<br/>
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus<br/>
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is<br/>
To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners<br/>
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is<br/>
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered<br/>
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it<br/>
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict<br/>
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further<br/>
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'<br/>
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man<br/>
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can<br/>
Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'<br/>
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
