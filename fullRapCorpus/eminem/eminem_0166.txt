<i>[Chorus - Pink:]</i><br/>
You can sound the alarm<br/>
you can call out your guards<br/>
you can fence in your yard<br/>
you can hold all the cards<br/>
but I won't back down<br/>
oh no I wont back down<br/>
oh no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe Devilles<br/>
brain dead rims yeah stupid wheels<br/>
girl I'm too for real<br/>
lose your tooth and nails<br/>
try to fight it, try to deny it<br/>
stupid you will feel<br/>
what I do, I do it well<br/>
shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill<br/>
half a breath left on my death bed<br/>
screaming, "F that!" yeah super ill<br/>
baby what the deal<br/>
we can chill, split half a pill and a happy meal<br/>
fuck a steak slut<br/>
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill<br/>
listen garden tool don't make me introduce you to my power tool<br/>
you know the fucking drill<br/>
how you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?<br/>
summer's eve Massengill<br/>
shady's got the mass appeal baby crank the shit<br/>
cause it's your Goddamn jam<br/>
you say that you want your punchlines a little more compact<br/>
well shawty I'm that man<br/>
these other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man<br/>
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said<br/>
settle ya fucking ass down I'm ready for combat, man<br/>
get it calm Batman?<br/>
nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts<br/>
lines are like mom's cat scans<br/>
cause they fucking go bananas<br/>
honey I applaud that ass<br/>
swear to God, man, these broads can't dance<br/>
ma, show ‘em how it's done<br/>
spazz like a God Damn Tas, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Pink]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Girl, shake that ass like a Donkey with Parkinson's<br/>
Make like Michael J Fox in the drawers playin' with a etch-a-sketch<br/>
bet you that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door<br/>
people hit the floors<br/>
yeah tonight ladies you gon get divorced<br/>
girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with<br/>
Chris's force like you pissed him off<br/>
talented with the tongue motherfucker<br/>
you ain't gotta lick in yours<br/>
hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores<br/>
makin' cash registers shit their draws<br/>
think you spit the rawest<br/>
I'm an uncooked slab of beef<br/>
laying on your kitchen floor<br/>
in other words I'm off the meat rack<br/>
bring the beat back<br/>
bring me two extension chords<br/>
I'mma measure my dick shit I need 6 inches more<br/>
fuck my dicks big bitch<br/>
need I remind you that I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig?<br/>
you're addicted I'm dope<br/>
I'm the longest needle around here<br/>
need a fix up I'm the big shot<br/>
get it dicks snots<br/>
you're just small boats little pricks<br/>
girl you think that other prick's hot<br/>
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match<br/>
‘fore I sit back and let ‘em get hot<br/>
better call the cops on ‘em quick fast<br/>
shady's right back on your bitch ass<br/>
white trash with a half a six pack in his hatchback<br/>
trailer hitch attached to the back (dispatch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Pink]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping?<br/>
does a bird chirp? Lil' Wayne slurps syrup til he burps<br/>
and smokes purp<br/>
does a word search gets circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through?<br/>
I'd like you to remind yourself<br/>
of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic<br/>
or you're the kind of girl that I can take a liking to<br/>
psych I'm spiking you like a football<br/>
been this way since I've stood a foot tall<br/>
you're a good catch with a shitty spouse<br/>
got a pretty mouth and a good jaw<br/>
gimme good brain<br/>
watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain<br/>
bitch, you listening? Tryna' turn me down<br/>
slut, I'm talking to you, turn me back up<br/>
are you insane tryna talk over me in the car<br/>
shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'<br/>
I'ma shit stain on the underwear of life<br/>
what's the saying? where there's thunder there's lightning<br/>
and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place<br/>
then how the fuck have I been hit six times<br/>
in three different locations<br/>
on four separate occasions?<br/>
and you can bet your stinking ass<br/>
that I've come to smash everything in my path<br/>
fork was in the road took the psychopath<br/>
poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash<br/>
so hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone<br/>
shake your booty shawty I'm the shit<br/>
why you think Proof used to call me Doody?<br/>
<br/>
