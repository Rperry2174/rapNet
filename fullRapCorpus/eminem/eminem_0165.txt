Yeah.. Ya Know?.. Critics Man<br/>
Critics Never Got Nothin Nice To Say man<br/>
You know the one thing I notice about critics man?<br/>
Is.. critics never ask me how my day went<br/>
Well imma tell em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow<br/>
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow<br/>
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo<br/>
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole<br/>
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro<br/>
Better hold on a little tighter here I go<br/>
Flows tighter, hot headed as ghostrider<br/>
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin a spider in the snow<br/>
So ya better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole<br/>
Why am I like this? why is winter cold<br/>
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes<br/>
Listen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets<br/>
This isnt golf this is a blisterin' assault<br/>
Those are your wounds this is the salt<br/>
So get lost<br/>
Shit dissin me is just like pissin off the wizard of oz<br/>
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it<br/>
Grab the scissors and saws and<br/>
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls<br/>
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws<br/>
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw<br/>
Then discribe how it tasted like dessert to us all<br/>
Got the gall to make chris piss in his draws<br/>
Ticklin him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You on fire<br/>
Thats how ya know your on a roll<br/>
Cause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold<br/>
Your on fire<br/>
Man I'm so fuckin sick I got ambulances pullin me over and shit<br/>
Your on fire<br/>
Ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop the blow<br/>
Your on fire.. your on fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses if you mistook the for a song, look<br/>
This aint a song its a warnin to brooke, hogan and david cook<br/>
That the crook just took over so book<br/>
Run as fast as you can, stop writin and kill it<br/>
Im lightning in a skillet your a fuckin flash in a pan<br/>
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin a fan<br/>
Mr mathers is the man<br/>
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can<br/>
Come back and whip your ass with it again<br/>
Salivas like sufiric acid in your hand itll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man<br/>
Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine<br/>
Yeah ask the nine man<br/>
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon<br/>
Fuck it I aint playin<br/>
Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin<br/>
Vietnam vet.. I'm out my fuckin mind man<br/>
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand<br/>
So if I seem a little mean to you this aint savage you aint never seen a brute<br/>
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route<br/>
You couldnt make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut poop<br/>
Sayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care<br/>
Then why the fuck am I yellin at air<br/>
I aint even talkin to noone cause aint nobody there<br/>
Nobody will fuckin test me cause these hos wont even dare<br/>
Im wastin punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here<br/>
Naw dont waste it save it psycho yeah<br/>
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about michaels hair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You're on fire<br/>
Thats how ya know your on a roll<br/>
Cause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold<br/>
Your on fire<br/>
Man I'm so hot my motherfuckin firetrucks on fire homie<br/>
Your on fire<br/>
Ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to give the whole hip hop shop the blow<br/>
Your on fire.. your on fire<br/>
Your on fire
