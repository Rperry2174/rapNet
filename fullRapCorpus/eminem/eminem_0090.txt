Ohh!<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
So much for first single on this one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Shady's the label<br/>
Aftermath is the stable<br/>
That the horses come out erra<br/>
Of course we're about to stir up<br/>
Some shit thick as Mrs Buttersworth's syrup<br/>
It's the Mr. picked on Christopher Reeves<br/>
Just for no reason other than the just to tease him<br/>
Cause he was was his biggest fan, he used to be Superman<br/>
Now we're pouring liquor on the curb in his name for him<br/>
Eminem you wait till' we meet up again<br/>
Fucker I'm kicking your ass for everything you've ever said<br/>
It's one for the money two for the fucking show<br/>
Ready get set, let's go<br/>
Here comes the bucking bronco stomping and stampeding up the damn street<br/>
Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm bout' to blow<br/>
So look out below, Geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos<br/>
I'm on a roll, around and around I go<br/>
When will I stop? I don't know<br/>
Tryna pick up where the Eminem Show left off<br/>
But I know anything's possible<br/>
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold<br/>
I'm at the top of my game<br/>
That shit is not gonna change<br/>
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team<br/>
I'll get away with murder<br/>
I'm like O.J. he's like my Cochran today<br/>
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes<br/>
In a safe, locked them away<br/>
Better watch what you say<br/>
Just when you thought you were safe<br/>
Them fuckers got you on tape<br/>
You swear to god you was playing<br/>
Whether or not you was little Joshua<br/>
Gosh I wish I could've told you to not do the same<br/>
Cause one day it could cost you your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And this was supposed to be my first single<br/>
But I just fucked that up so,<br/>
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle<br/>
Slap a bitch and smack a ho<br/>
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle<br/>
That you hear on your radio<br/>
But shit's about to hit the shingle<br/>
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No<br/>
erra Oh Ah<br/>
erra Oh Ah<br/>
erra Oh Ah<br/>
erra Oh Oh Ah Ah<br/>
Oh Ah Oh Ah<br/>
Oh Ah Oh Ah<br/>
Poo Poo Ca Ca<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Erra Erra Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills<br/>
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derick bare naked<br/>
chicka chicka chicka ..<br/>
Janean just turned 16 and used a fake id<br/>
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly<br/>
Hehehehehe, to be so young and naive<br/>
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free<br/>
Paris and Nikki's parents must be so tickled to cherish<br/>
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks<br/>
Hickory Dickory Dirk Diggler<br/>
Look at me work wizardry with these words<br/>
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken<br/>
Or Chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain<br/>
22 jerks and a jerk circle<br/>
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute<br/>
What am I saying, allow me to run it back and rewind it<br/>
rrrbb lemme ask you again<br/>
Am I just jerkin the chain<br/>
Am I bizerk or insane<br/>
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs<br/>
Working the damn camera filming one of them<br/>
Paris Hilton home made pornos<br/>
Who keeps tilting the lens at an angle<br/>
Chicka Chicka<br/>
Just recently somebody just discovered<br/>
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fucking<br/>
When they were just musketeers in the Mickey Mouse club<br/>
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them<br/>
Cause they could've sworn someone said Nuh-<br/>
And then tried to erase and record over it<br/>
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the<br/>
Ga-Uh and then the come to find out it was Justin<br/>
Saying "I'm gonna come!"<br/>
And this was suppose to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
supposed to be my first single<br/>
But I just fucked that up so,<br/>
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle<br/>
Slap a bitch and smack a ho<br/>
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle<br/>
That you hear on your radio<br/>
But shit's about to hit the shingle<br/>
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No<br/>
erra Oh Ah<br/>
erra Oh Ah<br/>
erra Oh Ah<br/>
erra Oh Oh Ah Ah<br/>
Oh Ah Oh Ah<br/>
Oh Ah Oh Ah<br/>
Poo Poo Ca Ca<br/>

<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest<br/>
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it<br/>
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number<br/>
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick<br/>
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me<br/>
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key<br/>
And I'll be sure to get back<br/>
As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre<br/>
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)<br/>
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken,<br/>
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock(?) bawka-bi-kaw<br/>
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick<br/>
And stick a dick in your mouth<br/>
I'm done you can fuck off<br/>
fucka-fucka-fuck off!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And this was supposed to be my first single<br/>
But I just fucked that up so,<br/>
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle<br/>
Slap a bitch and smack a ho<br/>
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle<br/>
That you hear on your radio<br/>
But shit's about to hit the shingle<br/>
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No<br/>
