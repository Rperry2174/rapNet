Obie, yo', i'm sick, damn, you straight dog...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's why I ain't got no time, for these games and stupid tricks, or these bitches on my dick,<br/>
that's how dudes be getting sick, that's how dicks be getting drips, falling victims to this<br/>
shit, from these bitches on our dicks, fucking chickens with no ribs, that's why I ain't got no<br/>
time...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice]</i><br/>
Yo', I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk, I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights<br/>
tunk, pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you should of<br/>
seen this, big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french roll stylin', body like a stallion, sizin'<br/>
up the figure while my shit getting bigger, debatin' on a fuck or do I want to be her nigga,<br/>
caressin' this bitch, plus i'm checking out them tit's, sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used<br/>
to buyin', I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but that's<br/>
another story, for surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like bishop in<br/>
juice, the womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock in that spot hotter than the<br/>
hottest block, don't stop, the response I got when I was knockin' it, clock steady tickin',<br/>
kinky finger lickin', and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans, I gotta slow down before I<br/>
cum soon, and work that nigga, like a slave owner, when I dropped off my outfit, she knew I<br/>
wanted to bone her, she foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' like<br/>
some sour cream dip, without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, pussy tighter than<br/>
conditions of us black folks, we in the final stretch, the last part of sex, I bust a fat ass<br/>
nut, then I woke up next, like what the fuck is goin' on here, this bitch evaporated, pussy and<br/>
all, just picked up and vacated, now i'm frusturated cause my dick was unprotected, and Doctor<br/>
Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin', someone better get this bitch,<br/>
before she get's kicked in the stomach, and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me<br/>
to throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to<br/>
any violence of any sort, but what's she shovin' me for, doesn't she love me no more, wasn't she<br/>
huggin' me four minutes ago at the door, man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this<br/>
whore, what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce, she's havin' another baby<br/>
in a month, and it's yours, and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin' someone<br/>
else, and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back, to Michigan, now the<br/>
plot is thickenin' worse, cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a<br/>
hearse, so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever since they told you this shit,<br/>
you've been holdin' your dick, so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it, then<br/>
the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace, and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby<br/>
it's AIDS, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it, so you jet back home, cause you<br/>
gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo', cause you love<br/>
her, you never would expect that blow, Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low,<br/>
Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners, bringin' me home diseases, swingin'<br/>
from Obie's penis, she's so deceivin', shit this hoe's a genius, she g'd us...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches, fuck 'em all, get money, Shady records, Obie Trice, Eminem,<br/>
motherfucker, new millenium shit, yeah, turn this shit off, turn this shit the fuck off...
