<i>[Intro - talking]</i><br/>
Shady, Aftermath<br/>
BTOV<br/>
<br/>
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor<br/>
Bumpin and grindin that pole<br/>
The way she's grindin that pole<br/>
I think I'm losing control<br/>
Bobby Creek<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bobby Creek]</i><br/>
I'm on the patron<br/>
In the end I'm gone<br/>
My eyes ain't clear<br/>
I'm gone<br/>
So she hear me wrong<br/>
I'm kinda in the zone<br/>
Cause the DJ playin' my song<br/>
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known<br/>
I'm from Atlanta<br/>
So southern ain't just part of my grammar<br/>
I can up and cock the hammer<br/>
For any nigga<br/>
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana<br/>
Get loose put some more of my juice<br/>
In your caboose<br/>
Sippin everything from white grain<br/>
To deuce juice<br/>
With nothin' to gain<br/>
But my grace and loose tooths<br/>
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too<br/>
Bobby creek is in the place<br/>
The name is snoop too<br/>
My drinks is 10 around<br/>
I can make her spin around<br/>
If she keep her dinner down<br/>
Simmer down<br/>
We can hit the telly when the fun stops<br/>
And I hit you in ya ?<br/>
Come sip on my gumdrops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I met a bad bitch last night in the D<br/>
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me<br/>
Conversation and Hennessey<br/>
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top<br/>
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop<br/>
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock<br/>
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock<br/>
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet<br/>
It's real easy just follow the beat<br/>
Don't let that fine girl pass you by<br/>
Look real close cause strobe lights lie<br/>
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)<br/>
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)<br/>
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut<br/>
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up<br/>
Some girls they act retarded<br/>
Some girls are bout it bout it<br/>
I'm lookin for a girl<br/>
That will do whatever the fuck<br/>
I say everyday she be givin it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg - Chorus]</i><br/>
Shake that ass for me,<br/>
Shake that ass for me<br/>
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,<br/>
Shake that ass for me<br/>
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,<br/>
Shake that ass for me<br/>
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,<br/>
Shake that ass for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Obie Trice!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice]</i><br/>
One slug<br/>
Couldn't snuff young cuz<br/>
Goodness gracious<br/>
Haters stay on these nuts<br/>
Just like a hood rat chick who was curious<br/>
Serious<br/>
Full breast, ready to touch<br/>
Who's that in the cool blue back<br/>
With a new rag<br/>
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch<br/>
True I had a few<br/>
Obie rollin' with brews<br/>
Annually knockin' the boots<br/>
It's on manual<br/>
The way I knock em outta they shoes<br/>
Talk a little shit<br/>
Then they anus'll ooze<br/>
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang<br/>
Who<br/>
It's shady<br/>
You know the name of the crew<br/>
You know the aim is to bang you<br/>
In the mansion<br/>
With a magnum<br/>
With a night pass to the matinee<br/>
Obie<br/>
Came to party<br/>
You better ask somebody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg - Chorus]</i><br/>
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me<br/>
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,<br/>
Shake that ass for me<br/>
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,<br/>
Shake that ass for me<br/>
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,<br/>
Shake that ass for me
