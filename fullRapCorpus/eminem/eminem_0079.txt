<i>[in a high falsetto voice]</i><br/>
Uncle Marshall!<br/>
Will you tell us a bedtime story?<br/>
<i>[regular voice]</i><br/>
Here we go...<br/>
<br/>
Now once upon a time not long ago<br/>
There was a little rapper about to blow<br/>
But his album came and it was not good<br/>
I think it went lead or double copper wood<br/>
So the silly little fans they were mislead<br/>
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head<br/>
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash<br/>
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"<br/>
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to<br/>
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer<br/>
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister<br/>
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister<br/>
And in this corner, we have the mister<br/>
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister<br/>
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for<br/>
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'<br/>
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor<br/>
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta<br/>
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya<br/>
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch<br/>
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?<br/>
Please tell me what happened with<br/>
That style that you were rappin' with<br/>
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch<br/>
Are you from Los Angeles<br/>
New York or just a janitor<br/>
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch<br/>
<br/>
Now at first I ain't really understand the shit<br/>
Picture me for a second and imagine it<br/>
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'<br/>
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners<br/>
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit<br/>
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick<br/>
For me, being just a sick, this conflict<br/>
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic<br/>
And I know how you jealous ones envy<br/>
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me<br/>
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit<br/>
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC<br/>
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return<br/>
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me <br/>
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" <br/>
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me <br/>
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building <br/>
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! <br/>
So I went back and read the first few letters that said <br/>
Some shit about a message you left <br/>
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" <br/>
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! <br/>
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre <br/>
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch<br/>
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?<br/>
Please tell me what happened with<br/>
That style that you were rappin' with<br/>
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch<br/>
Are you from Los Angeles<br/>
New York or just a janitor<br/>
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch <br/>
<br/>
So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib <br/>
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives <br/>
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship <br/>
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it <br/>
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost <br/>
We can fly over the border "Let's go" <i>[WOOSH!]</i><br/>
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed <br/>
<i>[BOOSH!]</i> (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri <br/>
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste <br/>
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case <br/>
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car <br/>
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles <br/>
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate <br/>
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate <br/>
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' <br/>
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way <br/>
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous <br/>
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" <br/>
Plus he raps with his regular voice <i>[BOOSH! BOOSH!]</i><br/>
<i>[BOOSH! BOOSH!]</i> (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys <br/>
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted <br/>
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted <br/>
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love <br/>
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done <br/>
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ <br/>
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife <br/>
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more <br/>
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw <br/>
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! <br/>
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! <br/>
Do somethin'! At least one punchline <br/>
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-<br/>
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde <br/>
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! <br/>
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars <br/>
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! <br/>
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs <br/>
Bite another line from Redman's song! <br/>
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm <br/>
From a midget reaches out from under the car <br/>
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither <br/>
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether <br/>
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again <br/>
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! <br/>
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) <br/>
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! <br/>
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)<br/>
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch<br/>
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?<br/>
Please tell me what happened with<br/>
That style that you were rappin' with<br/>
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch<br/>
Are you from Los Angeles<br/>
New York or just a janitor<br/>
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch
