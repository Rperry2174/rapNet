<i>[sounds like a TV soap opera]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roger]</i> Skylar Montgomery?<br/>
<i>[Skylar]</i> What do you want from me Roger?<br/>
<i>[Roger]</i> I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica!<br/>
<i>[Skylar]</i> Wait a minute, you hold it right there. <br/>
Me and that woman love each other<br/>
<i>[Roger]</i> Love!? <br/>
What do you know of love?<br/>
<i>[Skylar]</i> We were destined to be together<br/>
I met her on the beach!<br/>
<i>[Roger]</i> Are you out to destroy me?<br/>
<i>[Skylar]</i> No Roger. That's not what I want to do<br/>
I love her! And were going to be together<br/>
<i>[Roger]</i> Never!
