<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
There's not much you could do or say to phase me<br/>
People think I'm a little bit crazy<br/>
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll<br/>
Have to step in every once in a while to save me<br/>
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things<br/>
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think<br/>
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me<br/>
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me<br/>
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy<br/>
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times<br/>
cuz I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing<br/>
And I could give a fuck what category you place me<br/>
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone<br/>
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats<br/>
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z<br/>
For every single die hard fan who embraced me<br/>
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me<br/>
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me<br/>
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me<br/>
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me<br/>
It only made me what I am today, see<br/>
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me<br/>
You ain't gonna make or break me<br/>
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G<br/>
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening<br/>
Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me<br/>
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me<br/>
You had all this time to think about it<br/>
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me<br/>
Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day<br/>
That we finally meet in the same place to see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2 - Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
No matter how many battles I been in and won<br/>
No matter how many magazines on my nuts<br/>
No matter how many MC's I eat up<br/>
Ooh ooh, it's never enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent]</i><br/>
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it<br/>
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics<br/>
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split<br/>
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it<br/>
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit<br/>
Graze it, your peace talk, save it<br/>
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated<br/>
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers<br/>
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse<br/>
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?<br/>
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it<br/>
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic<br/>
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it<br/>
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag or chop it<br/>
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it<br/>
When it's hot, it's hot<br/>
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
