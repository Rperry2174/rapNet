Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself<br/>
My name is Shady<br/>
So nice to meet you<br/>
It's been a long time sorry I've been away so long<br/>
My name is Shady<br/>
I never meant to leave you<br/>
<br/>
You see that chick in the gym checking me out?<br/>
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth<br/>
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house<br/>
That was suppose to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?<br/>
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse<br/>
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out<br/>
Nope, guess I'll re-route<br/>
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch<br/>
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth<br/>
Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it<br/>
A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn wratchet (A tac-tac-tacin a whore) with a damn hatchet<br/>
A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs<br/>
Shorty come back, I'm trying to score me some lapdances I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels<br/>
Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules<br/>
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello<br/>
And are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say Hello<br/>
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shaking like Jello<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello<br/>
<br/>
My equilibrium is off, must me the Lithium I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em It just becomes everyday extracurriculum No reason in particular, it was strictly fun<br/>
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151 51 people asleep in my damn living room<br/>
Scuse me hun? But what is your name, (Vivian?) (I woke up) next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?<br/>
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun? I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one<br/>
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm<br/>
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from (I find the package) and I'm cool,<br/>
I immediately run like Speedy Gon- Zalez to see if I see anyone<br/>
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some My head is pounding to the beat of the drum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello<br/>
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?<br/>
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello<br/>
<br/>
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were<br/>
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good<br/>
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)<br/>
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged<br/>
(He's no longer getting) the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-adins<br/>
Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in<br/>
Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurting him'<br/>
Tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up muscle relaxants for his back and a couple of packs<br/>
Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumbling back<br/>
Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack<br/>
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap<br/>
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap<br/>
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back<br/>
And so I'm saying...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello<br/>
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow,<br/>
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello<br/>
<br/>
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself My name is Shady<br/>
So nice to meet you It's been a long time sorry I've been away so long<br/>
My name is Shady I never meant to leave you
