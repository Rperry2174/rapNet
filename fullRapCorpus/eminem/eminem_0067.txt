<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
These ideas are nightmares to white parents<br/>
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings<br/>
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing<br/>
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring<br/>
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care<br/>
He's a problem child<br/>
What bothers him all comes out, when he talks about<br/>
His fuckin' dad walkin' out<br/>
'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out<br/>
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out<br/>
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back<br/>
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap<br/>
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap<br/>
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose<br/>
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(C'mon), sing with me, (sing), sing for the years<br/>
(Sing it), sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (c'mon)<br/>
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters<br/>
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum<br/>
Holy or unholy, only have one homie<br/>
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me<br/>
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great<br/>
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate<br/>
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make<br/>
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum<br/>
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen<br/>
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'<br/>
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass<br/>
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you<br/>
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you<br/>
To get their hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind every time you mad<br/>
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon<br/>
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns<br/>
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly<br/>
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me<br/>
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me<br/>
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete<br/>
It's all political, if my music is literal, and I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl<br/>
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
They say music can alter moods and talk to you<br/>
Well can it load a gun up for you , and cock it too<br/>
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude<br/>
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued<br/>
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols<br/>
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool<br/>
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers<br/>
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus<br/>
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our cheques in the mail<br/>
It's fucked up ain't it<br/>
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted<br/>
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing<br/>
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine<br/>
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long<br/>
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs<br/>
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives<br/>
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die<br/>
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe<br/>
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes<br/>
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it<br/>
'Cause we consider these minutes golden<br/>
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone<br/>
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
