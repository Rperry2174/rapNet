<i>[Police voice:]</i><br/>
Attention all units, attention all units<br/>
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair<br/>
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair<br/>
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife<br/>
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's<br/>
He could be coming at your girlfriend next<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward<br/>
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward<br/>
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm<br/>
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm<br/>
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair<br/>
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there<br/>
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes<br/>
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Stay away from him he ain't no good!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed<br/>
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms<br/>
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors<br/>
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors<br/>
Protectors and be sure that you stand close<br/>
Watch each others backs and guard your command post<br/>
And most of all be advised that he's wise<br/>
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Stay away from him he ain't no good!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally<br/>
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully<br/>
For what he first did to me<br/>
It's sure to be the last<br/>
Following footprints with a magnifying glass<br/>
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell<br/>
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail<br/>
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar<br/>
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Stay away from him he ain't no good!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps<br/>
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs<br/>
Inside the depths of his basement<br/>
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!<br/>
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes<br/>
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs<br/>
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed<br/>
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Stay away from him he ain't no good!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5:]</i><br/>
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned<br/>
They're only powerful when you got your back turned<br/>
I yearned for the day that we finally met again<br/>
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine<br/>
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean<br/>
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen<br/>
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home<br/>
Beating him over the head with the telephone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Police voice:]</i><br/>
Attention all cars, attention all cars<br/>
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect<br/>
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat<br/>
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Stay away from him he ain't no good!<br/>
I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Stay away from him he ain't no good!<br/>
I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber<br/>
Why I oughtta<br/>
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
