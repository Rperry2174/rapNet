You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you<br/>
And I believe<br/>
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe<br/>
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please<br/>
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees<br/>
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"<br/>
Snatch the keys from your hand<br/>
I would squeeze and you'd laugh<br/>
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me<br/>
And you must hate me<br/>
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?<br/>
And you've had enough of me<br/>
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge<br/>
<br/>
But you won't break me<br/>
You'll just make me stronger than I was<br/>
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you<br/>
And if I stumble, I won't crumble<br/>
I'll get back up and uhhh<br/>
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"<br/>
'Cause I'm stronger than I was<br/>
<br/>
A beautiful face is all that you have<br/>
'Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad<br/>
But you're all that I love<br/>
I grasp, you can't leave<br/>
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please<br/>
<br/>
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees<br/>
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"<br/>
But you left and you took everything I had left<br/>
And left nothing, nothing for me<br/>
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby<br/>
We're still together in my head<br/>
And you're still in love with me<br/>
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead<br/>
<br/>
But you won't break me<br/>
You'll just make me stronger than I was<br/>
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you<br/>
And if I stumble, I won't crumble<br/>
I'll get back up and uhhh<br/>
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"<br/>
'Cause I'm stronger than I was<br/>
<br/>
You walked out, I almost died<br/>
It was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause I was so traumatized<br/>
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride<br/>
I'd rather die than you not by my side<br/>
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried<br/>
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide,<br/>
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde<br/>
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I<br/>
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie<br/>
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?<br/>
'Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda<br/>
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the<br/>
Other side of my back and stuck a spike, too, should've<br/>
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time<br/>
No one could hurt me like you could've<br/>
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?<br/>
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer<br/>
'Cause this morning I finally stood up<br/>
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the<br/>
First time since you left and left me with nothing but shattered dreams<br/>
And the life we could've had and we could've been<br/>
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in<br/>
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again<br/>
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit<br/>
I'mma be late for the pity party<br/>
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again<br/>
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chump-ions<br/>
I'm done being your punching bag<br/>
<br/>
It was November 31st today, would've been our anniversary<br/>
Two years, but you left on the first of May<br/>
I wrote it on a calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say<br/>
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay<br/>
And I thank you (uh) 'cause you made me (uh) a better person than I was<br/>
But I hate you (uh) 'cause you drained me (uh)<br/>
I gave you all, you gave me none<br/>
But if you blame me (uh), you're crazy (uh)<br/>
And after all is said and done<br/>
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be<br/>
I may never trust someone<br/>
<br/>
But you won't break me<br/>
You'll just make me stronger than I was<br/>
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you<br/>
And if I stumble, I won't crumble<br/>
I'll get back up and uhhh<br/>
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"<br/>
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
