People got issues man<br/>
You gotta do something about that<br/>
You talking about me like you fucking know me man, like<br/>
It's funny man I go to sleep and I laugh at it<br/>
Don't even bother me no more<br/>
Yeah like, listen<br/>
<br/>
It's times like these when I feel regret<br/>
When I gotta work for this worthless cheque that don't pay for shit<br/>
I never finished school what do you expect? Me to be cool?<br/>
Yes? No? I don't think so<br/>
Well back in school they tell me<br/>
What if I start drowning are you gonna to be there to bail me? I don't think so<br/>
So please save the talk for someone else<br/>
I feel like I should have been someone else<br/>
But damn I'm not, I'm stuck in this hell spot<br/>
I fail to prevail so let my ass rot<br/>
I wish I was an abortion but I'm afraid not<br/>
A portion of my life is I'm happy I'm here<br/>
The rest is a blank spot<br/>
I think everything is going to be okay. Yeah, I think not!<br/>
I hate my life I bet you hate yours too<br/>
But what's the reason for being this motherfucking miserable?<br/>
People tell you to be positive how do you take that<br/>
When shit around you is negative and can't catch a break jack<br/>
<br/>
Why do I feel this way<br/>
I say why do I feel this way<br/>
See I got too much weight on my shoulder blades<br/>
How much more weight can I take<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
Man, I'm sick and tired of all this shit<br/>
How could you be so cold<br/>
<br/>
Then in school, don't you listen to them<br/>
They just pissed at you man they're just mad you're doing shit better than them<br/>
I swear you dope, fuck what they think<br/>
They can all suck a dick, suckers die they all fucking stink<br/>
They're shit, shit don't take it personal, this is the world we live in, shit stays in urinals<br/>
Complex self esteem issues, so they diss you to up themselves and make themselves feel special<br/>
Understand you're up there up where? up here nobody can touch you<br/>
Motherfucker you're nuts yeah,<br/>
you are not a quitter<br/>
you are sicker<br/>
than most of these little skanks so stop feeling bitter<br/>
about yourself<br/>
You know these suckers â€“ you're much bigger<br/>
You function on a different level, you're something like a ton bigger<br/>
Your tongue is fungus your skill is humongous<br/>
You know it so fuck it don't listen to these dumb kids<br/>
<br/>
Why do I feel this way<br/>
I say why do I feel this way<br/>
See I got too much weight on my shoulder blades<br/>
How much more weight can I take<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
Man, I'm sick and tired of all this shit<br/>
How could you be so cold<br/>
<br/>
The world is a cold ass place man you can't quit<br/>
If you quit you might as well call yourself dead<br/>
You know what I'm saying? So keep moving don't take shit personal<br/>
Don't let it get to you<br/>
Don't let them get the best of you, man<br/>
<br/>
I look toward my goal, so I move forward I know<br/>
If I stop now I'm proven that I'm no good and these haters win<br/>
I won't let that happen again, I'm a fighter a lighter bitch<br/>
I'mma fight till I retire,<br/>
I took a breath to rewired my wires<br/>
I'm Robocop back from the dead<br/>
The show don't stop till I roll over rot<br/>
I know that I'm hot, I don't need people to tell me that<br/>
Not even school to hold me back and tell me that I'm a failure<br/>
I'll nail your coffin, soft in your hard image<br/>
I'm starving and it is kinda crazy how I keep eating<br/>
Without taking a break and drinking a shake in between<br/>
Breast that I barely take or some water to wash down<br/>
This awful taste I wonder if anyone out there can relate<br/>
Man I'm losing any grasp I have on my fate<br/>
Cause I'm so rough soon no record deal on my plate<br/>
Half of those fuckers can't even see me<br/>
The other half wanna be me<br/>
The ones that don't know me don't know that I'm killing beats easy<br/>
Man I'm mad I can't understand it<br/>
Tell the planet to kiss my ass and<br/>
Grab a sweater and cram it, damn it<br/>
<br/>
Why do I feel this way<br/>
I say why do I feel this way<br/>
See I got too much weight on my shoulder blades<br/>
How much more weight can I take<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?<br/>
Man, I'm sick and tired of all this shit<br/>
How could you be so cold
