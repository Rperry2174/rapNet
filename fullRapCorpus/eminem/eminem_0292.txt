Psst... hey, listen! <br/>
Lalalalala! I love my job. Whoo! Makes me feel like Superman!<br/>
Can you fly? I can. Wanna see? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
I'm only entertaining you <br/>
My goal is to stimulate, making you high <br/>
And take you and I <br/>
To a place you can't see <br/>
But I believe you can fly <br/>
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying <br/>
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian <br/>
Just a man who's on the mic <br/>
So let me entertain you... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> <br/>
My lyrical content is constantly under fire <br/>
No wonder why I constantly bomb back <br/>
To combat attacks with constant concepts <br/>
When lyrics are constantly took outta context <br/>
Failure to communicate with congress has <br/>
Been a problem for the longest, I guess <br/>
But maybe one day we can make some progress <br/>
Food for thought - see how long it takes to digest <br/>
Feeling good when I should be ashamed <br/>
Sh*t, I really should've fell but I stood <br/>
See I came like a flame in the night <br/>
Like a ghost in the dark; there's a ray, there's a light <br/>
There's a hope, there's a spark <br/>
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye <br/>
Until they decide to set their differences aside <br/>
And this is why only one of us will survive <br/>
So children follow my lead and feel the vibe, cause <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> <br/>
My music can be slightly amusing <br/>
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing <br/>
Just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment <br/>
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it <br/>
See I could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond <br/>
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond <br/>
Cause I came here to uplift; let your woes be gone, <br/>
Tell 'em to get fu*ked and just mosie on <br/>
Constantly moving, constantly using the constitution <br/>
As a form of restitution <br/>
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant <br/>
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams <br/>
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuilding, <br/>
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim <br/>
How many kids'll copy? Probably millions, <br/>
But I'ma do this as a fu*king hobby till then, cause <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> <br/>
My lyrical content contains subject matter <br/>
That sucks up all these fu*ked up young kids <br/>
At an alarming rate; common denominate <br/>
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate <br/>
I try to stimulate but kids emulate, <br/>
And mimmick every move you make - "Slim, you great!" <br/>
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain? <br/>
I gotta be the one to go against the grain <br/>
Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane <br/>
For me to see you be influenced but pretend you ain't <br/>
But they don't understand that I've been through pain <br/>
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain <br/>
But you can't just stand there and try to judge <br/>
It hurts but you're jealousy probably tears you up inside as much <br/>
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch <br/>
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
