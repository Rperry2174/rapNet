<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It may not mean nothing to yall<br/>
But understand nothing was done for me<br/>
So I dont plan on stopping at all<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
Im shutting shit down at the mall<br/>
And telling every girl she the one for me<br/>
And I aint even planning to call<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Last name ever<br/>
First name greatest<br/>
Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing to play with<br/>
Started off local but thanks to all the haters<br/>
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis<br/>
In your city faded off the brown, Nino<br/>
She insists she got more class, we know<br/>
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo<br/>
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo<br/>
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like a album<br/>
Who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome<br/>
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm<br/>
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one<br/>
Yeah nigga I'm about my business<br/>
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list<br/>
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness<br/>
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness<br/>
Bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It may not mean nothing to yall<br/>
But understand nothing was done for me<br/>
So I dont plan on stopping at all<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
Im shutting shit down at the mall<br/>
And telling every girl she the one for me<br/>
And I aint even planning to call<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I used to have hood dreams<br/>
Big fame, big chains<br/>
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came<br/>
I went hard all fall like the ball teams<br/>
Just so I can make it rain all spring<br/>
Yall seen my story my glory<br/>
I had raped the game young<br/>
You can call it statutory<br/>
When a nigga blow up they gon build statures of me<br/>
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin<br/>
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin<br/>
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband<br/>
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt<br/>
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt<br/>
Youre such a fucking loser<br/>
He didnt even go to class Bueller<br/>
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back<br/>
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack<br/>
Chasing the stardom will turn you into a maniac<br/>
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act<br/>
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap<br/>
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It may not mean nothing to yall<br/>
But understand nothing was done for me<br/>
So I dont plan on stopping at all<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
Im shutting shit down at the mall<br/>
And telling every girl she the one for me<br/>
And I aint even planning to call<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ok, hello it's da Martian<br/>
Space jam Jordans<br/>
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden<br/>
Fresher than the harvest<br/>
Step up to the target<br/>
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans<br/>
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops<br/>
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top<br/>
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops<br/>
But what should I scream for this is my theme park<br/>
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark<br/>
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk<br/>
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention<br/>
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention<br/>
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer<br/>
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover<br/>
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas<br/>
No brake pads, no such thing as last<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It may not mean nothing to yall<br/>
But understand nothing was done for me<br/>
So I dont plan on stopping at all<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
Im shutting shit down at the mall<br/>
And telling every girl she the one for me<br/>
And I aint even planning to call<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow<br/>
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa<br/>
He can make them look like Bozos<br/>
He's wondering if he should spit this slow<br/>
Fuck no! Go for broke<br/>
His cup just runneth over, oh no<br/>
He aint had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed<br/>
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose<br/>
Back into the game and they know<br/>
Rap will never be the same as before<br/>
Bashing in the brains of these hoes<br/>
And establishing a name as he goes<br/>
The passion and the flame is ignited<br/>
You cant put it out once we light it<br/>
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot<br/>
You dealin with a few true villains<br/>
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin<br/>
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths<br/>
Now rewind it!<br/>
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?<br/>
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place<br/>
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face<br/>
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place<br/>
So Drake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It may not mean nothing to yall<br/>
But understand nothing was done for me<br/>
So I dont plan on stopping at all<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man<br/>
Im shutting shit down at the mall<br/>
And telling every girl she the one for me<br/>
And I aint even planning to call<br/>
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man
