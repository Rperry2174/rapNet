<i>[Chorus: Eminem repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back) <br/>
I'm Back (I'm Back) (SLIM SHADY!) I'm Back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I murder a rhyme one word at a time<br/>
You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine<br/>
You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help<br/>
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?<br/>
I'm waitin for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell<br/>
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail<br/>
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve<br/>
Thirteen I was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf<br/>
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block<br/>
'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox<br/>
("Mom! MOM!") I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less<br/>
What do I think of suc-cess? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed<br/>
Too much stares two breasts, too upset<br/>
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)<br/>
Grew up quick (no) was raised right<br/>
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right<br/>
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"<br/>
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-<br/>
-T-E, cuz MTV was so friendly to me<br/>
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me<br/>
Now is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?<br/>
Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't workin?<br/>
You hear this finger? Oh it's upside down<br/>
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it<br/>
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music<br/>
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim<br/>
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe <br/>
<i>[vocal scratches]</i> My name is Slim Shady<br/>
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me<br/>
The sensational <i>[vocal scratch "Back is the incredible!"]</i><br/>
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible<br/>
It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet<br/>
Tryin to, lure your kids with him, into bed<br/>
It's a, sick world we live in these days<br/>
"Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"<br/>
Geez, you guys are so sensitive<br/>
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"<br/>
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic<br/>
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin 'em<br/>
with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented<br/>
Doin lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin out <br/>
all high and indo scented (inhales, exhales)<br/>
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I take seven (kids) from (Columbine), stand 'em all in line<br/>
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine<br/>
a Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine<br/>
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time<br/>
Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy<br/>
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing<br/>
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?<br/>
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?<br/>
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?<br/>
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?<br/>
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things<br/>
Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)<br/>
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger<br/>
longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina<br/>
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz<br/>
it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!<br/>
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother<br/>
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her<br/>
and have a son and a new brother at the same time<br/>
and just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem {vocal scratching}]</i><br/>
Guess who's b-back, back<br/>
Gue-gue-guess who's back (Hi mom!)<br/>
<i>[scratch]</i> Guess who's back<br/>
<i>[scratch]</i> Gue <i>[scratch]</i> guess who's back<br/>
D-12 <i>[scratch]</i> Guess who's back<br/>
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back<br/>
Dr. Dre <i>[scratch]</i> Guess who's back<br/>
Back back <i>[scratch]</i> back<br/>
<i>[scratch]</i><br/>
Slim Shady, 2001<br/>
I'm blew out from this blunt (sighs) fuck
