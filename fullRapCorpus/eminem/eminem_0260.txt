<i>[2Pac]</i><br/>
Get on yo knees nigga, get on yo knees and pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[radio tuning in]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ja Rule]</i><br/>
Em, you claim ya mother's a crackhead and kim is a known slut so what's Hailie gon' be when she grows up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Em &amp; Hailie]</i><br/>
<i>[E]</i> AH-HA! Yeah! C'mon!<br/>
G-g-g-g G-Unit! Hailie<br/>
<i>[H]</i> What?<br/>
<i>[E]</i> Come here baby, bring daddy his Oscar<br/>
<i>[H]</i> Okay<br/>
<i>[E]</i> We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass!<br/>
<i>[H - laughs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vesre 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Swift]</i><br/>
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple<br/>
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and talkin' bout a pencil<br/>
Lookit what the fuck you done got into<br/>
I see you found yo niche, you just a bitch wit a menstrol<br/>
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong<br/>
You put 'e' before the 'd' cuz that's all you on<br/>
You on Pac's dick, you a regular guy<br/>
If Pac was still alive you would never get by<br/>
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real<br/>
Life is more than imitating niggaz and eatin' pills<br/>
And kind of muthafucka ruins three deals<br/>
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills<br/>
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated<br/>
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cuz he need it<br/>
And all you niggaz hatin', shut you mouths<br/>
It's just that real niggaz ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice]</i><br/>
Do-ra-mi, but we don't sing muhfuckas<br/>
So Murder Inc. do ya thing muhfuckas<br/>
You've unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less<br/>
Than R&amp;B comin' from that regime<br/>
Regime it's a little extreme<br/>
Neck and necks with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines<br/>
Ja sold his soul to sing<br/>
Weave eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed<br/>
Now that you've embraced the green<br/>
Don't fuck with the triple beams<br/>
You's a muthafuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin' rapper<br/>
Slash Billie Holliday how it happen?<br/>
Artist for Repetuar saw him in action<br/>
Pac assassination Def Jam grabbed him<br/>
Told him reinact him, you go platinum<br/>
They seen it for sure, I know that Afina Shakur<br/>
Don't enjoy Jeffery Atkins reinactin' her boy<br/>
So I'm click-clackin' this toy<br/>
Mash and destroy, Shady<br/>
Aftermath and Detroit muthafuckas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Do-ra-me, fa-so-la-ti-da<br/>
Don't blame me cuz you lost your boss's spot<br/>
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa<br/>
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac<br/>
Don't make me, too hot and you're not<br/>
Shootin' at me, with the only shot you got<br/>
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac<br/>
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<i>[Kuniva]</i><br/>
Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs<br/>
To the greivance and the cryin' and the intimate hugs<br/>
We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga<br/>
And you can't replace the late greal one<br/>
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one<br/>
Nigga please, stick to the script<br/>
before the guns stick to the clip, and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch<br/>
Fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen<br/>
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive<br/>
Wait a minute, hold on<br/>
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?<br/>
A bitch made man, now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a tyrannasaurus rex?<br/>
You niggaz can scream holler and curse<br/>
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya purse<br/>
<i>[Proof]</i><br/>
Slim did it simple to get at the wankstas<br/>
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas<br/>
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on<br/>
Put you ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones<br/>
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?<br/>
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us<br/>
It's real business you ain't caught the concept<br/>
You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press<br/>
Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source<br/>
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch<br/>
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us<br/>
But Detroit niggaz ?? and ain't scurred to bust<br/>
<i>[Kon Artis]</i><br/>
Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up<br/>
Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater<br/>
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina<br/>
Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox<br/>
press tight on the trigger of this glock<br/>
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat<br/>
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep<br/>
You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac<br/>
You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Eminem overdubs chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again!<br/>
Fuckin' punk pussy little bitch!<br/>
I'll fuck you up boy!<br/>
Never! Never in your muthafuckin life!<br/>
I'll choke the shit outchu little muthafuckin bitch!<br/>
Hailie can whip your muthafuckin ass!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice speaking]</i><br/>
That's right muthafuckas<br/>
Shady records, whatchu know about it?<br/>
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule<br/>
Nigga, this Obie Triceright here talkin to you muthafuckas<br/>
Ja Rule punk ass... Yea!<br/>
Fuckin Soul For Real ass...<br/>
Nigga that's Soul For Real,<br/>
That the nigga from Soul For Real!<br/>
Candy Rain ass nigga...<br/>
He got a deal now he rappin'<br/>
You'ont know what's... faggot ass muhfuckas<br/>
Get money to all my real niggas, man<br/>
Obie Trice, D12, G Unit, 50 Cent...<br/>
Hailie Jade!!!<br/>
<i>[50 Cent (laughing)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie]</i><br/>

<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
