<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you wish to be<br/>
saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or<br/>
which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should<br/>
move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1- Eminem]</i><br/>
Come on, let's cut the bullshit enough<br/>
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up<br/>
Let's take this shit back to basement<br/>
And we can discuss statements thats made on this tape<br/>
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love<br/>
The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy<br/>
Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit<br/>
Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory<br/>
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me<br/>
You will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here<br/>
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere<br/>
From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there<br/>
From the black side all the way to the white side<br/>
OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide<br/>
You may call it a past I call it hauling my ass<br/>
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks<br/>
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks<br/>
Them good old notorious oh well known tracks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
So lets go back<br/>
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode<br/>
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place<br/>
I once used to call home sweet home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2- Eminem]</i><br/>
I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter<br/>
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike<br/>
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke<br/>
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard<br/>
And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark<br/>
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark<br/>
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's<br/>
Thats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps<br/>
At Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows<br/>
At Centerline High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime<br/>
He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme<br/>
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place<br/>
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike<br/>
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined<br/>
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
So lets go back<br/>
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode<br/>
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place<br/>
I once used to call home sweet home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3- Eminem]</i><br/>
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school<br/>
It was cool till your man MC Shan came through<br/>
And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the clan makes troops<br/>
It was rumors but man, god damn, they flew<br/>
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes<br/>
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too<br/>
And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news<br/>
Guess who came through next, X-clan debut<br/>
Professor X vanglorious exists in a state of red, black, and green<br/>
With a key sissies now with this being a new trend<br/>
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums<br/>
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions<br/>
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant<br/>
Me and my man Howard and Butter, we would go to the mall with 'em<br/>
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all<br/>
We was being laughed at you ain't even half black<br/>
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that<br/>
And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that<br/>
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement<br/>
saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is...<br/>
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time<br/>
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl<br/>
At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me<br/>
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus<br/>
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs<br/>
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it<br/>
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time<br/>
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy<br/>
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl<br/>
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad<br/>
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize<br/>
I was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
So lets go back<br/>
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode<br/>
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place<br/>
I once used to call home sweet home
