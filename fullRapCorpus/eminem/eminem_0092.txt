<i>[Dre (Em)]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
(Definitely, definitely, definitely, dope, definitely, definitely K-mart)<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem (Dr. Dre):]</i><br/>
You find me offensive, I find you offensive<br/>
For finding me offensive<br/>
Hence, if I should draw the line on any fences<br/>
If so to what extent<br/>
If at any should I go<br/>
'Cause it's getting expensive<br/>
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive<br/>
They say I cause extensive<br/>
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,<br/>
Far at other peoples' expenses<br/>
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive<br/>
It's censorship<br/>
And it's down right blasphemous<br/>
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this<br/>
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither<br/>
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either<br/>
He used to be like a hero to me<br/>
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator<br/>
Right next to Darth Vader<br/>
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later<br/>
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that<br/>
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor<br/>
I killed Superman, I killed Super--man<br/>
And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy<br/>
Kryptonite: The Green Chronic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
'Cause I ain't got no legs!<br/>
Or no brain, nice to meet you<br/>
Hi, my name is...<br/>
I forgot my name!<br/>
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame<br/>
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is....<br/>
Rain Man<br/>
<br/>
Now in the Bible it says<br/>
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed,<br/>
Have homosexual sex<br/>
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in<br/>
Then, of course, it's intercourse<br/>
And it's bi-sexual sex<br/>
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions<br/>
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which<br/>
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases<br/>
That are more used by today's kids<br/>
In a more derogatory way but<br/>
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?<br/>
Let's ask Dr. Dre<br/>
Dr. Dre? (What up?)<br/>
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)<br/>
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)<br/>
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)<br/>
But, up I ain't done yet<br/>
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt<br/>
While he reaches in another grown man's ass<br/>
Grabs on his nuts but just what if<br/>
It was never meant it was just an accident<br/>
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in<br/>
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it<br/>
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit<br/>
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but<br/>
What if he pictured it as a females butt?<br/>
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up<br/>
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You find me offensive, I find you offensive<br/>
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this<br/>
When am I gonna come to my good senses?<br/>
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses<br/>
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby<br/>
And my plan is to get him next<br/>
And open up a whip-ass canister<br/>
Goddamn it Dre where's the god damn beat? (Yeah)<br/>
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it<br/>
This is the only thing that I'm good at<br/>
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic<br/>
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it<br/>
I got it, high five Nick Lachey<br/>
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away<br/>
And as she flew around the room like a balloon<br/>
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna<br/>
Out the trash can and zoom<br/>
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch<br/>
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich<br/>
And I ain't even gotta make no god damn sense<br/>
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH<br/>
Yo, Rain Man<br/>
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and<br/>
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million<br/>
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three<br/>
And seventy (Yeah)
