Hey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man<br/>
Ya'll been here every weekend man, <br/>
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!<br/>
That's cause you whack!<br/>

Nigga my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first, <br/>

No no man, I'm going first, <br/>
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man<br/>
You always rap first, <br/>
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say, <br/>
I'm fresh, I'm fresh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thyme:]</i><br/>
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
Point him out man I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know<br/>
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
Point him out bitch I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Eminem]</i><br/>
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice<br/>
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes<br/>
Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan<br/>
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband<br/>
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got<br/>
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot<br/>
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask<br/>
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask<br/>
It's an amazing task to battle with success<br/>
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less<br/>
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians<br/>
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions<br/>
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you<br/>
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra<br/>
So feel the force of my spiritual images<br/>
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages<br/>
My skin itches every time a rapper recites<br/>
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites<br/>
You wanna see fights I got a match for you<br/>
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Thyme]</i><br/>
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
Point him out man I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know<br/>
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
Point him out bitch I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Eminem]</i><br/>
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me<br/>
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me<br/>
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier<br/>
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria<br/>
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see<br/>
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be<br/>
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake<br/>
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break<br/>
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake<br/>
I'll twist you into a different shape<br/>
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake<br/>
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake<br/>
Every dis you can take, personal<br/>
We ain't friends trying to make amends<br/>
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence<br/>
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces<br/>
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason<br/>
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic<br/>
So pass it like a hot potato<br/>
I've never been less than clever and fresh<br/>
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Thyme]</i><br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
Point him out man I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know<br/>
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow?<br/>
Point him out bitch I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?<br/>
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know<br/>
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
Point him out!! I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know<br/>
Ayo let me get that mic man√Ö<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!!<br/>
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit
