<i>[Intro - Cowboy (Jeff Bass):]</i><br/>
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts<br/>
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon<br/>
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over<br/>
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em<br/>
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen<br/>
Got murdered in cold-blood<br/>
That old saloon there was their little "home away from home"<br/>
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern<br/>
And on a quiet night<br/>
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet<br/>
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat<br/>
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph<br/>
And a noise is spread, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head<br/>
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed<br/>
Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead<br/>
Told him each one of his boys is dead<br/>
I asked him to come to the dark side<br/>
He made a choice and said...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce:]</i><br/>
Who hard? Yo I done heard worse<br/>
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other<br/>
To see which one'll swerve first<br/>
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds<br/>
That of a globe on top of nine other planets<br/>
Kissed the cheek of the Devil<br/>
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto<br/>
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man<br/>
Disgraced the race of an atheist<br/>
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot<br/>
One track sliced without swords<br/>
I buried the Christ corpse<br/>
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse<br/>
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation<br/>
Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil<br/>
And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people<br/>
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal<br/>
Above the law cause I don't agree with police either (Shit, me neither)<br/>
We ain't eager to be legal<br/>
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle<br/>
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts<br/>
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle<br/>
Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range<br/>
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain<br/>
(He's insane)<br/>
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off<br/>
Cause I can't find a decent vein<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce:]</i><br/>
The disaster with dreads<br/>
I'm bad enough to commit suicide<br/>
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead<br/>
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter<br/>
Cause I serve any stranger with money<br/>
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains<br/>
While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches<br/>
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral<br/>
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it<br/>
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws<br/>
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass<br/>
I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs<br/>
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me<br/>
From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough<br/>
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
<i>[phone rings]</i><br/>
Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get you)<br/>
STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?<br/>
I'm the one who burned your house down, well I'm out now<br/>
And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up<br/>
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of<br/>
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms<br/>
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms<br/>
And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave<br/>
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce and Eminem:]</i><br/>
Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil<br/>
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people<br/>
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal<br/>
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel<br/>
(We'll be waiting) See you in hell<br/>
Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady<br/>
See you in hell for the sequel (bye-bye)<br/>
Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cowboy:]</i><br/>
And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil<br/>
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county<br/>
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens<br/>
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did<br/>
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon<br/>
But their spirits still live on till this day<br/>
Shhh...<i>[spits]</i> wait, did y'all hear that?<br/>
<i>[Footsteps and windblowing]</i>
