<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
{Hollywood}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
{Why do I feel this way}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I thought I had it all figured out, I did<br/>
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim<br/>
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once<br/>
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs<br/>
Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave<br/>
How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me<br/>
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt<br/>
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me<br/>
The minute shit was heated she just bailed<br/>
i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself<br/>
I couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell<br/>
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt<br/>
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground<br/>
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail<br/>
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female<br/>
I need to slow down<br/>
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now i'm...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look<br/>
At nothin', this world's too much<br/>
I've swallowed all I could<br/>
If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would, and end it for good<br/>
Just say goodbye to Hollywood<br/>
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once<br/>
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up<br/>
I think i'm bottomin' out<br/>
But i'm not about to give up, I gotta get up<br/>
Thank God, I got a little girl<br/>
And I'm a responsible father<br/>
So not a lot of good, i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud<br/>
Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it<br/>
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad<br/>
Cause I hate him so bad<br/>
The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man<br/>
If you could understand why I am the way that I am<br/>
What do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em i'm...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it<br/>
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick<br/>
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick<br/>
Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick<br/>
Fuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats<br/>
If I scrap, i'll scrap like I ain't never whooped some ass<br/>
I love my fans<br/>
But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything I have<br/>
I never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at, this is whack<br/>
This is more than I ever could of asked<br/>
everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask<br/>
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that<br/>
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped<br/>
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped<br/>
I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back<br/>
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact<br/>
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein',<br/>
everything blow up and all you did was just grow<br/>
up emceeing<br/>
It's fuckin' crazy<br/>
Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had<br/>
But instead I forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood, {Goodbye},<br/>
please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good,<br/>
{this shit is not for me},<br/>
so goodbye, goodbye Hollywood,<br/>
{i'm not a fuckin' star},<br/>
please don't cry for me, when I'm gone for good,<br/>
{i'm goin' back home}...
