<i>[Royce Da 5'9":]</i><br/>
Uh, first verse, uh<br/>
I'm on 'til I'm on a island<br/>
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot<br/>
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill y'all for kindness<br/>
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse<br/>
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform<br/>
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform<br/>
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on<br/>
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn<br/>
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know<br/>
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'<br/>
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole<br/>
Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow<br/>
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke<br/>
Though I ain't wrapped tight<br/>
My blood type's the '80s!<br/>
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys<br/>
You still fly kites daily!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Catch me in my Mercedes<br/>
Bumpin' "Ice, Ice Baby, " screamin' Shady 'til I die<br/>
Like I have a pair of dice, life's crazy<br/>
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze<br/>
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady<br/>
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)<br/>
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous<br/>
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this<br/>
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!<br/>
You morons think that I'm a genius<br/>
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks<br/>
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby<br/>
And that's back with' a capital B with' an exclamation mark, maybe<br/>
You should listen when I flip the linguistics<br/>
'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit<br/>
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit<br/>
'Cause after I spit the bullets, Imma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball<br/>
Imma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, Imma live this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Livin' life in the fast lane<br/>
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down<br/>
Only got a gallon in the gas tank<br/>
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride<br/>
Gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die<br/>
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)<br/>
Livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce Da 5'9":]</i><br/>
My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit<br/>
At war with' a bottle, as Captain Morgan attacks my organs<br/>
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins<br/>
I made a pact with the Devil that says "I'll let you take me<br/>
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"<br/>
Go 'back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in<br/>
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down<br/>
My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers<br/>
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper<br/>
Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out<br/>
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down<br/>
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now<br/>
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town<br/>
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all,<br/>
He shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round<br/>
And he came to the club tonight with' 5'9â€³ to hold this bitch down<br/>
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, she tryna d-dr-drown<br/>
Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated<br/>
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick suckin' lips, I'm agitated, aggravated<br/>
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated<br/>
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce:]</i><br/>
And then after takin' that, I'm a catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'<br/>
It's gon' say "The whole rap game passed away" on top of the affidavit<br/>
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator<br/>
To Michael Jackson' activator (Woo!)<br/>
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data<br/>
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer<br/>
Homie, they sick, you can normally ask a hater<br/>
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper<br/>
Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes<br/>
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator<br/>
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later<br/>
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt<br/>
You rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin' you're...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Livin' life in the fast lane<br/>
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down<br/>
Only got a gallon in the gas tank<br/>
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride<br/>
Gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die<br/>
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)<br/>
Life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)<br/>
<br/>
Pedal to the metal<br/>
Pedal to the metal
