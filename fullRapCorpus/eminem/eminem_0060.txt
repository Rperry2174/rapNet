<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
People!! It feels so good to be back.<br/>
Ladies and gentleman, introducing the new and improved you know who<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Never been the type to bend or budge<br/>
The wrong button to push,<br/>
No friend of Bush<br/>
I'm the centerpiece, you're the Maltese.<br/>
I am a pitbull off his leash,<br/>
All this peace talk can cease.<br/>
All these people I had to leave in limbo,<br/>
I'm back now,<br/>
I've come to release this info<br/>
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple.<br/>
Can-a-bitch don't want no beef with Slim?<br/>
Noooo!<br/>
Not even on my radar,<br/>
So won't you please jump off my dick<br/>
Lay off and stay off,<br/>
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance,<br/>
Aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2:]</i><br/>
You all c'mon now,<br/>
Let's all get on down,<br/>
Let's do-si-do now,<br/>
We're gonna have a good ol' time.<br/>
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about,<br/>
Let your hair down,<br/>
And square dance with me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Let your hair down to the track,<br/>
Yeah kick on back.<br/>
Boo!<br/>
The boogies monster of rap,<br/>
Yeah the man's back<br/>
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration,<br/>
Mush the Senate's face in and push this generation,<br/>
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like,<br/>
This white hot light,<br/>
That I'm under,<br/>
No wonder,<br/>
I look so sunburnt,<br/>
Oh no,<br/>
I won't leave no stone unturned,<br/>
Oh no I won't leave,<br/>
Won't go nowhere,<br/>
Do-si-do,<br/>
Oh, yo, ho, hello there<br/>
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there,<br/>
Go to the Beirut and do a show there<br/>
Yeah you laugh till your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted,<br/>
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen,<br/>
Till you fuck around,<br/>
Get an anthrax napkin,<br/>
Inside a package wrapped in saran Wrap wrapping,<br/>
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping,<br/>
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtracks crashing,<br/>
All this terror America demands action,<br/>
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'<br/>
To join the army or what you'll do for there Navy.<br/>
You just a baby,<br/>
Gettin' recruited at eighteen,<br/>
You're on a plane now,<br/>
Eating their food and their baked beans.<br/>
I'm 28,<br/>
They gonna take you 'fore they take me<br/>
Crazy insane or insane crazy?<br/>
When I say Hussein you say Shady,<br/>
My views ain't changed still Inhumane,<br/>
Wait,<br/>
Arraigned two days late,<br/>
The date's today,<br/>
Hang me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Nothin' moves me more than a groove the soothes me,<br/>
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove<br/>
that boosts me,<br/>
Nothin' boosts me more,<br/>
Or suits me beautifully,<br/>
There's nothin' you can do to me,<br/>
Stab me,<br/>
Shoot me,<br/>
Psychotic,<br/>
Hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic.<br/>
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada<br/>
God I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la,<br/>
oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta,<br/>
Keep movin',<br/>
There's more music to make,<br/>
Keep makin' new shit,<br/>
Produce hits to break<br/>
the monotony,<br/>
What's gotten into me?<br/>
Drug's, rock and Hennessey,<br/>
Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies,<br/>
On your knees,<br/>
Got you under seige,<br/>
Somebody you would give a lung to be hungry,<br/>
Like a fuckin' younger me,<br/>
Fuck the fee,<br/>
I can get you jumped for free,<br/>
Yah buddy,<br/>
Laugh it's funny,<br/>
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing,<br/>
I'm past bluffing,<br/>
Pass the K-Y,<br/>
Let's get ready for some intense,<br/>
serious ass fucking!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Dr. Dre., wants to square with me,<br/>
Nasty Nas, wants to square dance with me,<br/>
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me,<br/>
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me,<br/>
Cana-bitch won't square dance with me,<br/>
Fan-a-bitch, won't square dance with me,<br/>
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me,<br/>
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you-----YEE-HAW!!!
