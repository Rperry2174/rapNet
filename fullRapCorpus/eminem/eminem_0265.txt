<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Check Check, 1,2…1,2…1,2 (it's rolling)<br/>
Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here Y'all know what this is.<br/>
It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,<br/>
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.<br/>
Yo Eminem! show these mother fuckers what time it is baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit<br/>
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet<br/>
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it<br/>
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident<br/>
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam<br/>
I hate the straight jacket it ain’t latching, and can't lock it<br/>
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets<br/>
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it<br/>
Before me and just kept throwing they fucking self at it<br/>
My head is aching! I'm dedicated to medication<br/>
But this med is taking too long to bring me this sedadation? (Come on!)<br/>
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?)<br/>
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray<br/>
Running up and down the street screaming "Fuck the Police!"<br/>
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth (Fucking baby) <br/>
Became a role model after Colorado<br/>
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!<br/>
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public<br/>
Suck my dick bitch!<br/>
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't<br/>
Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place<br/>
So put a sock in it with your fake-ass Tupac image<br/>
You faggots ain't tough you just get drunk and become talkative (Wanna Fight?) <br/>
I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking<br/>
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket<br/>
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling<br/>
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does<br/>
I ain't buzzed! I'm just high on life<br/>
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites Motherfucker? Slim Shady<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i> <br/>
Dr. Dre!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I'm drunk pass the tec<br/>
Cause if I get locked up tonight!<br/>
Then I might not come home tonight!<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i> <br/>
Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on<br/>
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Cause if I get locked up tonight!<br/>
Then I might not come home tonight!<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on<br/>
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire<br/>
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!)<br/>
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake<br/>
Don’t get so bent out of shape<br/>
Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends<br/>
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me<br/>
Cause they don't know better<br/>
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up<br/>
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up<br/>
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home<br/>
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)<br/>
Shit, talk about your brain being baked<br/>
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees<br/>
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,<br/>
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter! fuck you lady!<br/>
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize<br/>
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes<br/>
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing<br/>
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit<br/>
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth<br/>
And shove his head in the fan blade<br/>
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say<br/>
Or change cause of the age-range in my fan base<br/>
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit<br/>
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit<br/>
Hip-Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now<br/>
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now<br/>
But now the White kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it<br/>
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night gets silent<br/>
Either that or booed, that’s why I keep an attitude<br/>
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon<br/>
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge<br/>
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Fuck that, turn that shit off<br/>
Let's get the fuck out of here<br/>
You know how we do <i>[echo]</i>
