Lord, please forgive me for what I do<br/>
For I know not what I've done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do<br/>
I just never had the chance to ever meet you<br/>
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be<br/>
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off<br/>
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)<br/>
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off<br/>
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)<br/>
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch<br/>
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)<br/>
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn<br/>
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in<br/>
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles<br/>
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)<br/>
They were the ones who were left in charge<br/>
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song<br/>
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)<br/>
It went a little something like<br/>
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb<br/>
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn<br/>
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand<br/>
And by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly<br/>
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me<br/>
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly<br/>
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream<br/>
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?<br/>
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-<br/>
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?<br/>
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch<br/>
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions<br/>
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in<br/>
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad<br/>
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it<br/>
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it<br/>
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard<br/>
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it<br/>
Man if I only had half of it<br/>
Shit, if you only knew the half of it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds<br/>
Please release me from these demons<br/>
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe<br/>
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry<br/>
Now look at all the pain I caused<br/>
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?<br/>
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?<br/>
Everything could have been so perfect<br/>
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air<br/>
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere<br/>
I don't even know why they feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel<br/>
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel<br/>
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round<br/>
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go<br/>
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now<br/>
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be<br/>
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be<br/>
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on<br/>
'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
