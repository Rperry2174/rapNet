<i>[*baby crying*]</i><br/>
<br/>
One thousand different houses and MÃ¼nchhausen<br/>
I'mma make you wanna punch out some-fucking-one<br/>
"Ouch!" What the fuck'd you hit me for?<br/>
Scream "life" as I punch counter and bunches out of anger<br/>
I once encountered a stranger<br/>
In a dumb gown, black hood<br/>
With a scythe<br/>
Shit I laughed in his face spit<br/>
Bitch gave me an extra life, like "Take this!"<br/>
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch<br/>
Don't take shit for granted<br/>
And don't take shit, give it!<br/>
Only bull you should take is by the horns<br/>
A mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor<br/>
I everlast, pen is mightier than sword<br/>
Finish writing then record<br/>
Replenish, keep writing more<br/>
Nothing's riding on it but your pride is all you're fighting for<br/>
So you fight, scratch, you claw<br/>
Back's to wall<br/>
No one was there to catch you fall<br/>
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off<br/>
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and<br/>
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it<br/>
Pull out your pass for whooping ass and flash it on 'em<br/>
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner<br/>
You're a hornet<br/>
No one's more ignorant<br/>
Than you fuckin' four in the morning<br/>
You're at the laboratory, storming<br/>
Like there's nothing that's more important<br/>
MC's you better consider this a formal warning<br/>
You're in for it<br/>
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain<br/>
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?<br/>
I ain't finished, bitch<br/>
I meant in half, oil the blades<br/>
Nobody wants to play<br/>
They say I'm a spoiled little baby<br/>
But<br/>
<br/>
Nobody puts baby in the corner<br/>
I'm only tryna warn ya<br/>
'Cause that baby gets mad<br/>
And gets to throwing a tantrum<br/>
He'll fucking flip on ya<br/>
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner<br/>
I'm only tryna warn ya<br/>
'Cause that baby gets mad<br/>
And gets to throwing a tantrum<br/>
He'll fucking flip on ya<br/>
<br/>
What goes through an addict's brain?<br/>
Besides static pain and Big Daddy Kane<br/>
Breakbeats and words<br/>
An erratic train of thought<br/>
Like splatter paint<br/>
Scatter-brained<br/>
Yeah maybe that explains<br/>
Why you're back but don't rap the same<br/>
And you're looking way thinner<br/>
'Cause your hunger got you looking like<br/>
They took away dinner (chooka)<br/>
"Sugar Ray" Leonard wouldn't sugar-coat a fucking booger though<br/>
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat<br/>
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what<br/>
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips<br/>
Hope it lands on another rap singer's lips<br/>
Who can't think of shit<br/>
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit<br/>
Who's king of this fucking English Lit?<br/>
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand<br/>
While extending this shit<br/>
How low can you go?<br/>
Lower than Chuck D ho<br/>
Hear the bassiness in my voice?<br/>
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?<br/>
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius<br/>
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots to rap<br/>
Not a man, I'm a weapon<br/>
Who just happened to be a rapper<br/>
Who just happen to be on the crapper<br/>
When it happened I had an epiphany<br/>
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after<br/>
Now I'm back with an appe-tite<br/>
For destruction, the fucking recipe for disaster<br/>
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished<br/>
Every deed is a dastardly one<br/>
Evilish bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-lite<br/>
To people's like me havin' my teeth pulled<br/>
<br/>
Nobody puts baby in the corner<br/>
I'm only tryna warn ya<br/>
'Cause that baby gets mad<br/>
And gets to throwing a tantrum<br/>
He'll fucking flip on ya<br/>
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner<br/>
I'm only tryna warn ya<br/>
'Cause that baby gets mad<br/>
And gets to throwing a tantrum<br/>
He'll fucking flip on ya<br/>
<br/>
So step inside a dimension<br/>
The demented side of a mind<br/>
That's like an inside of an engine<br/>
While I multiply your undivided attention<br/>
But be reminded: if I didn't mention<br/>
I lose my mind and my temper<br/>
You'll be the first one<br/>
Who finds him offensive<br/>
Got him climbing the fences<br/>
Lost some time to addiction<br/>
But look up rhyme in the dictionary<br/>
I'm in the picture<br/>
Eminem is the synonym for it<br/>
I'm an enigma<br/>
Fuck it, let's get to the meat balls<br/>
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes<br/>
Edumacator they are<br/>
Shit legends are made of<br/>
Spit treacherous data<br/>
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy<br/>
This wretched is<br/>
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada<br/>
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman<br/>
With methamphetamines in his left hand<br/>
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer<br/>
In pajamas, standing in front of a webcam<br/>
Beating himself in the head, 'til Russell let's him off Def Jam<br/>
Maybe I need my head examined<br/>
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb<br/>
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan<br/>
I need meds!<br/>
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge<br/>
T.I. ain't talking me off a ledge man<br/>
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah<br/>
More like a smart slob, part blob<br/>
That'll stab you with a sharp object<br/>
To the heart and leave claw marks<br/>
All over the Wal-Mart walls<br/>
Little baby with large balls<br/>
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging<br/>
There's nothing on this fucking Earth better than being<br/>
The king of the playground<br/>
I hate the swings but I love being an underdog<br/>
'Cause when I'm pushed<br/>
I end up swinging up<br/>
<br/>
Nobody puts baby in the corner<br/>
I'm only tryna warn ya<br/>
'Cause that baby gets mad<br/>
And gets to throwing a tantrum<br/>
He'll fucking flip on ya<br/>
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner<br/>
I'm only tryna warn ya<br/>
'Cause that baby gets mad<br/>
And gets to throwing a tantrum<br/>
He'll fucking flip on ya
