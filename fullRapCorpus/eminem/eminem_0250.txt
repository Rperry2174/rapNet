I don't wanna say goodbye<br/>
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like<br/>
All I wanna do is cry<br/>
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight<br/>
<br/>
Farewell miss I know that you can care less<br/>
But I'm sorry for everything I was careless<br/>
But I need you to know that I love you so much<br/>
And I've been drinking myself to sleep my soul's crushed<br/>
A couple more shots I know I'm gonna go nuts<br/>
I can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch<br/>
I was in love with you how could you do this to me<br/>
Actually I did this to myself, what a tragedy!<br/>
And now what do I do?<br/>
Where do I go?<br/>
Cause everywhere I go I see your face<br/>
It's hard starting over<br/>
Trying to find another shoulder<br/>
To lean on<br/>
I feel like my whole life just got peed on<br/>
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain<br/>
As crazy as it sounds to me it's sane<br/>
And I like it, why? 'cause I feel like we're still united<br/>
In some weird way I don't wanna fight it<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna say goodbye<br/>
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like<br/>
All I wanna do is cry<br/>
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight<br/>
<br/>
I wrote you the other day and you didn't write back!<br/>
It's like that!? after all the crap we been through!?<br/>
I can't believe you! I know I fucked up!<br/>
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!<br/>
You keep sending me to voicemail!<br/>
I'm annoyed, hell!, shit you coulda at least sent a text<br/>
But you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips<br/>
While I'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!<br/>
You're hard headed a sharp headache<br/>
I need help call a medic<br/>
I just cut myself, yeah, I did it<br/>
Without you I'm nothing don't you get it!?<br/>
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it!<br/>
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that<br/>
We ever met, I can't believe you just said that<br/>
You're so cold you just hit me so low<br/>
I can't take this no more, so hit the road<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna say goodbye<br/>
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like<br/>
All I wanna do is cry<br/>
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight<br/>
<br/>
Some things just don't seem the way they do<br/>
One day you tell me I love you and only you<br/>
I wake up to find out it was a dream<br/>
You're telling me you hate me, you're leaving me<br/>
People change everything changes<br/>
We go from best friends then become strangers<br/>
We go from seeing each other everyday then<br/>
Farewell to never seeing your face again<br/>
<br/>
I can't get you outta of my head<br/>
So I'm out of bed at 4 in the morning<br/>
Wishing I was dead<br/>
But for some odd reason I can't do it<br/>
For some reason I needed to write<br/>
What's on my mind and what's going through it<br/>
Cause if I don't I'll probably suffocate<br/>
Why do you have so much hate<br/>
Towards me you need some loving babe<br/>
God I fucking love you I hate myself<br/>
For falling in love with you<br/>
Just to find out all I did was trouble you<br/>
My heart is aching I'm medicated<br/>
I tried meditating<br/>
But nothing works I don't even feel sedated<br/>
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second<br/>
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked<br/>
Fuck humiliation, you do anything to get me back<br/>
Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact<br/>
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good<br/>
And do everything to have me if you could<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna say goodbye<br/>
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like<br/>
All I wanna do is cry<br/>
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight
