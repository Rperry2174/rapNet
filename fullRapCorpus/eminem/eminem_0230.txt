I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist<br/>
They call me Slim Roethlisberger<br/>
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker<br/>
A merk her with a Mossberg<br/>
I'm pissed off get murdered<br/>
Like someone took a ketchup squirter<br/>
Squirted a frankfurter<br/>
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants<br/>
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving<br/>
Like a terrible towel<br/>
I faced her around<br/>
But his fangs come out<br/>
Get your brains blown out<br/>
That's what I call blowing your mind<br/>
When I come back<br/>
Like nut on your spine<br/>
I'm a thumb tack<br/>
That you slept on son<br/>
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one<br/>
Low on the totem till he showed 'em<br/>
Defiance, giant scrotum<br/>
He don't owe them bitches shit<br/>
His bridges, he out grow'd em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Taylor]</i><br/>
Come on, come on don't leave me like this<br/>
I thought I had you figured out<br/>
Something's gone terribly wrong<br/>
You're all I wanted<br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on don't leave me like this<br/>
I thought I had you figured out<br/>
Can't breath whenever you gone<br/>
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted<br/>
<br/>
I'm back for revenge<br/>
I lost a battle that ain't happening again<br/>
I'm at your throat like strep<br/>
I step, strapped with a pen<br/>
Metaphors wrote on my hand,<br/>
Someone distorted my mint<br/>
Read some I wrote on a napkin<br/>
I do what I have to to win<br/>
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's<br/>
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers<br/>
And tell that psycho to pass the torch<br/>
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern<br/>
And smash it on his porch<br/>
Now get off my dick<br/>
Dick's too short a word for my dick<br/>
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick<br/>
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer<br/>
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer<br/>
I displaced my clause with enough plaster<br/>
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder<br/>
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me<br/>
See he's in a whole nother weight class<br/>
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets<br/>
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's<br/>
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties<br/>
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast<br/>
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E<br/>
<br/>
I'm haunted I'm dead your gone<br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on don't leave me like this<br/>
I thought I had you figured out<br/>
Something's gone terribly wrong<br/>
Won't finish what you started<br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on don't leave me like this<br/>
I thought I had you figured out<br/>
Can't breath whenever you gone<br/>
Can't go back, I'm haunted<br/>
<br/>
Oooooh<br/>
<br/>
You and I walk a fragile line<br/>
I have known it all this time<br/>
Never ever thought I'd see it break.<br/>
Never thought I'd see it
