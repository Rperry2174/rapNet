<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
All aboard, okay, next stop, my basementâ€¦ ha ha<br/>
I'll meet you down there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There once was a saying that I used to say<br/>
Back in the day when I met Dre<br/>
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof<br/>
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof<br/>
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him<br/>
That's not happening, that I can't fathom<br/>
Eighty something million records worldwide later,<br/>
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady<br/>
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me<br/>
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele<br/>
Woopsa that a fucking daisy<br/>
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy<br/>
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B<br/>
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me<br/>
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby<br/>
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up<br/>
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters<br/>
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner<br/>
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does<br/>
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started<br/>
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of<br/>
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust<br/>
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There once was a saying that I used to say<br/>
Back in the day when I met Dre<br/>
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof<br/>
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof<br/>
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him<br/>
That's not happening, that I can't fathom<br/>
Eighty something million records worldwide later,<br/>
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it<br/>
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots<br/>
It's all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it<br/>
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it<br/>
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing<br/>
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination<br/>
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation<br/>
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-<br/>
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him<br/>
Homie, I'm the sheisse, pass Doctor Dre some<br/>
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son<br/>
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son<br/>
I can't believe I leave for one brief second<br/>
And you pussys queef all over the rap game, naked<br/>
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it<br/>
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There once was a saying that I used to say<br/>
Back in the day when I met Dre<br/>
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof<br/>
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof<br/>
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him<br/>
That's not happening, that I can't fathom<br/>
Eighty something million records worldwide later<br/>
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later<br/>
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I<br/>
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em<br/>
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em<br/>
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street<br/>
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep<br/>
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep<br/>
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep<br/>
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?<br/>
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy<br/>
This is my house, all nine thousand feet<br/>
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth<br/>
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top<br/>
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop<br/>
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop<br/>
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There once was a saying that I used to say<br/>
Back in the day when I met Dre<br/>
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof<br/>
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof<br/>
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him<br/>
That's not happening, that I can't fathom<br/>
Eighty something million records worldwide later,<br/>
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit<br/>
This must be all that there is, this must be it<br/>
Fucking-A even got a bidet<br/>
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper<br/>
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off<br/>
I can just toss a flying saucer in it<br/>
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator<br/>
Living in a house with a fucking elevator
