<i>[2pac]</i><br/>
Get on your knees nigga, get on your knees and pray!<br/>
<i>[Ja Rule]</i><br/>
Em you claim your mothers a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what's Halie gonna be when she grows up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Ha ha, yeah, come on!<br/>
G-G-G-G-G-Unit<br/>
Hailie<br/>
<i>[Halie]</i> What??<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Come here baby<br/>
Bring daddy his Oscar<br/>
<i>[Halie]</i> Okay<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass<br/>
<i>[Halie laughs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swifty]</i><br/>
I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple<br/>
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil<br/>
Look at what the fuck you dun got into<br/>
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral<br/>
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong<br/>
You put the "E" before the "D" because that's all you on<br/>
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by<br/>
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills<br/>
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see<br/>
skills<br/>
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated<br/>
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it<br/>
And you niggas hating shut your mouths<br/>
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie]</i><br/>
Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers<br/>
So Murda Inc do your thing motherfuckers<br/>
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime<br/>
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines<br/>
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream<br/>
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams<br/>
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper<br/>
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?<br/>
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination<br/>
Def jam grabbed him, told him reenact him you'll go platinum<br/>
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins<br/>
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy<br/>
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da<br/>
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot<br/>
Mama say mama sa Macosaca<br/>
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac<br/>
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not<br/>
Going at me is the only shot you got<br/>
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac<br/>
You can get popped after all that shit you talk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kon Artis]</i><br/>
Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs<br/>
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs<br/>
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,<br/>
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga<br/>
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake<br/>
one<br/>
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip<br/>
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen<br/>
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on<br/>
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on<br/>
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex<br/>
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond<br/>
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Proof]</i><br/>
Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas<br/>
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas<br/>
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on<br/>
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones<br/>
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas<br/>
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us<br/>
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept<br/>
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats<br/>
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source<br/>
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch<br/>
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us<br/>
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kuniva]</i><br/>
Do I gotta get my nigga bugs, punks like you get beat up<br/>
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater<br/>
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils<br/>
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina<br/>
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox<br/>
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock<br/>
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat<br/>
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep<br/>
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your "mock"avelli get your own identity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da<br/>
(Don't EVER say my little girls name in a song again)<br/>
Don't play me cause you're washed up, lost your spot<br/>
Mama say mama sa Macosaca<br/>
(Fucking punk pussy, BITCH!)<br/>
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac<br/>
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not<br/>
(I'm gonna fuck you up boy)<br/>
Going at me is the only shot you got<br/>
(Never again in your mother fucking life)<br/>
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac<br/>
(Gonna shoot the shit outta you little fucking midgets,<br/>
Hailie will whip your mother fucking asses)<br/>
You can get popped after all that shit you talk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice]</i><br/>
