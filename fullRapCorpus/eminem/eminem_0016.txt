<i>[Bizarre]</i><br/>
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you<br/>
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha<br/>
<br/>
No one's iller than me (wha?)<br/>
No one, no one is iller than me<br/>
No one is iller than me<br/>
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swift]</i><br/>
I make rappers wanna turn into singers<br/>
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers<br/>
Bring this competition and face this meanin' <br/>
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas<br/>
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius<br/>
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters<br/>
Keep it close, you can't beat us<br/>
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this<br/>
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects<br/>
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret<br/>
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state<br/>
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate<br/>
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell<br/>
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals<br/>
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail<br/>
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well<br/>
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials<br/>
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels<br/>
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now<br/>
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?<br/>
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild<br/>
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!<br/>
<br/>
It's Swifty from the 313<br/>
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bizarre]</i><br/>
Me and Eminem and Mike<br/>
Drivin' down Van Dyke<br/>
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite<br/>
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason<br/>
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'<br/>
Last week this old man I had to blast<br/>
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas<br/>
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook<br/>
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook<br/>
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack<br/>
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at<br/>
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should<br/>
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!<br/>
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route <br/>
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "EVERYBODY GET OUT"!<br/>
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece<br/>
Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece<br/>
<br/>
No one, no one's iller than me<br/>
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313<br/>
No one, no one is iller than me<br/>
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy<br/>
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly<br/>
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs<br/>
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs<br/>
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs<br/>
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs<br/>
Down a fifth, crack open a six<br/>
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss<br/>
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends<br/>
Who gives a fuck who they was<br/>
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does<br/>
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?<br/>
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz<br/>
Mics get sandblasted<br/>
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid<br/>
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it<br/>
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket<br/>
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted<br/>
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic<br/>
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic<br/>
Furious four motherfuckers<br/>
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters<br/>
<br/>
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fuzz]</i><br/>
I run shit like an ass with legs<br/>
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red<br/>
Similar to your ass in a casket dead<br/>
Drastic spread of acid heads<br/>
Come to abort you like a bastard egg<br/>
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs<br/>
Ask the feds from past the edge<br/>
Rockin' the most classic threads<br/>
Flashin' bread, roll down the window<br/>
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red<br/>
You can get 'til that ass get red<br/>
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him<br/>
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem<br/>
Never writer's block, I block writers<br/>
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters<br/>
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick<br/>
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!<br/>
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' "Stop it..."<br/>
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit<br/>
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick<br/>
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits<br/>
I shoot a rocket through your optic<br/>
You niggaz still don't know the top pick?<br/>
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass<br/>
And have you shittin' socks bitch!<br/>
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split<br/>
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits<br/>
(No one...)<br/>
<br/>
Ain't nobody iller than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bizzare]</i><br/>
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313<br/>
No one, no one is iller than me<br/>
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313<br/>
No one, no one is iller than me<br/>
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313<br/>
<br/>
You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees!<br/>
From the home of potholes and trash<br/>
We'll lyrically blast...
