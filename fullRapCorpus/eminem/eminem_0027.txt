<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl<br/>
I never meant to bring you to my world<br/>
Now you sitting in the corner crying<br/>
And now it's my fault my fault<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave<br/>
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved<br/>
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up<br/>
with first aid tape and raped on the first date<br/>
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stoped usin.was into bosse and<br/>
alternative music. told me she was about to use it agzin. I said wiat first<br/>
try this hallucionagin, its better than heroin and the the booze and the gin.<br/>
come here lets go in here. Who's in the den? (It's me and Kelly) my bad! lets<br/>
try another room "I don't trust you" shut up slut chew up this mushroom. this<br/>
will help you get in touch with your roots. We'll get bare-foot but naked and run<br/>
in the woods. "oh hell might as well try 'em this party is so drag." Oh dag I<br/>
didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag! (huh)<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i> <br/>
<i>[1st repeat Em says "I'm sorry!" at the end]</i><br/>
<i>[2nd repeat same as original Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Yo Sue!"<br/>
<i>[G]</i> Get away from me, I don't know you<br/>
Oh shoot, she's tripping..<br/>
<i>[G]</i> I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)<br/>
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major<br/>
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature. <br/>
Susan stop crying i don't hate ya. the worlds not against you I'm sorry your<br/>
father raped ya. So what, you had your coochie in your dad's mouth. Thats no<br/>
reason to start wiggin and spaz out.<br/>
she said "Help me I think I'm having a seisure!"<br/>
I said "I'm high too (bitch) Quit grabbin my T-shirt (let go!)<br/>
Would you calm down you're startin to scare me.<br/>
she said " I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married. I don't have any<br/>
kids and I can't cook"<br/>
I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!<br/>
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late <br/>
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[1st repeat Em says "Whoops!" after first line and "It was an accident!" at the end]</i><br/>
<i>[2nd repeat same as original Chorus]</i><br/>
Susan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful<br/>
<i>[G]</i> Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled<br/>
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue<br/>
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb<br/>
I'll be right back just chill baby please?<br/>
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these.<br/>
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?"<br/>
<i>[J]</i> He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!<br/>
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance<br/>
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants<br/>
choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left <br/>
of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?"<br/>
<i>[D]</i> Well it depends on how many you had? I took three she ate the other<br/>
twenty-two caps Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs,drinking lysol.<br/>
"She's gonna die dude." I know and it's my fault!<br/>
My god!<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[1st repeat Em says "I'm sorry!" after second line and "What do I do?" at the end]</i><br/>
<i>[2nd repeat same as original Chorus]</i><br/>
My God, I'm so sorry!<br/>
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!<br/>
Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!<br/>
You're not dead!! You're NOT dead!<br/>
I know you're not dead!
