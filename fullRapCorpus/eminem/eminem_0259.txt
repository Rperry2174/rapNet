<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Come get me<br/>
Motherfuckers if you want Shady<br/>
If Pac was still here now,<br/>
He would never ride with Ja<br/>
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Makaveli rest in peace<br/>
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body<br/>
Mouth like a .12 gauge shotti<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
You ain't no killer, you a pussy<br/>
That ecstasy got you all emotional and moushy<br/>
Bitches wearing rags in photos, Ja's words being quoted<br/>
In the SOURCE, stealing 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it<br/>
You loud mouth, pray to god, hoping no ones listening<br/>
See 50 coming for me, I'ma guard my, my position<br/>
No one will pay attention<br/>
To me, please Gotti, here I go<br/>
Gimme this pill, ecstasy got me feeling so<br/>
Invincible<br/>
Now all of a sudden I'm a fucking mad man who screams<br/>
Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy<br/>
Acting like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY<br/>
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train<br/>
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fuck from this shit<br/>
I'm stuck, I'm addicted from these drugs, I'ma quit<br/>
Saying motherfucker's name's before someone fucks me up<br/>
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you hell, fucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem Sings]</i><br/>
Come get me<br/>
If you motherfuckers want Shady<br/>
If Pac was still here now,<br/>
He would never ride with Ja<br/>
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na<br/>
<br/>
Get off that E<br/>
Before you try to fuck with me<br/>
It's Aftermath here now<br/>
Shady Records got it locked<br/>
La, la, la, la , la, la, la, la<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent]</i><br/>
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers<br/>
Never realized the precious time them bitch niggas is wasting<br/>
Institutionalize, my bitches bring me product by the bundles<br/>
Hustle hard from the cell, G-Unit motherfucker, WE BALLING<br/>
Catch me counting trees when I'm calling<br/>
Can you set my car, Ceo let me sip on Henessy, "Can I sips some more?"<br/>
Hell, I done been in jail, I ain't scared<br/>
Momma checking in my bedroom, I ain't there<br/>
I got a head with no screws in it<br/>
Motherfuckers think they can stop 50... they losing it<br/>
Lil' nigga named Ja, thinks he live like me<br/>
Talking about he left the hospital, took 9 like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent]</i><br/>
You living fantasies nigga<br/>
I'll Reject your Deposit<br/>
When yo lil sweet ass coming out of the closet<br/>
now he wondering why DMX blow him out<br/>
next time grown folks talking bitch close your mouth<br/>
Peep me I take this war shit deeply<br/>
Seen too many real niggas balling like these bitch niggas beat me<br/>
yous a motherfucking punk and you see me with gloves<br/>
quit scaring them fucking kids with ya ugly ass mug<br/>
and you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want<br/>
but you and i know whats going on Nigga pay back I know your bitch ass from way back<br/>
Witness be strap with macs You know I don't play that<br/>
All these old rappers trying to advance its all over now -- take it like a man<br/>
HAHA--Irv looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick<br/>
trying to play hate on my shit - man eat a fat dick<br/>
Loving this shit, thats how you made me-feeling like I got you niggas crazy, i like<br/>
Against all odds up with my dogs motherfuckers now<br/>
It'll be the realist shit I ever wrote<br/>
Against all odds, up in the studio getting blow to the truest shit i ever<br/>
spoke 21 gun salute<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Hey yo I'm one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core<br/>
Hey Jeffrey, What the fuck you come involving me for?<br/>
You spent a long time coming like a bless and a check<br/>
you see 106 and park fans don't even fucking respect you<br/>
It's kinda funny, wanna be PAC wanna be fake like he thug<br/>
running around talking shit that he ain't even capable of<br/>
now let me OFF this cock sucker watch me handle you nigga<br/>
If i recall Violator use to manage you nigga then took a closer look and<br/>
realized you was an empostor theres never been a Violator on a Murda Inc rosta. Dumb ass<br/>
now who shoot? -- Ah made you look, you said Busta singing the same old hook, You Stupid<br/>
if yall shoot I take a look at ya man the bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam<br/>
Chedda Bob ass nigga start adjusting ya plan<br/>
you let the streets down nigga - Apologize to ya fans<br/>
watch ya pull a lil stunt like we ain't know where you are ya lil faggot<br/>
desperate be trying while we establish a buzz I know the shit is driving you crazy You wondering how<br/>
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice what you gonna do now?<br/>
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefing with you<br/>
I think about the game and what its like and "WHAT WOULD IT BE WITHOUT YOU"<br/>
You finished I ain't trying to repeat this just because I'm cool shouldn't<br/>
take my kindness for weakness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta speaking in background]</i><br/>
Ooh shit ha ha That was fun Next time you got a problem with me, Address me<br/>
before you try to make the shit a public issue homie, I'm return back to my regular<br/>
self and have fun again<br/>
