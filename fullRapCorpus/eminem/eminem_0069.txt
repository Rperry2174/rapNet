<i>[Intro - Spoken:]</i><br/>
Yo, I can't sing but<br/>
I feel like singin'<br/>
I wanna fuckin' sing<br/>
'Cause I'm happy<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm happy<br/>
Ha Ha<br/>
I got my baby back<br/>
Yo, check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Sung:]</i><br/>
Some days I sit starin' out the window<br/>
Watchin' this world pass me by<br/>
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for<br/>
I almost break down and cry<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think I'm crazy<br/>
I'm crazy, oh, so crazy<br/>
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time?<br/>
<br/>
But then I see my baby<br/>
Suddenly I'm not crazy<br/>
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders<br/>
Everyone's leanin' on me<br/>
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over<br/>
But then she comes back to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Sung:]</i><br/>
My baby girl <i>[Hailie laughs]</i> keeps gettin' older<br/>
I watch her grow up with pride<br/>
People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me<br/>
They just don't see my real side<br/>
<br/>
I act like shit don't phase me,<br/>
Inside it drives me crazy<br/>
My insecurities could eat me alive<br/>
<br/>
But then I see my baby<br/>
Suddenly I'm not crazy<br/>
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders<br/>
Everyone's leanin' on me<br/>
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over<br/>
But then she comes back to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Rapped:]</i><br/>
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter<br/>
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father<br/>
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her<br/>
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't <i>[*want her* backwards]</i><br/>
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona<br/>
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his mama,<br/>
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest<br/>
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,<br/>
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow<br/>
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold<br/>
And this load is like the weight of the world<br/>
And I think my neck is breaking.<br/>
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?<br/>
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,<br/>
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell<br/>
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt<br/>
So many chances, man, it's too bad, could've had someone else<br/>
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted<br/>
So here's what I'm facin':<br/>
3 felonies, 6 years of probation<br/>
I've went to jail for this woman,<br/>
I've been to bat for this woman<br/>
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman<br/>
Man, I should've seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?<br/>
Would've ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'<br/>
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more<br/>
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie<br/>
So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya<br/>
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner<br/>
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted<br/>
It's like the greatest gift you can get<br/>
The weight has been lifted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders<br/>
Everyone's leanin' on me<br/>
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier<br/>
Nothin' can take her from me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Spoken:]</i><br/>
Woo!<br/>
I told you I can't sing<br/>
Oh well, I tried<br/>
Hailie, 'member when I said<br/>
If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?<br/>
Guess what?<br/>
Daddy's here<br/>
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby<br/>
I love you! <i>[*kiss*]</i>
