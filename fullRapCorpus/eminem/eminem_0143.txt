Oh, my goodness What have I done (oh no) I can't believe it<br/>
It's like... I've got the whole world<br/>
In my palm And I'm ready to drop bombs...<br/>
Welcome to the slim shady mecca Rebecca<br/>
It's the village in new york right next to the try decca<br/>
It's my sector homosexual dissector<br/>
Come again rewind selector<br/>
I said nice rectum I had a vasectomy hector<br/>
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually reck ya<br/>
Hannibal Lector into guy sex and I bet ya I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya<br/>
They said once bitten n twice shy<br/>
We lie next to the guy<br/>
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra<br/>
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir I took the rest of the lunester pills from my dresser<br/>
It's my kinda vibe what else shud I try lester<br/>
Drop, kick the bitch before the second trimester<br/>
Performed a home abortion with dexter the (ni yeser)<br/>
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How shud I begin it and were does it all end The world is just my medicine ball your all in<br/>
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How shud I begin it and were does it all end My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends<br/>
<br/>
All my west side bitches throw it up Put a balloon inside your pussy... queef and blow it up<br/>
Man I think that he just fell off the teeth and showing up<br/>
So you better change the station<br/>
To keep from throwing up Man you seen it all before your all too familiar with it<br/>
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it<br/>
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't I won right by the pussy cat dolls when call you kitten<br/>
I'll pee on rihanna see man I do what I wanna<br/>
Spray perfume in the sauna room<br/>
crazy glue in Madonna to The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her<br/>
Imagine if visual for that man Who would've thoughta<br/>
Could ever be such a relentless prick<br/>
And leashin his fingers  For the chicks who waltz<br/>
She looks like she outlived her life sentence I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive<br/>
If you (were(nt)) so defensive it wouldn't be<br/>
Your so sensitive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How shud I begin it and were does it all end<br/>
The world is just my medicine ball your all in<br/>
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Lets begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How shud I begin it and were does it all end<br/>
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends<br/>

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand<br/>
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quick sand<br/>
Here you need a hand... big man... grab hold of this branch<br/>
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man<br/>
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words... jeeze<br/>
So one last time, mister Christopher reeves Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please<br/>
(Christopher Reeves) Eminem I'm coming to kill you (sniff)<br/>
Always hated you and I still do You'll never feel my shoes<br/>
My superman costume (sniff)<br/>
Doesn't even fit you they don't feel you  You taking this shit too far (sniff)<br/>
Who d'you think you are (hang) my suit up in the armoire<br/>
Everyday I hate you more and more Throw down the cardboard<br/>
Lets break dance if you think your hardcore<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's time for you to hate me again Lets begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How shud I begin it and were does it all end The world is just my medicine ball your all in<br/>
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Lets begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How shud I begin it and were does it all end<br/>
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends
