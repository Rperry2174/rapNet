<i>[Verse 1 - Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care<br/>
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care<br/>
You can be black, white or a albino yeah<br/>
You can have corn rows inside your hair<br/>
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare<br/>
This bottle of wine goes upside your head<br/>
A little bit psycho, but I know that<br/>
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it<br/>
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag<br/>
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad<br/>
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit<br/>
You can just keep making them tired old threats<br/>
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah<br/>
See me, but don't dare to try no shit<br/>
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers<br/>
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass<br/>
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast<br/>
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah<br/>
From outta nowhere, you might find your career<br/>
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care<br/>
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)<br/>
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)<br/>
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but<br/>
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want<br/>
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice<br/>
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight<br/>
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit<br/>
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it<br/>
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit<br/>
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it<br/>
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'<br/>
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'<br/>
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm<br/>
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim<br/>
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire<br/>
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'<br/>
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah<br/>
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars<br/>
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her<br/>
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!<br/>
So full of joy, boy am I absurd<br/>
Even Chingy would tell you<br/>
'Yea boi don't curr'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care<br/>
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)<br/>
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)<br/>
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - 50 Cent]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care<br/>
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there<br/>
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair<br/>
Ya friend should've know not to front round here<br/>
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear<br/>
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here<br/>
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear<br/>
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where<br/>
A beautiful day, without drama is rare<br/>
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share<br/>
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare<br/>
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player<br/>
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor<br/>
riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying<br/>
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying<br/>
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Eminem]</i><br/>
<br/>
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care<br/>
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)<br/>
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)<br/>
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)<br/>
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)
