I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America<br/>
And to the Republic for which it stands<br/>
One nation under God<br/>
Indivisible with liberty and justice for all...<br/>
It feels so good to be back..<br/>
<br/>
I scrutinize every word, memorize every line<br/>
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind<br/>
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind<br/>
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time<br/>
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as<br/>
I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass<br/>
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask<br/>
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past<br/>
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has<br/>
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task<br/>
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft<br/>
Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts<br/>
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half<br/>
Of his career typical manure moving past that<br/>
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act<br/>
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness<br/>
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed<br/>
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength<br/>
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong<br/>
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog<br/>
To the light at the end of the tunnel<br/>
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march<br/>
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh<br/>
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)<br/>
<br/>
All the people up top on the side and the middle<br/>
Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little<br/>
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back<br/>
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black<br/>
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together<br/>
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather<br/>
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better<br/>
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever<br/>
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go<br/>
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know<br/>
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us<br/>
Mosh pits outside the oval office<br/>
Someone's tryina tell us something,<br/>
Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible<br/>
For this monster, this coward,<br/>
That we have empowered<br/>
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'<br/>
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists<br/>
Now this is our final hour<br/>
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice<br/>
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise<br/>
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six...<br/>
Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch<br/>
Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech<br/>
Let the president answer a higher anarchy<br/>
Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war<br/>
Let him impress daddy that way<br/>
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil<br/>
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal<br/>
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero<br/>
Look in his eyes its all lies<br/>
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped<br/>
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die<br/>
If I get sniped tonight you know why,<br/>
Cause I told you to fight.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
And as we proceed,<br/>
To Mosh through this desert storm,<br/>
In these closing statements, if they should argue<br/>
Let us beg to differ<br/>
As we set aside our differences<br/>
And assemble our own army<br/>
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction<br/>
That we call our President, for the present<br/>
And Mosh for the future of our next generation<br/>
To speak and be heard<br/>
Mr. President, Mr. Senator<br/>
Do you guy's hear us...hear us...<i>[laughing]</i> (Hailie)
