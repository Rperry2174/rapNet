<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Huh, so I'm out the game huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Yo Dre, we riding?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Whatever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Well I'm with you homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
OK, let's handle this small shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I was born to brew up storms 'n stir up shit<br/>
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit<br/>
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit<br/>
Corrupt and I'm pour it on like syrup, bitch<br/>
Thick in gritz, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth<br/>
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth<br/>
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth<br/>
And if I fumble the verse, keep going<br/>
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it<br/>
No punches, pull no punches, that's weak shit<br/>
Fake shit if I ever take shit, I eat shit<br/>
Wasn't for him? I wouldn't be shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane<br/>
Been here longer than anyone in the game<br/>
And I ain't got to lie about my age<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
But what about Jermaine?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name<br/>
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your saying<br/>
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked<br/>
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it<br/>
Ya midget, Mini-Me, with a bunch of little Mini-You's<br/>
Running around your backyard swimming pools<br/>
Over 80 million records sold<br/>
And I ain't have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause what you say is what you say<br/>
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it<br/>
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it<br/>
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh?<br/>
<br/>
Cause what you say is what you say<br/>
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it<br/>
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it<br/>
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Second verse, it gets worse<br/>
It gets no better than this<br/>
Amateurs drink veteran piss<br/>
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up<br/>
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri<br/>
Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you<br/>
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucking again<br/>
Dre ain't having it as long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
If there was some magic shit I could wave<br/>
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone<br/>
And bury to make sure the tradition carries on<br/>
I would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
If I could only use this power for good<br/>
I wouldn't, not even if I could<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
From the hood and I'm a hornet<br/>
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
And I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warning<br/>
And swing to knock somebody's fucking head off<br/>
Cause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off<br/>
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk<br/>
Don't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk<br/>
When I was little I knew I would blow up<br/>
And sell a mil or grow up to be Attila<br/>
Go nuts and be a killer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
And I'm something of a phenom<br/>
One puff of the chron<br/>
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again<br/>
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer<br/>
So come along with us (Come On)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause what you say is what you say<br/>
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it<br/>
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it<br/>
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh?<br/>
<br/>
Cause what you say is what you say<br/>
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it<br/>
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it<br/>
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Now anybody who knows Dre<br/>
Knows I'm about fast cars and alize, partying all day<br/>
But I handle my business cause it's work before play<br/>
Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet<br/>
However you want it, you could have it your way<br/>
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day<br/>
Bullet with your name, sending it your way<br/>
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway<br/>
Cause this is my space, you invade it<br/>
Live to regret it and you die trying to violate it<br/>
Fuck around and you'll get annihilated<br/>
Eyes dilated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Ha, like my old lady<br/>
Cause what you say is what you say<br/>
Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things<br/>
Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things<br/>
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything<br/>
Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back<br/>
I speed write and my loose leaves my launch pad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
And I can pull any string<br/>
Don't have to prove anything<br/>
Catch a contract on your head<br/>
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?<br/>
You better get a vest, then invest in something<br/>
To protect your head and neck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth<br/>
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth<br/>
But a lot of truth is said in jest<br/>
And if I ever do live to be a legend<br/>
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source<br/>
Ain't holdin' my fucking breath<br/>
But I suffocate for the respect<br/>
Fore I breathe to collect the fucking check<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause what you say is what you say<br/>
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it<br/>
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it<br/>
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh?<br/>
<br/>
Cause what you say is what you say<br/>
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it<br/>
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it<br/>
So who you playing with huh huh huh huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Watch your fuckin' mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland]</i><br/>
Yo this Timbaland, tell him I said suck <i>[chicka]</i> my dick
