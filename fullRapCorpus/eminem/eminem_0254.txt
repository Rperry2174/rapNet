<i>[Intro: x2]</i><br/>
I done figured this rap shit out<br/>
I map shit out strategically<br/>
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key<br/>
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly<br/>
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately<br/>
And order the mask til they want a war, don't start a war<br/>
Shit not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more<br/>
Victims to stick I'm fixin to pick some and start shit<br/>
I'm outta <i>[repeat]</i><br/>
Pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at<br/>
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff<br/>
We done beat em to death, Benzino went deaf<br/>
There seems to just be no one left to bully<br/>
Bush is pussy<br/>
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush?<br/>
Puss is bushy<br/>
Ain't shit goin on, shit I been gettin so bored lately<br/>
I'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again<br/>
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then<br/>
Shit I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look<br/>
The game just isn't the same, it's changin<br/>
Shit Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin the same shit<br/>
It's ancient, it's fakin<br/>
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language<br/>
Fubba you cubba kubba, yubba obubba uba<br/>
Yubba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba<br/>
Summaladoomalama<br/>
I'm not a human I'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber<br/>
You think I'm a nuisce, I'm impressive I'm the new Madonna<br/>
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on<br/>
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest<br/>
Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
