I sense someones tapping into my phones why do<br/>
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon<br/>
The F.B.I might be tryin to pull my file soon<br/>
I might be walking blind fold into a typhoon<br/>
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky<br/>
Right outside of the window of my living room<br/>
And if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them itunes<br/>
If I don't try to record as much before I do<br/>
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can<br/>
As I stand before you in this booth a walking deadman<br/>
Blank stare dead pan look as my face as I gaze into space<br/>
As I wait to be scooped up in that van<br/>
Mysteriously disappear into thin air<br/>
And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of no where<br/>
And I'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech<br/>
Who hid behind the freedom of speech<br/>
Tryed to take the fifth amendment use it, twist it and bend it<br/>
And ended up dying to fill out in the heros splinters (?)<br/>
The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous<br/>
In remembrance of september 11<br/>
Flash back to september 7th<br/>
When Tupac was murdered in Vegas<br/>
He said that he predicted his own death<br/>
Let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it<br/>
Like the day John F Kennedy was assasinated in broad day<br/>
By a craze lunatic with a gun<br/>
Who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository<br/>
Where the President would go for a little friday stroll<br/>
Shots fired from the grassy knoll<br/>
But they don't know or do they?<br/>
Whos they for them to say TouchÂ©<br/>
Where all vunerable and it's spooky<br/>
This is about as cookey as I've ever felt now<br/>
Count down to Nuclear Meltdown<br/>
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br/>
You can run you can do what you want to<br/>
But you know you aint gonna do nuttin<br/>
When its time its your time<br/>
You are the prime target<br/>
You have become Public Enemy Number 1
