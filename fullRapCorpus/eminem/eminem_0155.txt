<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
So this is it...<br/>
This is what I wished for<br/>
Just isn't how I envisioned it<br/>
Famed to the point of imprisonment<br/>
I just thought the shit'd be different<br/>
But something changed<br/>
The minute that I got a whiff of it<br/>
I started to inhale it<br/>
Smell it<br/>
Started sniffin' it<br/>
And it became my cocaine<br/>
I just couldn't quit<br/>
I just wanted a little bit<br/>
Then it turned me (in) to a monster<br/>
I became a hypocrite<br/>
Concert after concert<br/>
<br/>
I was raking in the dough<br/>
Rolling in green<br/>
Had the game hemmed up<br/>
Like a sewing machine<br/>
But I was losing my freedom<br/>
There was no where for me<br/>
To not go and be seen<br/>
And just go and be me<br/>
And there was no in-between<br/>
You either loved it or hate it<br/>
<br/>
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3<br/>
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it<br/>
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest<br/>
The Marshall Mathers was a classic<br/>
The Eminem Show was fantastic<br/>
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it<br/>
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet<br/>
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic<br/>
And eight years later, I'm still at it<br/>
Divorce, re-married<br/>
A felon<br/>
A father<br/>
Sleeping pill addict<br/>
And this is real talk<br/>
I feel like the Incredible Hulk<br/>
My back has been broke, and I can still walk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So be careful what you wish for<br/>
'Cause you just might get it<br/>
And if you get it then you just might not know<br/>
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just<br/>
Come back on you ten-fold<br/>
<br/>
I said<br/>
<br/>
Be careful what you wish for<br/>
'Cause you just might get it<br/>
And if you get it then you just might not know<br/>
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just<br/>
Come back on you ten-fold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I got a letter from a fan, that said<br/>
He's been praying for me<br/>
Every day and for some reason<br/>
It's been weighing on my mind heavy<br/>
'Cause I don't read every<br/>
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but<br/>
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?<br/>
You didn't pray for me when I was local<br/>
And as I lay these vocals<br/>
I think of all the shit I had to go through<br/>
Just to get to where I'm at<br/>
I've already told you at least<br/>
<br/>
A thousand times in these rhymes<br/>
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got<br/>
God on my side<br/>
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?<br/>
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint<br/>
Man, boy's got to look<br/>
Nuts<br/>
And that's the only word I can think of right now<br/>
On how<br/>
To describe the shit<br/>
This is like a vibe you get<br/>
Go ahead and bob to it<br/>
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So be careful what you wish for<br/>
'Cause you just might get it<br/>
And if you get it then you just might not know<br/>
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just<br/>
Come back on you ten-fold<br/>
<br/>
I said<br/>
<br/>
Be careful what you wish for<br/>
'Cause you just might get it<br/>
And if you get it then you just might not know<br/>
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just<br/>
Come back on you ten-fold
