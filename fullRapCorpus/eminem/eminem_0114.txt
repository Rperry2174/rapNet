<i>[Intro (Obie Trice)]</i><br/>
"Obie Trice/Real Name No Gimmicks"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
two trailer park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside<br/>
<br/>
Guess who's back, back again<br/>
Shady's back, tell a friend<br/>
Guess who's back,<br/>
guess who's back,<br/>
guess who's back,<br/>
guess who's back<br/>
guess who's back<br/>
Guess who's back...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to<br/>
see Marshall no more they want Shady I'm chopped liver<br/>
well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya<br/>
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor<br/>
some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker than a<br/>
shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating<br/>
when I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)<br/>
you waited this long now stop debating 'cause I'm back,<br/>
I'm on the rag and ovulating<br/>
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney but your husband's heart problem's complicating<br/>
So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me so let me see<br/>
they tried to shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me<br/>
So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that,<br/>
cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy<br/>
I just settled all my lawsuits<br/>
FUCK YOU, DEBBIE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x:]</i><br/>
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me<br/>
'Cause we need a little controversy,<br/>
'Cause it feels so empty without me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious<br/>
embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis<br/>
they start feeling like prisoners, helpless,<br/>
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"<br/>
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution, polluting the air waves a rebel<br/>
so just let me revel and bask, in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass<br/>
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me?<br/>
Well I'm back <i>[batman sound]</i><br/>
fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna<br/>
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter<br/>
The center of attention back for the winter<br/>
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling<br/>
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting<br/>
Testing "Attention Please"<br/>
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me<br/>
here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free<br/>
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit.<br/>
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked<br/>
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards, and Moby<br/>
you can get stomped by Obie, you 36 year old bald headed fag blow me<br/>
You don't know me, you're too old let go it's over, nobody listens to techno<br/>
Now let's go, just give me the signal I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults<br/>
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil ever since<br/>
Prince turned himself into a symbol<br/>
But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me<br/>
So this must mean I'm disgusting, but it's just me I'm just obscene<br/>
Though I'm not the first king of controversy<br/>
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley, to do Black Music so selfishly<br/>
and use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)<br/>
there's a concept that works<br/>
20 million other white rappers emerge<br/>
but no matter how many fish in the sea it'd be so empty without me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la... la la la) <i>[2x]</i><br/>
"Kids"
