Damn it feels good to be back<br/>
I'm having a relapse<br/>
<br/>
How the hell did he manage<br/>
To get more felony charges?<br/>
He's already got life in jail<br/>
Man, what the hell is his problem?<br/>
<br/>
Well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic<br/>
They compelled me<br/>
To kill this elderly man<br/>
<br/>
And i get these panic attacks<br/>
Pop a xanax, relax<br/>
Try to stick my fucking dick<br/>
Inside a mannequins ass<br/>
<br/>
Then i get manic depressed<br/>
And the orthodontist get gas masked<br/>
Kick ass<br/>
The first thing i'll put on is the mask<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of masks, man<br/>
It aint to late to have a change of pace<br/>
And take it off and show my face<br/>
So you can see the things you face<br/>
And slice you up<br/>
And cook you after your murder<br/>
By strangulation<br/>
<br/>
Thats bacon souffle<br/>
You making aint you<br/>
Well thank you jason<br/>
<br/>
There goes one more coma<br/>
Due to blunt force trauma<br/>
Just give me one more soma<br/>
And i'll be done for it mama<br/>
<br/>
Go in the damn broom closet<br/>
Another valium lost it<br/>
Shovin the vacuums nozzle<br/>
Down the bathroom faucet<br/>
<br/>
It seems like every day i get a little flakier<br/>
The medication is making my hands a little shakier<br/>
Hand me that 18 month old baby<br/>
To shake him up<br/>
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea<br/>
Breaking his neck in 80 some places<br/>
<br/>
Baby here shady comes lady<br/>
He's got the razor ba-blades and the cha-cha-chainsaw-saw baby<br/>
You b-b-blundering bumbling m-m-mumbling dumm dumms<br/>
Yeah, here i come come you hear the rumbling, vrum vrum<br/>
<br/>
Theres something inside of that blue tarp<br/>
And that drum drum<br/>
A head and torso of someone<br/>
Where'd it come from?<br/>
<br/>
Who's it belong to<br/>
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair<br/>
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms<br/>
Clearly theres some'n wrong<br/>
'Cause she didn't come home<br/>
<br/>
Shes missing<br/>
Where is she<br/>
Something fishy is going on<br/>
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody get your dance on<br/>
To my damn song<br/>
C'mon
