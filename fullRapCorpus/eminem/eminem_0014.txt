<i>[Intro: Frogg]</i><br/>
Whoa!<br/>
A get your hands in the air, and get to clapping 'em<br/>
And like, back and forth because ah<br/>
This is what you thought it wasn't<br/>
It beez the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen<br/>
I be the F-R-O the double G <i>[coughing in background]</i><br/>
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Eminem]</i><br/>
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady<br/>
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady<br/>
I'm buzzing, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer<br/>
Cursing at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer<br/>
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from<br/>
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album<br/>
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open<br/>
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then<br/>
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)<br/>
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it<br/>
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash<br/>
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass<br/>
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin<br/>
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson<br/>
The +Proof+ is in the pudding, just ask the Deshaun Holton<br/>
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
So when you see me on your block with two glocks<br/>
Screaming "Fuck the World" like Tupac<br/>
I just don't give a fuck!<br/>
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin<br/>
Telling your boys that I'm on crack<br/>
I just don't give a fuck!<br/>
So put my tape back on the rack<br/>
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack<br/>
I just don't give a fuck!<br/>
But see me on the street and duck<br/>
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed<br/>
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Eminem]</i><br/>
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Milkbone<br/>
I'm everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone<br/>
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason<br/>
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezing<br/>
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview<br/>
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review<br/>
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals<br/>
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols<br/>
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles<br/>
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)<br/>
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion<br/>
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion<br/>
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic<br/>
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict<br/>
Half animal, half man<br/>
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can<br/>
With more holes than an Afghan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Eminem]</i><br/>
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)<br/>
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against The Machine<br/>
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shooting up while this record is spinning<br/>
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion<br/>
Fuck dropping the jewel, I'm flipping the sacred treasure<br/>
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher<br/>
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches<br/>
Sick of nagging bosses bitching while I'm washing dishes<br/>
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush<br/>
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush<br/>
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed<br/>
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team<br/>
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian<br/>
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smoking weed again<br/>
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median<br/>
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Eminem]</i><br/>
Shit, fuck everything...<br/>
Outsiders, Pace One, Young Zee.<br/>
Fuck the entire world...
