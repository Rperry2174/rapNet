<i>[Chorus: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I bring the dough out<br/>
Everytime they go out, you know they bring they ho out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I bring that flow out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Trippy niggaz and a few hoes<br/>
One night, two shows<br/>
That's two mansions and a team expansion<br/>
Thumbin' through a check, got me sweatin and pantin'<br/>
When you getting money chicks start coming around<br/>
Niggaz start hatin' who's holdin' you down<br/>
All this ice I'm just livin the life<br/>
Bad bitches want me, give me head like lice<br/>
Hit club LIV in a rush<br/>
Pockets so swole I think they finna bust<br/>
Ace in my hand and a 45 tuck<br/>
Money coming down codeine pourin up<br/>
Smokin on some dope, always on a float<br/>
20 years in niggaz callin me the G.O.A.T<br/>
Money adding up you haters going broke<br/>
Still in the game while you niggaz ridin old<br/>
See me showin out they muggin I dont give a fuck<br/>
How I start my morning off a zip and a double cup<br/>
Hating ass niggaz, y'all behind me<br/>
Ball so hard they want to fine me<br/>
Juicy J, Taylor Gang<br/>
I been rich since the 90's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
All these ratchets hoes say I ain't shit<br/>
Well, at least I ain't broke ho<br/>
Stackin paper like old folks<br/>
And you still stayin with your old folks<br/>
She a fan, that's fantastic, poppin zany's, that's zantastic<br/>
Gettin rich, band-tastic, white girls like Anne Hatha-<br/>
Way going, way out, they wait for my bandwagon<br/>
She let me bang and I ain't got a bandana<br/>
Ooh (Freaky) that's just how I move<br/>
Fast girls, fast money, no more fast food<br/>
Came up first class, my passport gettin tattooed (boi)<br/>
Young ass playa doing everything that I have to<br/>
So everytime I go out...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
I got some bad bitches with me<br/>
Say they like Rihanna love Whitney<br/>
She say how many bottles do you want, I told her 50<br/>
She say anything, yeah bitch a kidney<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I bring that dough out<br/>
Finesse is on a milli, it lookin like a blowout<br/>
100 bitches with me, look like I left the ho house<br/>
100 racks with me, look like I left the blow house<br/>
Now we poppin bottles, they came with the sparkles<br/>
Got my niggaz with me, they came with them yoppers<br/>
Got a few ratchets, even a couple models<br/>
20 car caravan, I bet they gon follow, ugh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
