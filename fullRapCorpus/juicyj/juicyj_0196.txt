<i>[Intro - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
The hustle continues<br/>
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga<br/>
Yeah nigga, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Pardon me, pardon me<br/>
Hardest in your hood, you ain't shit to me<br/>
Pardon me, pardon me<br/>
I don't give a fuck who you supposed to be, nigga<br/>
Pardon me, pardon me<br/>
Niggas run they mouth, end up 20 feet<br/>
Pardon me, pardon me<br/>
You talking about that fuck nigga, put his ass to sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sold the dope, told the nigga not to hold the dope<br/>
Get the cash hit the drop, bring it back watch your ass<br/>
Niggas plotting caught you snitching, left you licking same niggas<br/>
Watch your bragging same niggas<br/>
You count your hundreds cause you fucked up now dead &amp; lonely<br/>
Broke, you fucked up now dead &amp; lonely<br/>
7 in the morning, streets is yawning<br/>
My niggas is back on the corners<br/>
My niggas is back with them choppas<br/>
That show where they jam when they clip is reloaded they blam<br/>
North nigga from the mud up to no good<br/>
Sold million records but I keep that 38 snub tuck<br/>
Ready for war, fuck nigga talking shit, let's go to war<br/>
I ain't into popping shit fuck nigga, this is the north<br/>
Mafia mothafucking 36 straight hitters out for this door<br/>
My shottas unload, we even the score<br/>
It's real as it get, don't get exposed, don't get exposed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Against all odds, back to the wall<br/>
I'm coming in for my cut like a act to the law<br/>
Gimme what you owe me, don't do me no favours<br/>
I got now, so fuck you later<br/>
The gutter done turned us all and the gladiators<br/>
Try me and get stomped, like an<br/>
Get money, everything else don't mean nothing<br/>
Price on yo head, niggas get rich, you see them comin<br/>
Them goons on the way, if I push a button<br/>
Act a fool if ya wanna, we pull up right beside ya<br/>
Semi auto at ya driver, you don't wan't this drama<br/>
We just want the money, you don't fuck with niggas like us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - G.O.D.:]</i><br/>
Pardon me, shit ain't hard to me<br/>
I done have to beef with niggas thas across the street<br/>
Pardon me, shit ain't hard to see<br/>
You won't find another nigga that is as hard as me<br/>
Pardon me, just might park to see<br/>
Multiply all my hunnids, I'm a double G<br/>
Nigga I be on the bullshit, number twenty-three<br/>
Let me demonstrate a murder to the first degree<br/>
Catch you posted on the corner, open for the three<br/>
Think fast, chest press, that assist for me<br/>
Let sing to em like the symphony<br/>
Rock a bye lullaby, put his ass to sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
