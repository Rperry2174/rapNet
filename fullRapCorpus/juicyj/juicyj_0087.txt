<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Show up with them bags, full of them bands<br/>
High on alert, I'm high as a kite<br/>
Hoes on the couch, my niggas faded<br/>
This shit is crazy, I'm bout to set off in this bitch<br/>
Hollywood hills, the money is real<br/>
Coke in your nose, table of blow<br/>
10 car garage, nowhere to park<br/>
Ratchet bitches love to walk<br/>
Fine ratchet bitches, tall light skin with red hair<br/>
Gucci slippers, <i>[?]</i> they wear pad<br/>
We fuck get high like Lenny and Yoko Ono<br/>
Will I remember you tommorow, that's something I don't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Smoked out, dabbed out, all my homies passed out <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Smoked out, leaned out, living with them <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm on the dab slumped up<br/>
I'm on the dab throwing up<br/>
I'm on the dab all these bitches<br/>
I'm on the dab smoked out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
20 racks, blowing bands<br/>
First class, big planes<br/>
Fly ho, from Instagram<br/>
What you know, been a fan<br/>
You all in the gram, you blowing it up<br/>
I came in her mouth, I'm throwing it out<br/>
What did you think, I'm worth 20 mill<br/>
Hollywood hills, the money is real<br/>
Xanax and liquor all in my system<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
All of my niggas is dabbed out bout to shut this shit down<br/>
Fire alarm, the neighbors is hating, the neighbors is hating<br/>
I offered her liquor, she offered me shrooms<br/>
I'm fucked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
