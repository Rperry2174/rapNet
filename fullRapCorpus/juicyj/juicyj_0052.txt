Federal authority say it works like this. Drugs are moved in bulk across the Mexican border to hub cities like Atlanta where it's broken down in warehouses, shipped to other cities, then broken down again where it's sold on the street. The cash goes back to the hub cities where it's packged and shipped down to cartel members in Mexico.<br/>

Cocaine Is a hell of a drug (hell of a drug)<br/>
Mix it cool, keep a hell of a pluck (hell of a pluck)<br/>
Back up the truck, put the drugs on the fore cliff (fore cliff)<br/>
I'm a show you bitch niggas how we do this<br/>
<br/>
You got the fish scale, I got the cash (I got the cash)<br/>
Let's wap it out (wap it out), let's do it fast (do it fast)<br/>
You got the fish scale, I got the cash (I got the cash)<br/>
Let's wap it out (wap it out), let's do it fast (do it fast)<br/>

I was riding with connecter girl, on my way to Georgia<br/>
Brother meetin' with this nigga for some keys out of Florida<br/>
I'm ridin' with this fool, I ain't known this nigga by two months<br/>
He talkin' on his cell, speakin' in Spanish, I'm like oh fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spanish]</i><br/>
What's that nigga sayin'?<br/>
<i>[Spanish]</i><br/>
Man, I ain't playin'<br/>
<i>[Spanish]</i><br/>
Here we go again<br/>
<i>[Spanish]</i><br/>
I'm a do him here<br/>
<br/>
I pull a 44 from my drawers, then I started blastin'<br/>
I hear him in the neck, he started shaking, he was gagging<br/>
I shot him in the head, then I took his body to a ditch<br/>
I respect the dead but I disrespect the suttup snitch<br/>
<br/>
Cocaine Is a hell of a drug (hell of a drug)<br/>

I'm still ridin' down to Georgia, mane I hustle for the money<br/>
This nigga tried to set me up, they had to give him something<br/>
I'da murk my connect, tell you what's next<br/>
Somebody gon get smoked like cigarettes<br/>
Cause I'm never slippin' kept my old rusty 10<br/>
Underneath the seat for a cold blooded mess<br/>
Just before I knew I saw a undercover van<br/>
Life's fresh and crazy, I'm like "holy shit"<br/>
Get your ass off the cars, get your ass on the ground<br/>
I knew somebody saw me dump the body, I can't go down<br/>
I said get your ass off the cars and get your ass on the ground<br/>
I'm surrounded by five force cars, this the end now<br/>
<br/>
We believe the suspect has just shot himself in the head. Blackmail, blood all over the windows, can't really see inside. Send an ambulance to 46 and I-20. Man was in a white rental truck, fired one of them drug runners again.
