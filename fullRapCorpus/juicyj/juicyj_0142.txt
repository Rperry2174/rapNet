Don't you know I got beans in my lean<br/>
I go green, I sip all Act<br/>
I don't want no red if it ain't Act, then don't call back<br/>
What you know about Act? What you know about Act?<br/>
What you know about Act? I know all about that<br/>
<br/>
Pour me up a 4 and some more, I need all that<br/>
You ain't never drank like this before, nigga fall back<br/>
What you know about Act? What you know about Act?<br/>
What you know about Act? I know all about that<br/>
<br/>
Oh you say you got that work, oh you got some syrup<br/>
Oh you say you got some bird, that'll you murked<br/>
Oh you say it's for a stack, I'm a call you back<br/>
Cause that shit-a get you wacked, if that shit ain't Act<br/>
Load the drug up then I told my niggas get the fuck up<br/>
Nigga hit me up like he the plug, got me fucked up<br/>
Say that shit real but if it's fake, he getting fucked up<br/>
If that shit real my nigga then we done loved her<br/>
If that shit real, we charging them niggas 6 a deuce<br/>
I'm pouring up a 4 and I need 'em so don't forget the juice<br/>
Undercut the competition, charge them niggas 62<br/>
Sell a hunnid pints of that shit then go get you 62's<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know I got beans in my lean<br/>

<br/>
I pull up on this nigga, he was nervous<br/>
Nigga so scary, I'm suprised that nigga <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm a come and get it, that's that front door service<br/>
But I'm picky to myself that I should murk 'em<br/>
My nigga like hold him, give him a chance<br/>
He made us come all the way for his bands<br/>
Plus I'm tweaking and geeking off all these xans<br/>
Here he come right now, he walking to the van<br/>
He like always Juicy J and he a fan<br/>
I sipped it it real slow as I shook his hand<br/>
I'm like fuck all that groupie shit, you the man<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know I got beans in my lean<br/>
I go green, I sip all Act<br/>
I don't want no <i>[?]</i> if it ain't Act, <i>[?]</i><br/>
What you know about Act? What you know about Act?<br/>
What you know about Act? I know all about that<br/>
<br/>
Pour me up a 4 and some more, I need all that<br/>
You ain't never drank like this before, nigga fall back<br/>
What you know about Act? What you know about Act?<br/>
What you know about Act? I know all about that
