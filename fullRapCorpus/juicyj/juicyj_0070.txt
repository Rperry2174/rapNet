<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down<br/>
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud<br/>
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down<br/>
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Smokin' gas in a rental<br/>
She givin' me mental<br/>
Countin faces (countin faces)<br/>
While she poppin molly like mentos<br/>
I got money forreal tho<br/>
Split blunts down the middle<br/>
I got love for everybody, who give a fuck how you feel though<br/>
In a big house with 10 hoes<br/>
Catch me in the hills blowin endo<br/>
Pool party, that's indoors<br/>
So much gin, take a swim ho<br/>
Homie pass the weed, let's get super high<br/>
I smoke that shit that made R. Kelly think that he could fly<br/>
Droppin racks off one plate<br/>
Took her to the strip then blew it<br/>
Took a lot of gin and some pills, took her to my hotel room like screw it<br/>
Smokin on pounds, smokin on pounds<br/>
In Seattle where ain't no crime<br/>
All I do is smoke weed and rhyme<br/>
Sip codeine just to eaze my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down<br/>
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud<br/>
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down<br/>
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Chugging on lean and I'm chiefin on skunk<br/>
With yo man girl and I eat like it's lunch<br/>
Kick it so tough you would think I roll pine<br/>
Niggas so high you would think I'm gon jump<br/>
Upwards and down, it's just like a sea saw<br/>
Her titties keep bouncing just like a beach ball<br/>
She oh want em all to be smoking, we fuckin<br/>
On so many drugs that we can't sleep at all<br/>
Goons on my side, I got cars I don't drive<br/>
Got a bitch in my bed that's somebody's broad<br/>
Got kush in my blunt, got lean in my Sprite<br/>
I'm drunk as a fish and I'm high as a kite<br/>
Two down bitches and I'm in the middle<br/>
Maybach and my curtains I ain't got to the rental<br/>
I stay low, I look only in em<br/>
That's the killa loudpack in my cigarillo<br/>
No Reggie in my presence, tell them niggas get it right<br/>
I got girls doing girls now that's the shit I like<br/>
Now that's the shit I love, give me pussy money drugs<br/>
I take 30 out my stash then go blow it with my plug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down<br/>
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud<br/>
Don't pass me no regular, I'm a turn it down<br/>
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm a turn it down, and be turnt up<br/>
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up
