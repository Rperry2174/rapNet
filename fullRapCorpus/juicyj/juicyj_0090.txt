<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
(I don't wanna do it to 'em)<br/>
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money<br/>
Now-now-now I got to get you<br/>
(But I got to do it to 'em)<br/>
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money<br/>
Now-now-now I got to get you<br/>
(I don't wanna do it to 'em)<br/>
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money<br/>
Now-now-now I got to get you<br/>
(But I got to do it to 'em)<br/>
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money<br/>
Now-now-now I got to get you<br/>
(I don't wanna do it to 'em)<br/>
<br/>
That's my nigga, that's my dog<br/>
Ran off with my money, now I got to do my dog<br/>
That shit broke my heart, we done been through it all<br/>
Why a nigga got to play foul, all I want to do is ball<br/>
I can't call up my goons, handle this shit myself<br/>
And I'm on a whole lot of drugs, I'm just trying to ease this stress<br/>
This nigga like my brother, how he gon' cross that line<br/>
How a nigga gon' play me, got to be out his mind<br/>
Knowing where we come from, can't just let that shit go<br/>
Used to be my charge partner, back in the day when we kicked doors<br/>
Throwing crosses, now I gotta off him, but damn, that's my nigga<br/>
Now I got to do my nigga, why it got to be my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
You can't be playing with the paper, homie<br/>
You gon' have me duct taping your baby mama<br/>
Kidnapping kids, cutting fingers off<br/>
Don't make me hunt you down, cause I'm a gun you down when I see you, dog<br/>
Juicy J ain't no joke, no conversation, just gun smoke<br/>
And we don't care what time it is, show's over, drum roll<br/>
Ain't nowhere you can hide, fool, hide your ass when I find you<br/>
Catch your ass at that Mickey D's, murk your ass in that drive-thru<br/>
You know what I'm 'bout, nigga, chopper under my couch pillow<br/>
Them young niggas you sending out all got to go down with you<br/>
The options now, I got to pop 'em, but damn, that's my nigga<br/>
Now I gotta do my nigga, why it got to be my nigga<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Elle Varner:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I'm a get you, get you<br/>
I'm<br/>
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you<br/>
One way or another, I'm gonna find you<br/>
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you<br/>
One way or another, I'm gonna find you<br/>
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you<br/>
One way, yes<br/>
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you<br/>
One way, hey<br/>
Hey, I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you<br/>
One way or another<br/>
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you<br/>
One way or another, I'm gonna find you<br/>
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you
