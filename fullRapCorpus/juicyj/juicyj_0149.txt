Man when these niggas get under pressure, they will snitch on you I don't give a fuck if you've been knowing these niggas all your life<br/>
Y'all grew up... that shit don't mean shit<br/>
Niggas ain't real mane<br/>
<br/>
These niggas screaming all that real shit, but under pressure niggas fold<br/>
You niggas some hoes mhm<br/>
You niggas screaming all that killa shit but under pressure niggas fold mm<br/>
You niggas some hoes they some hoes<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they snitching<br/>

Tell some, they telling<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they snitching<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they telling<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Oh we know you told you done sold your soul<br/>
Working with the devil for that pot of gold<br/>
Say you on parole, got em for the low<br/>
I should have my little nigga come through and kick ya door<br/>
You the type to tell, cause you scared as hell<br/>
That I used to have a choppa on me and a scale<br/>
See I got a couple partners waiting on they bail<br/>
That'll knock the meat up out your taco with these shells<br/>
See we ain't on that hoe shit, tell em we don't know shit<br/>
Yo name all up in that paperwork you couldn't hold it<br/>
See these niggas just like lawn chairs they just keep on folding<br/>
Keep talking how them niggas hit you up and keep on rolling<br/>
<br/>
These niggas screaming all that real shit, but under pressure niggas fold<br/>
You niggas some hoes mhm<br/>
You niggas screaming all that killa shit but under pressure niggas fold mm<br/>
You niggas some hoes they some hoes<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they snitching<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they telling<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they snitching<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they telling<br/>
<br/>
Word round town you doing a whole lot of talking<br/>
Nigga you ain't heard? You gon wake up in a coffin<br/>
Word round town you doing a whole lot of snitching<br/>
Nigga you ain't heard? You gon wake up in one of them ditches<br/>
Leave em missing in the river we call that sending em fishing<br/>
Got a couple dirty bitches in my kitchen doing dishes<br/>
Make a couple hunnit thou, leave a lil bit for my misses<br/>
Tell that bitch don't do no talking you just sit back and just listen<br/>
I can show you how to get that bag and show you how to flip it<br/>
Pay attention to the game, they would die for the way we living<br/>
You can't even have a nigga round on a mission<br/>
Niggas snitching on they own, got to stay up out of prison<br/>
Damn!<br/>
<br/>
These niggas screaming all that real shit, but under pressure niggas fold<br/>
You niggas some hoes mhm<br/>
You niggas screaming all that killa shit but under pressure niggas fold mm<br/>
You niggas some hoes they some hoes<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they snitching<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they telling<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they snitching<br/>
You the type to tell some<br/>
Tell some, they telling<br/>

<i>[Juicy J and DJ Blak:]</i><br/>
I'm telling you mane, you gotta watch these niggas mane. I'm telling you bruh, they ain't who they say they is<br/>
Or who they claim to be<br/>
You gotta trust yourself man, you wanna do anything, get something done, just do it yourself fuck a nigga<br/>
They talking too much<br/>
It's so simple, stop snitching, stop lying, stop being a bitch out there man<br/>
All you gotta do is stay in your lane<br/>
DJ Blak, Juicy J. Rules of the game are simple baby<br/>
Fix your face my nigga, if you don't know what I'm talking bout
