You better get familiar with the sound, baby<br/>
This what happen when you win the Oscar's<br/>
They make 'em sing for you<br/>
Juicy J, DJ Blak<br/>
It's the conexion, baby<br/>
<br/>
I'm still working while I'm on vacation<br/>
You can't tell me nothing by my dedication<br/>
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my medication<br/>
Feet up in my whip cause it's very<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hold up, hold up<br/>
I told you with no mistake<br/>
Ain't no missunderstanding<br/>
Juicy J, DJ Blak<br/>
Yeah, we here, baby<br/>
O's to Oscars<br/>
Who the fuck would ever thought we would win a Oscar in here?<br/>
<br/>
I'm still working while I'm on vacation<br/>
You can't tell me nothing by my dedication<br/>
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my medication<br/>
Feet up in my whip cause it's very spacious<br/>
All these niggas nervous, what the fuck is pressure?<br/>
You not on this level cause you lack the effort<br/>
You thought you seen the drought, you 'bout to see a desert<br/>
Getting to this money is my guilty pleasure<br/>
I should take a break and let 'em get a chance<br/>
Fuck that shit, I'm turnt up in this bitch again<br/>
Bitch I ain't your daddy, I can't hold your hands<br/>
One thing that's for sure is bands gon' make her dance<br/>
Play this at your party, play this on your block<br/>
Yeah play this at your office, play this in your shop<br/>
Play this when you and the homies load the Glock's<br/>
Play that shit again when my album drops<br/>
My business gets personal<br/>
Forgive me for birthing you<br/>
I heard a couple lines that you stole from a verse or 2<br/>
My flow is too versatile<br/>
My punchlines get surgical<br/>
'Fore I even heard of you, already murdered you<br/>
Hard work pays off, so bitch you know what to do<br/>
Lock myself down in the trap for 'bout a month or 2<br/>
I got work, so you know that client√®le is coming through<br/>
We got grams, we got grammy's, we got O's and Oscar's too<br/>
She wanna hop in the Range, I wanna hop in the Wraith<br/>
She wanna all in the pants, I wanna all in her face<br/>
All I be wanted is bands, all I be wanted is base<br/>
I don't wanna be no friends, bitch get the fuck out my face<br/>
She fell in love in a day, I fell in love with the yay<br/>
I fell in love with the cake, ain't got time to go spray<br/>
Had to make sure we was straight<br/>
I was the reason we ate, I put the food on your plate<br/>
You should just let me degrade<br/>
Have a melon or a grape, all these niggas full of hate<br/>
I'm so high, need a cape<br/>
I'm so high, I'm in outer space<br/>
My safe is running out of space cause I be spreading to the cake<br/>
Like I'm tryna win a race, your bitch is all up in my face<br/>
Tell us we got good taste, cause all I know is first place<br/>
Who is the one that was telling you niggas 'bout cooking and whipping the yay<br/>
All of these bitches be on me when I'm in the Bentley, what more can I say?<br/>
Bitch I been kicking this paper since pimping <i>[?]</i> way back in the day<br/>
Real niggas getting this money so fuck you little bloggers and fuck what you say
