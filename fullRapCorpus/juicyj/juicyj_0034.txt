These niggers dropping dimes, they some real snitches<br/>
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches<br/>
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause<br/>
All that pouring and that talking ain’t allowed where I’m from <i>[X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nigger stuck off in the fare, fucking with them bricks<br/>
His partners put them laws on him, over a bitch<br/>
These pussy nigger scared, don’t wanna take they charge<br/>
They swear they hard but they softer then cotton balls<br/>
Real niggers go to jail and don’t tell them nothing, true<br/>
Do that time, come back home then get back to hustling<br/>
We got everything for sale, but the kitchen sink<br/>
Keep my eyes on you snakes, I don’t even blink<br/>
Boy you scared, you gonna tell them white folks everything, yes sir<br/>
To cut your time, you gonna give up errybody name<br/>
Snitching nigger you ain’t straight, them folks gonna find you dead<br/>
Cut your tongue out your mouth then put one in your head<br/>
<br/>
These niggers dropping dimes, they some real snitches<br/>
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches<br/>
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause<br/>
All that pouring and that talking ain’t allowed where I’m from <i>[X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
The bigger the gun, the bigger the slug<br/>
The bigger the hole for doc to plug,<br/>
Hole in your head, I put you to sleep<br/>
Body not found, mama gon’ weep<br/>
Droppin the dime, an runnin your mouth<br/>
Nowhere to run down in the south<br/>
<i>[?]</i> goons and <i>[?]</i><br/>
I <i>[?]</i> your wig<br/>
<i>[?]</i> blowing on kush and sipping on hen<br/>
Forgive me father for your sin<br/>
<i>[?]</i> convicted felon back in the pen<br/>
<i>[?]</i> he looking for bread, he know that’s a loss<br/>
<i>[?]</i> behind them bars, now you gon’ squeal <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
These niggers dropping dimes, they some real snitches<br/>
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches<br/>
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause<br/>
All that pouring and that talking ain’t allowed where I’m from <i>[X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Prime time snitching lies, got line twistin guys<br/>
Take the clic to make them flake no bind side in district 9<br/>
Trying to dodge prison time, all die for fishin by, smith and 9's, pow pow pow,<br/>
If you mention mine one put you in a scope, two clack then it's smoke,<br/>
three scoop you up and put yo body in an envelope,<br/>
4 send yo folks jus ya head chest guts now you leakin body stinkin up the Fed Ex truck,<br/>
and that fed pressure, makes the snitches wanna roast you,<br/>
they start droppin dimes like they coins miss the toll booth,<br/>
God as my witness man i swear to tell the whole truth,<br/>
where I'm from we gets it done and act like we don't know dude<br/>
<br/>
These niggers dropping dimes, they some real snitches<br/>
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches<br/>
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause<br/>
All that pouring and that talking ain’t allowed where I’m from <i>[X2]</i>
