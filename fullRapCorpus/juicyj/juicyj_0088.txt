<i>[Common:]</i><br/>
I realize, I am the hopeful black woman who was denied her right to vote<br/>
I am the caring white supporter killed on the front lines of freedom<br/>
I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand, but instead was given a bullet<br/>
I am the two fallen police officers murdered in the line of duty<br/>
We look to the future and we want to create a better world<br/>
Now is the time to change the world<br/>
<br/>
God bless America, home of the brave<br/>
We ain't picking cotton no more but we're still slaves<br/>
They talk about peace, but how that's gon' be<br/>
When police leaving young niggas dead in the street<br/>
When niggas start shooting back, how they gon' act<br/>
And they wonder why a nigga stay strapped<br/>
They wonder why we trap, for real, real niggas don't rat<br/>
Black man, born with a target on his back<br/>
Standing with his hands up, screaming "Don't shoot!"<br/>
Biggest gang in America, the boys in blue<br/>
Now we gon' ride, now we gon' loot<br/>
Cause that black man could have been me or you<br/>
<br/>
Don't shoot!<br/>
Don't shoot!<br/>
Don't shoot!<br/>
Don't shoot!<br/>
Don't shoot!<br/>
<br/>
Fuck the police, like Cube &amp; Eazy-E<br/>
A nigga pay taxes and still ain't free<br/>
We just trying to get rich and ball out<br/>
Looks like the pigs trying to take us all out<br/>
We don't get justice, we just get handcuffed<br/>
They don't want to see a nigga get his bands up<br/>
Crooked judge just handing out sentences<br/>
Cause we're guilty until proven innocent<br/>
Standing with our hands up, screaming "Don't shoot!"<br/>
Biggest gang in America, the boys in blue<br/>
Damn right we gon' ride and we gon' loot<br/>
Cause that black man could have been close to you
