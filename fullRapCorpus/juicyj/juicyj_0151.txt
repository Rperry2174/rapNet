Yo TM<br/>
Play me some pimpin' mane<br/>
Anybody got an old school out there mane<br/>
Rev that shit up<br/>
<br/>
Ok I'm old school riding<br/>
Tinted like I'm hiding<br/>
Four fifty four in the trunk when I'm sliding<br/>
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent<br/>
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em<br/>
<br/>
Ok I'm old school riding<br/>
Tinted like I'm hiding<br/>
Four fifty four in the trunk when I'm sliding<br/>
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent<br/>
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em<br/>
<br/>
Ok I did it all in one day<br/>
Pulled up on that one way<br/>
Still a hood nigga, pullin' bitches off the runway<br/>
Had to take these niggas straight to church like a Sunday<br/>
Please don't run up on me cause my youngin's 'bout that gun play<br/>
And niggas get murdered in my city for them old schools<br/>
Nigga pull you right up out your shit like they 'posed to<br/>
So don't let 'em catch your ass lacking like I told you<br/>
Niggas treat your ass like a chair, they'll fold you<br/>
Pinky ring hanging out the window, looking like a lick<br/>
Step up out the whip all white, looking like a brick<br/>
Wood grain gripping, that's the K, I'm riding with the stick<br/>
Diamonds in my mouth, that's a karat every time I spit<br/>
<br/>
Ok I'm old school riding<br/>
Tinted like I'm hiding<br/>
Four fifty four in the trunk when I'm sliding<br/>
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent<br/>
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em<br/>
<br/>
Ok I'm old school riding<br/>
Tinted like I'm hiding<br/>
Four fifty four in the trunk when I'm sliding<br/>
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent<br/>
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em<br/>
<br/>
Ok it's 3 in the morning, naw I ain't yawning<br/>
Hopped up in the old school, I just jumped out the foreign<br/>
A zip what I'm rolling and an eight what I'm pouring<br/>
Wanna fuck me in her car, she say her nigga boring<br/>
8's on the feet, I just call that shit the high life<br/>
Wanna see me do that shit again, that's a highlight<br/>
Don't ask me why I smoke this Mary J cause this is my life<br/>
Weed so many different colors call it tie-die<br/>
Smoking on the good stuff, fillin' up my lungs<br/>
Sippin' on that dirty dirty 'til a nigga numb<br/>
Know some niggas that'll come and get ya for the fun<br/>
I'm ridin' dirty, fuck a thirty, bitch I got a drum<br/>
<br/>
Ok I'm old school riding<br/>
Tinted like I'm hiding<br/>
Four fifty four in the trunk when I'm sliding<br/>
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent<br/>
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em<br/>
<br/>
Ok I'm old school riding<br/>
Tinted like I'm hiding<br/>
Four fifty four in the trunk when I'm sliding<br/>
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent<br/>
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em<br/>
<br/>
That beat harder than a motherfucker TM
