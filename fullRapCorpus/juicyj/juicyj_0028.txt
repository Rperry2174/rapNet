<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I keep a lot of heat, like Pat Riley<br/>
Got them tools for your body parts, like O'Reilly<br/>
I ain't joking nigga, my name ain't Rickey Smiley<br/>
Fall up in the club, and we start wilding<br/>
I keep a lot of heat, like Pat Riley<br/>
Got them tools for your body parts, like O'Reilly<br/>
I ain't joking nigga, my name ain't Rickey Smiley<br/>
Fall up in the club, and we start wilding<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
These niggas out here snitching, they with the Rat Pack<br/>
Hit 'em with the chopper that's the rat trap<br/>
Find 'em in a trash bag off the interstate<br/>
House full of gangster niggas never renovate<br/>
You snitching you deserve to die, bloody murder<br/>
Hating on another nigga cause his trap twerking<br/>
Oh you mad cause he fucked your bitch, boy you a ho<br/>
What the fuck do you expect, a ho gone be a ho<br/>
And your ho is a pro, fuck every nigga she know<br/>
You love her dirty drawers so you can't let her go<br/>
You out here chasing pussy, you should be chasing commas<br/>
I'll cut your fingers off, and mail them to your momma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Banana clip is guaranteed to knock you down<br/>
Niggas talking loud, 'till I come around<br/>
(Pussies, what they talking 'bout)... not a sound<br/>
Thought he was living life, 'till he met the ground<br/>
AK-47, that's my gun walk<br/>
I don't run my mouth, I let the gun talk<br/>
I'm in love with this Nina can't you see it ho<br/>
She got a body on her so I had to let her go<br/>
I'm bout to start a riot<br/>
I'm on a money diet<br/>
I'm from the Mafia ho, so I wouldn't try it<br/>
He was screaming, crying<br/>
So I didn't buy it<br/>
Let the pistol sing to the nigga, like Mariah<br/>
<br/>
