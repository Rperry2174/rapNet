<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Come and get some money accept a invitation<br/>
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me<br/>
Come and get some money accept a invitation<br/>
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me<br/>
<br/>
Come and get some money accept a invitation<br/>
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me<br/>
Come and get some money accept a invitation<br/>
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me<br/>
<br/>
I'm a mafia nigga I got white friends<br/>
Blacked out smoked out in that white Benz<br/>
Still go hard til the night ends<br/>
My niggas on the blocks like tight ends<br/>
You niggas ain't street never move along<br/>
Can't go to the club, Get followed home<br/>
Your niggas might change when they under pressure<br/>
When the feds come and get em answer every question<br/>
Its some niggas in yo clique that'll start hatin<br/>
When you flying up the charts makin top paper<br/>
And these thirsty ass bitches wanna have your baby<br/>
An these fuck niggas wanna try to assassinate ya<br/>
G. ass nigga yeah I bought my crown owner<br/>
Doe B the only nigga that can look down on me<br/>
Catch a nigga while he sleep<br/>
Whip him with the heater to his head<br/>
With the pistol then drag him out the bed<br/>
I have to keep in mind this rap game is like the trap<br/>
And keep your eyes on them niggas actin like they got your back<br/>
I know what I'm talkin' bout I'm speakin the truth<br/>
It is what it is<br/>
<br/>
Come and get some money accept a invitation<br/>
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me<br/>
Come and get some money accept a invitation<br/>
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me<br/>
Come and get some money accept a invitation<br/>
You just talk a lot of shit but shit don't impress me<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Don't be running up on me talking that shit<br/>
Don't be round me not smoking no dope<br/>
Don't be round me not spending no cash<br/>
Don't be<br/>
Nigga don't be a hater<br/>
Don't think about it now just do it big<br/>
Really wanna do it big then jump in my whip<br/>
Nothin but real ones in my clique<br/>
They be dumpin' them clips, they be all on them trips<br/>
They be mobbin for chips, and we all got a zip<br/>
Got six joints already rolled<br/>
I done broke too many phones<br/>
I done fucked too many hoes<br/>
And we all got a zip<br/>
Got six joints already rolled<br/>
I done broke too many phones<br/>
I done fucked too many hoes<br/>
(Your bitch said she wasn't gonna smoke no more)<br/>

<i>[Project Pat:]</i><br/>
187 maybe hell maybe heaven<br/>
Blowed off sawed off dirty mac 11<br/>
Bust one unforgiven fast life I be livin'<br/>
Young nigga pay attention know its life in prision<br/>
Masked up flagged up<br/>
Nigga had his back turned, chopper shot his back up<br/>
Get his ass clapped up<br/>
Strippers famous<br/>
Always got smoke comin' out the chamber<br/>
Lames be in the wrong place at the wrong time<br/>
Talkin' about bad about me young niggas fine<br/>
Say you gonna rob me young nigga heard him<br/>
Got love for pat, young nigga served him<br/>
Used to cop from a old head so he curbed him<br/>
Got flat turned rat he murked him<br/>
These niggas play games like a killer<br/>
Weak ass nigga be bitch ass nigga<br/>
Real nigga like pat get money<br/>
Say to hell with these bitches fuck honey<br/>
I'm a get bread I'm a stack change<br/>
Nigga get wrong I'm a blow his brain<br/>
Straight to kingdom come my nigga<br/>
Round here we ride foreign my nigga<br/>
Round here bodies be storin' my nigga<br/>
<br/>
