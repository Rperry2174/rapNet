Bitch, get up Bitch!<br/>
Suck a niggr dick bitch<br/>
Yeah, hoe<br/>
<br/>
They wanna know what I'm worth<br/>
Tell em I'm 50, tell em I'm an animal<br/>
I got the shit out the dirt<br/>
Fuck your lil turf<br/>
I won, the heir<br/>
So get out the way or get hurt<br/>
You know that money come first<br/>
And I got used to the thirst<br/>
I'm trynna teach you a lesson<br/>
I'm trynna come with some blessings<br/>
They come with no curse<br/>
I hope you're ready for war<br/>
I never seen one that didn't come with a hearse<br/>
Even my bitches be ready<br/>
They riding around with one in their purse<br/>
How did they get to this?<br/>
Lemme tell you again that I'm filthy rich<br/>
I done seen it and done it and done it again<br/>
You watching and talking and hoping and wishing<br/>
I'm living it<br/>
There, we just making it rain<br/>
I hit them bitches with bands (bands, bands, bands)<br/>
I make a bitch wanna dance<br/>
I wanna give her a chance (chance, chance, chance)<br/>
I make a bitch wanna make me her plan<br/>
I make a bitch wanna make me her man<br/>
I be too busy, don't focus on paper<br/>
And block them shots that be coming from haters<br/>
Did a song with Katy Perry<br/>
Bank account looking very<br/>
Very, very, very scary<br/>
To these other rappers, don't compare me<br/>
To these other rappers I'm the blue print<br/>
Like Jay-Z, or 9 eleven<br/>
She didn't really believe I live in paradise<br/>
Till she walked in and seen heaven<br/>
My niggrs been through hell<br/>
Let us out them cells<br/>
On the block you really can't major in<br/>
Nothing else but sales<br/>
And this might give you chills<br/>
The police got them cameras on em<br/>
My people still getting killed<br/>
So I gotta choppa and I got a pump<br/>
I eat your dinner and I eat your lunch<br/>
You looking for seconds<br/>
I'm coming for thirds, ain't no competition<br/>
Cause I eat em up, niggr!<br/>
And I still ain't finished cause that ain't enough<br/>
They say they want action, I'm calling it bluff<br/>
My niggrs bout action, I'm calling em up<br/>
You in the league but no, you not balling like me<br/>
I'm something like MVP<br/>
Started with nothing, was down on my last<br/>
Then I got off my ass, now I'm up on my feet<br/>
I've been up for like a week<br/>
Segregated from the sleep<br/>
Segregated from the weak<br/>
Meditating with the peace, niggr!<br/>
And I ain't nothing but at peace<br/>
They thought it was over, I'm back in this bitch<br/>
And these niggrs deceased, yeah they dead!<br/>
That's what happens when coming for me<br/>
Ain't no lacking<br/>
I'm packing I'm stacking these racks up in that brand new louis V<br/>
I got bands, bands, bands on me<br/>
Now she wanna dance, dance, dance on me<br/>
Got zanz, zanz, zanz on me<br/>
Now she wanna put her friend hands on me<br/>
Yeah, that sound good, we don't need a plan B<br/>
Every given day, a hundred bands on me<br/>
A G for the G's these days sounds cheap<br/>
Two hundred fifty thou, we just had a slow week<br/>
(Mafia) (and we will never stop doing this shit, get used to it)<br/>
Ay, my niggr, for booking shows<br/>
First of all you wanna book a show<br/>
You gotta hit that Mother fucking bag<br/>
Hit up my niggr Ray at 901 292 O 7 95<br/>
I'm high as a motherfucker, you know what I'm saying<br/>
Oh yeah man, my niggr, you know, go check out my weed<br/>
Green suicide, at your local dispensaries, right now go<br/>
And get that shit man, green suicide is soul fire<br/>
I'm telling you my niggr, shit crazy
