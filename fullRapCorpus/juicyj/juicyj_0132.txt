<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
She in love with the dope, nigga<br/>
I ain't got no love for no hoe, nigga<br/>
She in love with the gold, nigga<br/>
I ain't got no love for no gold digger<br/>
Hundred bottles in the club, our goal nigga<br/>
I'd be with the thirst with the cold killers<br/>
Say you know that plug, I'm like soul nigga<br/>
Still got them drugs in the flow nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I got plot on the drinks, I got money in the bank<br/>
I can put some niggas on you like piranhas in the tape<br/>
All these thirsty bitches I heard like piranhas in the tape<br/>
All these bitches out here hoeing are regardless what you think<br/>
Go the hardest in the bank, I buy hard and you can't<br/>
Fuck that bitch like no tomorrow, she gon' swallow like a drink<br/>
She gon' chase you with the balls and the miley on her sing<br/>
I'm a star, I'm a shine like the diamonds in my lane<br/>
Chillin' with my feet up, gotta keep my heat up<br/>
Call her meet, I meet her, she must want that pussy beat up<br/>
I know how to treat her, swear I switch the switcher<br/>
Smoke her like fajitas, hit her and then delete her (delete her)<br/>
<br/>

I ain't got no love for no hoe, nigga<br/>
She in love with the gold, nigga<br/>
I ain't got no love for no gold digger<br/>

I'd be with the thirst with the cold killers<br/>
Say you know that plug, I'm like soul nigga<br/>
Still got them drugs in the flow nigga<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Bitch, you're a bitch<br/>
Ricky P said you was talking that shit<br/>
How you're a hoe when you ain't rich?<br/>
Need to open your mouth up and eat a dick<br/>
Niggas paying for pussy fucking up the gang<br/>
Say they're players but they're squares, you're so fucking lame<br/>
Stop saying you're a pimp when you're tricking nigga<br/>
You ain't a pimp, you're just simp<br/>
Took her out the street, you put new shoes on her feet<br/>
She gon' fuck another rapper, she gon' fuck an athlete<br/>
You could turn her into a wife, but she still gon' be a freak<br/>
It's young Khalifa man, now just practice what I preach<br/>
Bitch, I ain't paying them!<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Okay, this for all my niggas, got a dope case<br/>
Don't play, police tap your phone looking for hoze<br/>
Okay, they even got some pics of all our Rose<br/>
No way you never would've thought it would be your day<br/>
Okay, what about that hoe? She thirsty<br/>
No way, never trust these hoes, it ain't the old days<br/>
No way, I don't get no fuck about no hoe say<br/>
No way, she ain't good for nothing but some foreplay<br/>
Ahh ahh, should've never let her see no foe-way<br/>
Tell that bitch what she wanna hear, that's the old way<br/>
Shouldn't have let her see the crib, she won't go away<br/>
Fuck that bitch and replace her, that's a throwaway<br/>
<br/>
