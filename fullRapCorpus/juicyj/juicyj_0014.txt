<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
My goons smoke weed, My goons smell blow<br/>
My goons make moves, They pulling <i>[?]</i><br/>
If you ain't from my hood, Then you gonna have to go<br/>
You'll get your ass murked, I hope you niggas know<br/>
Throwing signs, popping nines we get violated<br/>
<br/>
20 deep when we ride we get violated<br/>
A chopper pointing at your spine we get violated<br/>
We murder niggas all the time we stay violated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
We about to ride on you lying ass niggas<br/>
You ain't selling dope, you ain't pulling triggers<br/>
You ain't get no dirt, you ain't no gorilla<br/>
You rap about somebody else life I figure<br/>
Why you saying you on them cars while you leasing<br/>
Just keep it real man, who the fuck you pleasing?<br/>
I know them stripper hoes keep your pump greasing<br/>
They sit up in your face, I guess they give you reason<br/>
To pay some bills, buy pills, get 'em high, you ain't real<br/>
Mr.Fly yo packing steel because that false flagging should have got you killed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We don't recognize real, you say your a trapper<br/>
You say your a gangster<br/>
I know your a actor<br/>
You ain't got no swagger<br/>
You ain't but no laughter<br/>
We stay 20 deep with gorillas and jackers<br/>
Haters still dissing, but your probably wishing<br/>
We off in the club, <i>[?]</i><br/>
Smoking on some real good, that'll make you feel good<br/>
When we passing by you, all you smell is purple kush<br/>
And we got all that shit you ain't got<br/>
Plugs for them drugs that shit you ain't got<br/>
A couple of hitmen that'll wipe you off the map<br/>
You ain't never gangbanged, and you never work the trap nigga<br/>
<br/>
