<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Don't know no English<br/>
Don't know no English<br/>
<br/>
Party today 'til tomorrow, 'til we don't know no English<br/>
Models, talkin' to models, and they don't know no English<br/>
Took that bitch out of state, where they don't know no English<br/>
My nigga just got back from the case, cause he smoked on no English<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
(Travis Scott, niggas out here talking that Brokanese, mane<br/>
We don't understand none of that shit)<br/>
A nigga been wildin' all night, mixin' that dark with the light<br/>
Fuck around, took a nigga bitch, now a nigga wanna start a fight<br/>
Nigga wanna take me out the zone<br/>
Workin' out, that's strong<br/>
I told a chick, hop in the whip<br/>
Let me know if she wanna let me hit it before I make it home<br/>
And shawty ain't nothin' but a freak<br/>
She been poppin' that pussy all week<br/>
She wanna let me hit in the backseat<br/>
It don't matter if she a freak in the streets, my sheets<br/>
She don't even know what I mean<br/>
When I say she gotta do it for the team<br/>
Lean lean, won't do it for the Gram, she'll do it for the green<br/>
Nah mean? Ching ching!<br/>
My broad don't speak no English<br/>
And my weed is Jamaican<br/>
In Miami with Haitians, my shooters got no patience<br/>
I just got me two ladies, they get high and get naked<br/>
Shoot it all in their faces, swear to God this shit crazy<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
My nigga got caught with the birds<br/>
Bet the nigga never say a word<br/>
He was like, "no habla Ingl√©s"<br/>
Nigga, I don't give a fuck what you heard<br/>
I ain't gotta pay for the Act<br/>
Got a chick in the back of the pharmacy with the syrup<br/>
Bitch, I'm a vet for the check<br/>
I had these hoes lined up, like the 1st and the 3rd<br/>
I can count a 100K in day, count a mill twice, double up at night<br/>
Nigga say, "ain't got all my dope"<br/>
Nigga, better go somewhere, get it right<br/>
Bitch, you better go somwhere, get a light<br/>
Thirsty ass bitch tryna get this ice<br/>
Lame ass bitch tryna jack my Rollie<br/>
Bitch couldn't see me even on Skype<br/>
Kobe and Shaq all in my Sprite<br/>
Whisky, Champagne coming in all night<br/>
Nigga I'm good, you can't comprehend<br/>
I'm tired of givin' broke ass niggas advice<br/>
I'm on my way overseas, I'm countin' G's 'til I land<br/>
I speak money, no translator, bet the bank understand<br/>

You know it (Straight up)<br/>
Don't know no English (Straight up)<br/>
Don't know no English<br/>
Must be nice (Straight up)<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
Don't know no English
