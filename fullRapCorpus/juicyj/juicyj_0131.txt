<i>[Intro - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Time waist for no man<br/>
You gotta boss up man<br/>
It's time to stop playing around, being lazy nigga<br/>
Get up and get to the money nigga<br/>
Grind nigga<br/>
Believe in your motherfucking self nigga<br/>
Motivation bruh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Started off with nothing, now I'm bossed up<br/>
Started in the gutter now I'm bossed up<br/>
Got it out the mud now I'm flossed up<br/>
Yeah, all my niggas good, yeah they sauced up<br/>
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up<br/>
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up<br/>
I'm bossed up, you don't wanna cross us<br/>
Bossed up, all my niggas sauced up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
If you rich then you a gangsta nigga<br/>
All the tough shit, that ain't gangsta nigga<br/>
Fuck around and find you in a bodybag<br/>
I'm just tryna fill out all these moneybags<br/>
See me, I'm what a drug dealer dream about<br/>
Fucking bad bitches, backing beamers out<br/>
If niggas want some smoke we pull them steamers out<br/>
I be so damn fresh, I cashed the cleaners out<br/>
See niggas taking shots but I'm so bulletproff<br/>
I just laugh at 'em, couple Bentley coupe<br/>
I swear I be so high I gotta loose the roof<br/>
See niggas got a lackers, they know I'm the truth<br/>
See where I'm from nobody gives a fuck about you<br/>
I know rappers, I know trappers, I know real clappers<br/>
If you ain't getting money nigga then you hustle backwards<br/>
Choppers on the backseat if you want some action<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Started off with nothing, now I'm bossed up<br/>
Started in the gutter now I'm bossed up<br/>

Yeah, all my niggas good, yeah they sauced up<br/>
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up<br/>
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Bosses, I'm with bosses I don't care bout what the costs is<br/>
We ain't tryna take no losses, we don't deal with fake shit often<br/>
I ain't after go to college, taught my self and now I'm balling<br/>
Like the summer I went out to New Orleans and came back bossing<br/>
And if a nigga play me we gone toss 'em<br/>
I don't touch 'em, I just got to make call<br/>
They waiting for me to fall but that ain't bout to happen<br/>
They playing tough but they ain't saying much about the captain<br/>
My niggas bout that action<br/>
You <i>[?]</i> your bitch heard about the thing I'm packing<br/>
I don't care about no fashion, I'm a writer not a rapper<br/>
No day moving past us, niggas moving backwards<br/>
I ain't worried bout the pussy I'm just wondering where the cash is<br/>
I just do it different, I just made my cake the fastest<br/>
If a nigga tripping get a thing and then we blast it<br/>
I just rolled some weed and fucked your bitch, that's why I'm laughing<br/>
It's young Wiz, Taylor Gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>

Yeah, all my niggas good, yeah they sauced up<br/>
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up<br/>
Bossed up, nigga, I done bossed up<br/>
I'm bossed up, you don't wanna cross us<br/>
Bossed up, all my niggas sauced up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I might be that nigga that might run your label<br/>
I might be that nigga put food on your table<br/>
I might bee that nigga that you see on cable<br/>
But I'm bossed up so my young nigga might pay you<br/>
The devil working on me so I'm prayed up<br/>
Them niggas went to bed so I stayed up<br/>
How many times I gotta tell you I'm a player<br/>
King of my city, I might run for mayor<br/>
Mafia yeah that's that new mafia<br/>
Niggas see you shining so they copy ya<br/>
Now they all sitting round plotting on stopping ya<br/>
But that's when all them bodies popping up<br/>
I got a dope bitch, she be on some dope shit<br/>
Your bitch on some hoe shit, she just want the dope dick<br/>
Coke in her veins now she wanna fuck the whole clique<br/>
She gone bust it open, she say she can take the whole dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
