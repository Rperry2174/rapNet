<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Now I'm gonna tell you bout this flippin<br/>
When I ride down the strippin<br/>
Bentley rolls on these hoes<br/>
Couple months a nigga be flippin<br/>
And you always see me glistenin<br/>
Window down bumpin system<br/>
Some of these cowards out here hatin<br/>
Keep on hatin cause I aint finished<br/>
Just a nigga from the hood<br/>
Tryin to keep it to the good<br/>
Wit dem gangs run the street<br/>
And they push dem Cadillac woods<br/>
And dem fellas on parole <br/>
Tryin to keep them pockets swole<br/>
But we gotta trust dem gods <br/>
Neither one can save our soul<br/>
From these crooked ass cops<br/>
That'd be rollin down our block mane<br/>
Tryin to flip dis change <br/>
But they fuckin up my stock mane<br/>
Baby need sum shoes <br/>
And my broad need some weed<br/>
But I cant work no job<br/>
So I'm out hurr smokin weed<br/>
And I gotta keep on hustlin<br/>
Cause a nigga gotta eat<br/>
You can find me at the candy ladies<br/>
Slangin packs of P<br/>
Minimum wage five fifty <br/>
And they wonder why we deal<br/>
Why niggas always stressin<br/>
Drinkin liquor <br/>
poppin pills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Frayser Boy (Juicy J)]</i><br/>
The game aint the same, we done changed the game<br/>
Stay the fuck away from us, we dont fuck wit you ladies<br/>
The game aint the same, we done changed the game<br/>
Stay the fuck away from us, we dont fuck wit you ladies<br/>
(So I hit the dope, grab the glock, and the chrome, and the rocks)<br/>
(On yo block, in your fuckin face, hit this all off)<br/>
(So I hit the dope, grab the glock, and the chrome, and the rocks)<br/>
(On yo block, in your fuckin face, hit this all off)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Frayser Boy]</i><br/>
Nigga I dont fuck witch you<br/>
Nigga u dont fuck with me<br/>
Dogg you talk behind my back<br/>
Just because the shit you see<br/>
Man you got yo bitch ways<br/>
Glocks up in ya just like a hoe<br/>
When you mention pimpin<br/>
Best believe it<br/>
My niggas let me know<br/>
All up in my niggas face<br/>
Got my name up in yo mouth<br/>
Dont make a nigga like me<br/>
Knock yo fuckin grill out<br/>
So you best chill out<br/>
Keep everythang on the straight<br/>
Dont be smilin in my face<br/>
And when I leave dogg you hate<br/>
When I see you man we sweet<br/>
Just before the shit go<br/>
Nigga I aint fuck yo bitch <br/>
So what the fuck you hatin fo<br/>
Ol shaky ass nigga <br/>
I aint bust a fuckin grape<br/>
Wanna throw sum fuckin bows <br/>
Nigga I'll participate<br/>
Leave the brakes off yo ass<br/>
Nigga you dont think I will<br/>
If you wanna keep some peace between us you better chill<br/>
Just because I dont talk shit<br/>
Doesnt mean I wont bust heads<br/>
So dont let nobody else <br/>
Tell me bout some shit you said hoe<br/>
<br/>
