<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yeah, we high as a junt up in this motherfucker<br/>
I'm drinkin some fruit punch; that's belvedere vodka and cranberry juice<br/>
YouknowwhatI'msayin? The engineer high, everybody highhhhhhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed<br/>
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed<br/>
Drank, Drank, drank that liquor<br/>
Pop them pills, snort that P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Now I'ma go and do it like them white folk do<br/>
Get it from the dope man I.O.U<br/>
Called tootin snow but its driftin soo<br/>
Menage-Trois awww mane dats cool<br/>
Whats in the plastic? High ass dro<br/>
The hoes that fuck smoke all my dope<br/>
Now you the type of nigga, buy a hoe a rose<br/>
I'm a keep stuffin' coke up her hose<br/>
Columbian Cocktail Purie Snow<br/>
And take her to the bounce and let her throw some bows<br/>
And let her sip syrup and make her body slow<br/>
Then take her to a room, make her suck and blow<br/>
They act a damn fool with that acid mane<br/>
And put it on they tongue then they go insane<br/>
I think its kinda wild, they be out the frame<br/>
But like the commercial, this is your brain on drugs<br/>
<i>[eggs scrambling in background]</i><br/>
Whatch you know about them pill thangs<br/>
Have ya runnin' roud drinkin listerine<br/>
Doing bout a hundred cold switchin' lanes<br/>
Take a X pill then ya wanna bang<br/>
Get a little freak take her to your home<br/>
Stuck ya dick in with no rubber on<br/>
Three days later you be on the phone<br/>
Tellin' yo doctor "She Burnt Me Joe"<br/>
That's what ya get unprotected sex<br/>
Then ya took a pill called percassette<br/>
It might keep you calm, but your still a wreck<br/>
The key little shots keep ya in the mix<br/>
I know a young nigga out in Hollywood<br/>
Who said he got sprung off Dog Food<br/>
He stuck a needle in his arm Ouchie-oooo<br/>
And then it made him feel like Awwww-cool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed<br/>
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed<br/>
Drank, Drank, drank that liquor<br/>
Pop them pills, snort that P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lord Infamous]</i><br/>
Scarecrow is the dictionary table of contents of drugs<br/>
If you describe it, I could tell you what the fuck it was<br/>
Now if your getting very drowsy, you feel very down<br/>
That must be heroine, I only sniff that Funkytown<br/>
The only marijuana that The Infamous will blow<br/>
Is purple koosh and white willow or I break down that dro<br/>
Dromo tabs and percassettes, just before i get out bed<br/>
Break out the bag of blow and take about four to the head<br/>
Lord must have his medicine, plenty yellow purple syrup<br/>
Purest herb, very perved, feel superb, to the curb<br/>
Snotting up them railroad tracks, mack having a heart-attack<br/>
Take a Xanex, put it back, bitches bout to get attacked<br/>
Sometimes I may get down with the crystal methamphetamine<br/>
Niggas stay up early, I will strain my eyes on your high beams<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I stay high as fuck<br/>
Lord should take a piss test<br/>
I would melt right through the fucking cup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed<br/>
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed<br/>
Drank, Drank, drank that liquor<br/>
Pop them pills, snort that P
