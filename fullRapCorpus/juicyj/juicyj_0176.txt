<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>

<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Me and Ben Franklin cool<br/>
Yeah that's my dude<br/>
Been on him since lil faces<br/>
I got big faces too<br/>
Might bring tex back<br/>
That's how we move<br/>
My baby bro got stripes<br/>
More stripes than you<br/>
Everything bulletproof<br/>
And all you can't see through<br/>
Everything presidential<br/>
And that cost me too<br/>
When you go hard in Goyard<br/>
That's a new Mercedes coupe<br/>
Oh that's your bitch?<br/>
She been fucking me too<br/>
Your left, your right, your left<br/>
All my old hoes been in line since I left<br/>
We out the hood, we made it through<br/>
Drink good, we're faded too<br/>
My bankroll a lot of colors<br/>
But you know my favorite two<br/>
<br/>

You know I know you don't know<br/>
So help me to help you, help me to help you<br/>
'Cause all my niggas crazy and I stick with 'em<br/>
I must be crazy glue<br/>
Niggas thought I fell off, they must be crazy too<br/>
You get knocked the hell off<br/>
I must be Satan too<br/>
Ooh girl I love you so, and I preach not to love you hoes<br/>
But I really love the paper too<br/>
That army green and navy blue<br/>

<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Getting paper so long<br/>
And the paper so long<br/>
Tell them haters so long<br/>
Tell 'em they was so wrong<br/>
You be with them niggas hating<br/>
Nigga you a hater too<br/>
Nigga better get some bitches<br/>
While you at it get some paper too<br/>
Ride with the doors off<br/>
Pour up, never doze off<br/>
Just met her for the first time<br/>
She wanna take the clothes off<br/>
She been going all night<br/>
She say she love to show off<br/>
She fuck with me 'cause I'm hard<br/>
She say them niggas so soft<br/>
<br/>
