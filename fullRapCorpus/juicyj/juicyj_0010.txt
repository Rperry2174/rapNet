<i>[Verse 2: Project Pat]</i><br/>
North Memphis...<br/>
I'm swag to death, I'm fresh to life, ho<br/>
Suck weed smoke outta blunts like lipo-suction<br/>
I don't need no introduction<br/>
West Coast plug got me back in production<br/>
Fiyayaya weed, all buzz and not no seeds<br/>
True hustlas from the hood<br/>
Always on us, keep some trees<br/>
Breath cologne and I smell that kush<br/>
Gotta nigga on blast so they swear I push<br/>
That Northern Cali sell like heroin<br/>
Two p's for the eight g's, I'm tearin up<br/>
Package is open, I'm plain outta boat and<br/>
Blunts for the cloakin, now we smokin<br/>
A candy coating on my Charger<br/>
Light the blunt, let's ride my Charger<br/>
<br/>
