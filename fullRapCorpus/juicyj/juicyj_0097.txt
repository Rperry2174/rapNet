Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up<br/>
Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up<br/>
Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up<br/>
Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up<br/>
<br/>
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up<br/>
'Bout to spend a 100 on these models, tear the club up<br/>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up<br/>
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up<br/>
<br/>
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up<br/>
'Bout to spend a 100 on these models, tear the club up<br/>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up<br/>
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up<br/>
<br/>
Came from the north side, now I'm sittin' court sides, still close range with the shooters<br/>
Still sayin' fuck it, buying bucket after bucket, I don't even know why I still do it<br/>
You didn't give me bread, you can give me head, hold up baby let me show you how you really do it<br/>
I walk like a pimp and I talk like a pimp, got game but she already knew it<br/>
I gave them a chance, <i>[?]</i> couple million but they already blew it<br/>
I smoke that weed and I drank that drank, on a block and my trap house boomin'<br/>
I do it for my gangsters and I do it for the hustlers on the block tryna get somethin' movin'<br/>
I do it for my Three 6 niggas, that's Chat, that's Black, that's Paul, that's Pat<br/>
I do it for the hometown, all my niggas on now, hate to put the city on my back<br/>
Memphis taking shots now, niggas gettin' shot down, married to the semi, I'm strapped<br/>
Shit get hot now, ridin' with the top down, listen to the north nigga back<br/>
Might as well name this club after me cause I'm bout to turn it up like that<br/>
<br/>
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up<br/>
'Bout to spend a 100 on these models, tear the club up<br/>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up<br/>
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up<br/>
<br/>
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up<br/>
'Bout to spend a 100 on these models, tear the club up<br/>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up<br/>
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up<br/>
<br/>
I'ma hustle till I die, why you think I be so fly<br/>
I don't even break a sweat, promise I won't even try<br/>
30 inches off the ground, on my bitches booty round<br/>
Rolling up another doobie, I just put the other out<br/>
Bitch I got some dope that make your ass pay hide and seek<br/>
Bitch I got the fire weed, I'm the boss can't fire me<br/>
Made it through the violence, we had silencers and lots of beams<br/>
All of my niggas proud of me, all them niggas doubted me<br/>
<br/>
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up<br/>
'Bout to spend a 100 on these models, tear the club up<br/>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up<br/>
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up<br/>
<br/>
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up<br/>
'Bout to spend a 100 on these models, tear the club up<br/>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up<br/>
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up
