<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
You niggas gon have to start<br/>
Watchin your mothafuckin back<br/>
Real shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
A gun plus a mask, you do the math<br/>
All my goons know, that equals cash <i>[x3]</i><br/>
A gun plus a mask, that equals cash<br/>
So if your fucked up down to your last<br/>
A gun and a mask gon getchu cash<br/>
A gun plus a mask, you do the math<br/>
All my goons know, that equals cash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
What you know about it nigga this that goon shit<br/>
AK sweep a nigga house without a broomstick<br/>
So nigga come up of that bad, all them pistols blast<br/>
With the choppa at yo house lyin in the grass<br/>
They a rob a nigga blind if they doin bad<br/>
Duct tape around the handle they don't use a mag<br/>
So tell em where its at, don't tell em no more lies<br/>
Line yo family up against the wall, and open fire<br/>
All you trap niggas are victims, jackers gon catch you slippin<br/>
Feeling yourself, flashin this stuntin, niggas are come end up missin<br/>
You trappers gon drop off that cash, you see em out here they hurtin<br/>
They got you back its a robbery, nigga now don't make it a murder<br/>
Too late to talk when the shit hit the fan<br/>
Got choppas on deck, war drums than a band<br/>
Gun a nigga down, leave em where he stands<br/>
Highway to hell, nigga better start praying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
A gun plus a mask, you do the math<br/>
All my goons know, that equals cash <i>[x3]</i><br/>
A gun plus a mask, that equals cash<br/>
So if your fucked up down to your last<br/>
A gun and a mask gon getchu cash<br/>
A gun plus a mask, you do the math<br/>
All my goons know, that equals cash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Walk up to your house, knock on your door, and blow your ass off<br/>
Drop it off, drop it off, bitch I got a sawed-off<br/>
Bitch I got a sawed-off<br/>
Walk up to your house, knock on your door, and blow your ass off<br/>
Drop it off, drop it off, bitch I got a sawed-off<br/>
Bitch I got a sawed-off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Yelawolf]</i><br/>
They telling me Yela don't swing<br/>
Look buddy don't worry bout me<br/>
If you in my lane, you would end up in a train that's ditch with the snakes in a leeches<br/>
Gotta take a mothafucka out I get wanted cuz I never did shit but me,<br/>
Its about time that I said it, hey would I regret it we'll see (fuck that)<br/>
Yelawolf I am a loose cannon, ask David Banner how deep<br/>
I was born and raised in this shit, momma I got manners bout me<br/>
But I'll get dirty if I gotta get dirty and dead a mothafuckin piranha up in a Alabama creek<br/>
I'm hotter than you in the middle of the summer<br/>
Sitting in a sauna under the sun in a Alabama street, shit<br/>
Rockin rollin' I got noted, I'm going up yeah I'm going<br/>
But with my dreams and my people I got that poetry loaded<br/>
My soul is sold, and they sold it, sweet <i>[?]</i> they grow it<br/>
I leave that potato smoking, look bitch don't think that I'm jokin<br/>
Click, POW!
