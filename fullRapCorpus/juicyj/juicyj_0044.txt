<i>[Hook x2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Real hustlers don't sleep, we taking naps<br/>
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps<br/>
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps<br/>
On a paper chase, and you haters getting lapped<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]</i><br/>
Hood nigga, but a good dude<br/>
Good nigga, but a hood dude<br/>
(Shit) You don't know what I been through, so you don't know what I could do<br/>
They hating on me, they talk down<br/>
They talk threats, that's good news<br/>
Margiela, RAF Simons, them Rick Owens is good shoes<br/>
Getting paid, I'm in a good mood<br/>
Old school, slabs in it<br/>
Grill 24k in it, courtesy of my black dentist<br/>
Trill bitch ad-libbing, that's what I call eloquent<br/>
I'm getting brain, she sucking dick, that's what I call intelligence<br/>
Tell a fella, Tell a gent, tell a friend, and tell a friend<br/>
All I fuck is lesbians, fuck her till she celibate<br/>
White bitches love Taylor Swift, tell that bitch I'm hella swift<br/>
Hustling, everyday, with my twin and Juicy J<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]</i><br/>
Hi guys, what's up bitch? My name is Purrp<br/>
I'm fucking your bitch, and I made her squirt<br/>
I'm going to be rich, as I put in work<br/>
Shes all on my dick, as I made her squirt<br/>
Mind will get hurt, my lyrics merk<br/>
Niggas with triggas and find them in dirt<br/>
(Man) I like to flirt, I'm all in her skirt<br/>
I smash it, and pass it, and watch that bitch twerk<br/>
One day, one day, you know I'm going to become God<br/>
Of the fucking country, do what you want to<br/>
See gun play<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Juicy J]</i><br/>
You not getting money man, you already tired<br/>
I'm finna buy a private jet, bitch I'm getting flier<br/>
Juicy J the boss, ain't no way I'm getting fired<br/>
I'm on too much shit to name, ain't no way I'm getting higher<br/>
I been chasing money since a young nigga from Memphis<br/>
I see dead presidents, I think I got 6 senses<br/>
Yea we on the money train, you just rock the benches<br/>
On the purple and the yellow, call it Barney and the Simpsons<br/>
Out in Taiwan, smoking Cheech and Chong<br/>
Roll it in a cigarillo, chief it in a bong<br/>
Ask me what I'm doing, getting high and counting money<br/>
And I'm counting all day, because the money keep coming<br/>
<br/>
