You been watching this nigga waiting on him to slip<br/>
Just wanna make the light my nigga<br/>
In the building why you creeping in the black crow<br/>
Pull up to the curve my nigga<br/>
He been out here bomming and his family broke as shit<br/>
You think he give a fuck my nigga<br/>
Look in there had a nigga down the barrel of your gun<br/>
Now look into his eyes my nigga<br/>
<br/>
Will he die, will her live<br/>
Will he beg like a bitch<br/>
Or will he testify my nigga<br/>
<br/>
Will the clip jam<br/>
Guess this nigga hold it<br/>
Who go catch it first<br/>
Somebody bout to die my nigga<br/>
Fingers itching, gripping on that cap<br/>
Think am run the chains on his neck<br/>
Jesus face with the diamonds<br/>
Ice in his mouth<br/>
Fuck that nigga smile<br/>
Cause he know if you don't let the choppers fly<br/>
We know somebody go kill him on the other side<br/>
He know somebody waiting all up in his mamma house<br/>
He know somebody fucking his baby mamma now<br/>
It's time for the come up<br/>
<br/>
Nigga this it<br/>
Got 19-15 in the clip<br/>
It's up to you and God my nigga<br/>
Another day, another dollar<br/>
He's spitting on the car my nigga<br/>
Living fast fuck the law<br/>
You ain't worry bout the cops my nigga<br/>
Your last hoe call you a fag<br/>
You thought to get a job my nigga<br/>
You just bough a new bird<br/>
The last one was hot my nigga<br/>
<br/>
Everyone showing love in the streets<br/>
You will hustle everyday<br/>
Everybody knows that you the claw<br/>
You that nigga that they wanna be<br/>
But somebody waiting on you my nigga<br/>
Don't sleep<br/>
It's a black bag with a black mag<br/>
In the black crown feat<br/>
Creeping on you<br/>
But you don't give a fuck when you out in these streets<br/>
Dollars in you chain nigga your the hoods dream<br/>
Hit the corner store for some lic<br/>
See you nigga in the rear view<br/>
You close your eyes when you about to die<br/>
One of these nigga's sound like you
