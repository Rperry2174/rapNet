<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')<br/>
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)<br/>
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)<br/>
And after I finish what's in my cup<br/>
You know I'm tryna love you<br/>
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you<br/>
Okay, okay, okay, okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I just wanna shoot a movie with a chick from out the movies<br/>
With a big old ghetto booty that know how to roll a doobie<br/>
I just wanna hit the club, throw some money on the stage<br/>
I just wanna tip a stripper more dough than she ever made<br/>
More dough than she ever seen, now she see me in her dreams<br/>
All that ass, shawty bust it, how she stuff it in her jeans<br/>
Must run in her genes, I just wanna meet her momma<br/>
I just wanna smoke my presidential Juicy J Obama<br/>
Juicy J that OG, I been ballin' this whole week<br/>
Stuntin' 20 years plus, I can do this in my sleep<br/>
I just wanna fall in Onyx with a fine Georgia peach<br/>
Got that rocket in my pocket, that's that beauty and the beast<br/>
<br/>

And after I finish what's in my cup<br/>
You know I'm tryna love you<br/>
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you<br/>
Okay, okay, okay, okay<br/>

<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Legendary, love you so much it's unnecessary<br/>
Like it's always two weeks into February<br/>
You can take that shit to the cemetery, til we're dead and buried<br/>
But girl God forbid I feel too alive<br/>
Around you I got too much pride<br/>
Do we let it breathe or put a title on it?<br/>
I'm so indecisive, I'll let you decide<br/>
She like nah seem like your chakra's off<br/>
I'm like nah it's just that your top is off<br/>
And I started out wantin' to talk to you<br/>
And now all I can think about is poppin' off<br/>
Girl you're all that matters<br/>
You in bra and panties, that's all that matters<br/>
You straddled me, I started fallin' backwards<br/>
Don't worry about the phone you can call them after<br/>
Bout to take ya down<br/>
<br/>

And after I finish what's in my cup<br/>
You know I'm tryna love you<br/>
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you<br/>
Okay, okay, okay, okay
