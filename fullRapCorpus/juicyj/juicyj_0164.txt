It's alright, it's ok<br/>
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid<br/>
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
<br/>
It's alright, it's ok<br/>
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid<br/>
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
<br/>
Got my grind on, came up errway<br/>
Roll this blame up, let's flame up errday<br/>
Got a side bitch, her name is Mary Jane<br/>
Bitches look like twins, Ashley <i>[?]</i><br/>
Double <i>[?]</i> she nasty anyway<br/>
She gon' act like she classy till she see the cake<br/>
Never seen so many blue faces look at a face<br/>
Then she let me kill it<br/>
Now it's in a better place<br/>
Ain't no better feelin' than gettin' some better face<br/>
Nigga ain't no difference I just got better taste<br/>
Make another milli how I'm feelin' errday<br/>
Niggas in their feelings, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
<br/>
It's alright, it's ok<br/>
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid<br/>
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
<br/>
It's alright, it's ok<br/>
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid<br/>
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
<br/>
It's alright, it's ok<br/>
I'm gettin' cake like it's my birthday<br/>
Errday, 5 ways<br/>
Used to have split it up 9 ways<br/>
Nowadays crime pays<br/>
Niggas lookin' at you sideways<br/>
I bet they wish they would've did it my way<br/>
I'm gettin' high on the highway<br/>
You want it then you gotta go and get it, why wait?<br/>
Throw a couple dollars, watch the freaky bitches migrate<br/>
Told the bitch don't be thirsty, she might dehydrate<br/>
Bitch, everyday is my day<br/>
And I never gave a fuck about what they might think<br/>
<br/>
It's alright, it's ok<br/>
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid<br/>
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
<br/>
It's alright, it's ok<br/>
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid<br/>
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way<br/>
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way
