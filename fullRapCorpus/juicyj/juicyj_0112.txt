Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Better not tell a bitch your biz<br/>
Better not show her where you live<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Better not give that bitch no kids, better not give that bitch a break<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
<br/>
Seen her at the club with her ass all out and her titties pushed up, god damn<br/>
Met her at the bar then you took her to your crib and y'all both crashed out on them Xans<br/>
Homie it's gon' to take a miracle for that bitch to be wifey material<br/>
Nah homie that ain't what it is<br/>
You wanna get that bitch a baby, you can't be for real<br/>
You cannot be serious, can't be thinking clearly<br/>
I've been tryna get you game, don't look like you hear me<br/>
Boy that pussy just done took over your mind<br/>
Now I guess this is what they mean when they say that love is blind<br/>
<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Better not tell a bitch your biz<br/>
Better not show her where you live<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Better not give that bitch no kids, better not give that bitch a break<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
<br/>
Look what you got into, this is what y'all got into<br/>
Caught you fucking off now she busting out your windows<br/>
This was suicidal like a Lincoln Continental<br/>
She cut up all your time now you gotta drive a rental<br/>
This what you want, nigga really you on child support court spending millions on them children<br/>
I tried to warn your ass, you weren't listening<br/>
If you was, you wouldn't be in this predicament<br/>
Baby mama drama, I'm not dealing with that shit<br/>
I'm not tryna make no babies, I'm just tryna get more rich<br/>
That's her baby daddy, he on child support<br/>
Now he working 40 hours just for juvenile<br/>
<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Better not tell a bitch your biz<br/>
Better not show her where you live<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Better not give that bitch no kids, better not give that bitch a break<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)<br/>
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit<br/>
Better curve that (Bitch)
