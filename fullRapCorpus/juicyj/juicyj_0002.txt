<i>[Juicy J talking]</i><br/>
Yes sir once again it's on Juicy J featuring Project Pat<br/>
Chronicles of the Juice man, North North part 2<br/>
Raise ya thunbs up my nigg, it's on fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Project Pat]</i><br/>
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
North north in this thing and you know we runnin things<br/>
Everybody raise ya thumb, everybody show your gang<br/>
March in a cirle man, muscle up until you strain<br/>
Project Pat and Juicy J, the niggaz with them gold fangs<br/>
Yes we keep the lighted dope, and we house the freakest hoes<br/>
Then we ride to evergreen, on the block is where we post<br/>
Policeman can't stop us, I think they oughta to stop it<br/>
I'm talkin in that ghetto english, sayin fuck the mobsters<br/>
Gangsta niggas walk up in the club, high as hell because we full of drugs.<br/>
What gang you claim/ the way they were them hats<br/>
Don't get to close be careful we be strapped<br/>
We put it on the map, we keep our gezees flapped<br/>
And if you see me in the hood you better give me dap.<br/>
I'm known as a veteran, my picture should be stacked<br/>
From smokin sin to Hollywood they wild over there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Project Pat]</i><br/>
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga. <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat]</i><br/>
If ya ain't from my hood you can get the hell from round here<br/>
Cause we gon smoke hydro and we gon drink beer<br/>
It ain't no mu'hfuckin secret case we some thugs<br/>
It ain't hard, you can peep it we sellin drugs<br/>
So don't you cowards step wrong spit the west song<br/>
These automatics have ya ass singin a different song<br/>
A mega blast from these rocks, got the track jumpin'<br/>
A North Memphis nigga sell dope I'll tell you somethin'<br/>
Ya car bumpin ridin clean and you see me bold<br/>
And now you wonderin why we kickin in your back door<br/>
This ain't no suburb my nigg this the ghetto, and you gon come through<br/>
Flosin like a pretty hoe<br/>
A no no for you off, turn her on niggaz<br/>
Show some love or you will meet them chrome triggers<br/>
We smokin bud, sippin syzerp, and poppin pills you need some work<br/>
Come on through we got the best deals<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Project Pat]</i><br/>
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
I done lived in the North round the way<br/>
I done planted playa seed in the mutherfuckin bay<br/>
Hypnotize is the label that you don't wnt to hate<br/>
I done een niggaz make, I done seen niggas spray<br/>
Brothas on the same block till his hair turn gray still all about a hustle<br/>
Punchin clock no way. The police hit the block, swallow rocks throw the hate<br/>
Still on the same block the next fuckin day<br/>
Project Pat was up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat]</i><br/>
Jimmy jimmy cocoa puff you know how we roll<br/>
Niggas is gon get shot up trippn with this north<br/>
Ridin up? dog pullin up them logs<br/>
Squeeze on this trigger, empty clips then reload<br/>
If you got beef, my nigga you better bring it<br/>
The hood buck as hell, the police couldn't tame it<br/>
Inhalin palm trees something you can hang with<br/>
Hydro with red hair something I can slang trick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat to fade]</i>
