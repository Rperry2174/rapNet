<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Turn a nigga house to a cemetery<br/>
Leave'em dead in the dirt, now his ass buried<br/>
While he in his front yard that's gone be his grave<br/>
Say goodbye to the hater errbody wave<br/>
Now errbody wave, errbody wave<br/>
Say goodbye to the hater errbody wave<br/>
Errbody wave, errbody wave<br/>
Say goodbye to the hater errbody wave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I won't let a nigga play with me, like a stingy nigga<br/>
Leave your body full of dirt, you dingy nigga<br/>
Kill a nigga right there in his front yard<br/>
Body parts all over like a junk yard<br/>
Bread on his head, all I do is say when<br/>
My guys see you in the club, beat your brains in<br/>
Hope that boy got his jewelry on, they takin'<br/>
And they reaching in your pockets for them Franklins<br/>
Got so many straps, I could be a gun broker<br/>
Cuttin' snakes in the grass like a lawnmower<br/>
Hundred round drums turn his body into a puzzle<br/>
Put that gun to your face, dog, like a muzzle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
The ones that's hatin' the ones who broke, who ain't got no hustle<br/>
I got the magnums for you pussies, I ain't talking rubbers<br/>
So play games if you want, watch me end your credits<br/>
Got beef, leave your shirt, bloody red, like spaghetti<br/>
Never bought a gun for display, don't play I'm a shoot<br/>
AK, SK, turn them to alphabet soup<br/>
I keep them slugs, I'm not a coaster so fuck your mug<br/>
Got niggas out here shootin' shit up, I ain't talking drugs<br/>
Bullets wet a dirty nigga, call that making mud<br/>
Roll up on 'em, put the flame to 'em, call that smoking bud<br/>
Ain't shit changed I still lock 'em in the trunk<br/>
.45 cal, leave his ass dead drunk<br/>
<br/>
