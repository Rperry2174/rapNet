<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
Hey, I'mma visit the sky today<br/>
Hey, I'mma dance on the clouds today<br/>
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us<br/>
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us<br/>
No, nobody can be us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
I'm tryna sink in some gin<br/>
I need, I need, I need, I need, I need<br/>
And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hating on me, on me, on me, on me<br/>
But if the neighbors know my name then, then I'm doing something right<br/>
And if their mamas know my name, and if their homies know my name then<br/>
Then I'm doing something right<br/>
And if their girlfriends know my name<br/>
Just cos she loves me, don't mean she understands<br/>
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band<br/>
I love the guitars<br/>
I already know, I've seen her at my show banging out XO all day<br/>
And her friend's a freak<br/>
She can't feel her throat, she can't feel her knees<br/>
And I'm not tryna talk<br/>
And I'm not tryna walk<br/>
Just lift me out the club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd and Juicy J:]</i><br/>
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights<br/>
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights<br/>
Weed blowing, champagne poppin (champagne poppin, champagne poppin)<br/>
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin (champagne poppin, champagne poppin)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Pounds of weed, Sour D<br/>
That medical for my allergies<br/>
In the hotel with your girl<br/>
For â€˜bout a week, shootin' a shower scene<br/>
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker<br/>
Rollin' blunts in my flying saucer<br/>
Juicy J - the new skywalker, I'll put your ho in a body auction<br/>
When I'm having fun, I'm still getting paid<br/>
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid<br/>
Stay riding through the city with my twelve gauge<br/>
Hating ass niggas, get it any day<br/>
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mill<br/>
Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil<br/>
Keep snow bunnies that like popping pills<br/>
Keep a double cup, I like cracking seals<br/>
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong<br/>
Bought the loud pack now I'm in my zone<br/>
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut<br/>
Got my codeine cups, bout to drink up<br/>
If you're talking about money, we can link up<br/>
Bad red boned bitch, body inked up!<br/>
Your girlfriend coming home with me<br/>
And when she alone with me<br/>
She gonna suck dick and she don't spit<br/>
Or I'mma put that bitch back on the streets<br/>
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi<br/>
Cause their pussy is the best and they head fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd and Juicy J:]</i><br/>
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights<br/>
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights<br/>
Weed blowing, champagne poppin (champagne poppin, champagne poppin)<br/>
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin (champagne poppin, champagne poppin)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
Hey, I'mma visit the sky today<br/>
Hey, I'mma dance on the clouds today<br/>
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us<br/>
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us<br/>
No, nobody can be us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Got that<br/>
Weed blowing, champagne poppin (champagne poppin, champagne poppin)<br/>
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin (champagne poppin, champagne poppin)
