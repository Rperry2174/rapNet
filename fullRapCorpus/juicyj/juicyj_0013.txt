<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Ghost dope, ghost dope, them Feds coming cut throat<br/>
Ghost dope, ghost dope, them Feds coming cut throat<br/>
You didn't catch me with no blow and I don't own no triple beams<br/>
And how you gonna charge me for some dope<br/>
That I ain't touched or that I ain't seen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I knew a thug that had a plug straight outta South Memphis<br/>
But he a drug habit, he couldn't stop sniffing<br/>
I had my goons meet him, ready to buy 'bout 20 bricks<br/>
Bring the summer time, ooh, I'm 'bout to make a lick<br/>
Just like always man we had to check the dope<br/>
And he said, "It's all good, man you know we folks"<br/>
One of my goons called "J man this nigga tripping<br/>
I see about 50 pillows but the other 5 missing<br/>
And this nigga nose draining like a waterfall<br/>
I'm 'bout to get what I can get and make his heart pause"<br/>
Just before I can get this nigga to calm down<br/>
I hear a "Freeze" and some shooting in the background<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
This shit was on the news, the Feds busted all my goons<br/>
The nigga with the plug habit working with them fools<br/>
Packing all my shit I heard some knocks at my front door<br/>
"Come out with your hands up", so now I'm on the floor<br/>
It's about to go down, they kicked the doors down<br/>
Guns at my head, U.S. Marshals all around<br/>
Tearing up my place, nothing never was found<br/>
It's in the shotgun house, somewhere in Orange Mound<br/>
Interrogation they kept asking me my tele-code<br/>
If I don't tell 'em nothing I'll get life with no parole<br/>
But I don't snitch, hope you niggas know the business<br/>
The wire taps is what they got but no witness<br/>
<br/>
