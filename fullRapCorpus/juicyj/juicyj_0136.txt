<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
They say money make you change up<br/>
Fuck it then, I'm tryina change up<br/>
Yeah, I'm tryina get my change up<br/>
Bitch, I'm just tryina fuck the game up<br/>
(Woah) You think I worked this hard to stay the same?<br/>
(Uh) You think I worked this hard to stay the same?<br/>
(Uh) You think I worked this hard to stay the same?<br/>
Hell no, boy, I'm tryina fuck the game up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Started from the bottom, then I came up<br/>
Niggas still broken tryna' blame us<br/>
I'd be on fire, they just flame up<br/>
You can never understand where I came from<br/>
Uh, you think I worked this hard to stay the same?<br/>
Hell no, we'd be in the thangs switching lane to lane<br/>
Bitch, you're still broken, I am the one to blame?<br/>
Do your thing, just don't hate the player, nigga hate the game<br/>
Woah, woah, I work to esteem, to a beamer, pretty motto bitch<br/>
Pussy wet as Aquafina<br/>
I got things I used to dream of, everything a little cleaner<br/>
Every time a nigga see me, I'm in something new<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Started off broke, now I'm a change up<br/>
Nigga you ain't nothing, you are stranger<br/>
Seen you in the club upon the lame stuff<br/>
Probably cause your chick gave the thang up<br/>
Anywhere I'm at, get my gang up<br/>
You'd be in the cuff with your chains at<br/>
You'd be in the snitches giving names up<br/>
I ain't in the diss, so I came look<br/>
Can't touch, can't fake<br/>
Never met a chick that I can't take<br/>
Never had a patience, so I can't wait<br/>
Never been a hater, so I can't hate<br/>
<br/>

You think I worked this hard to stay the same?<br/>
You think I worked this hard to stay the same?<br/>
Hell no, boy, I'm tryna fuck the game up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Broke bitches all in my business<br/>
Only thing worse is a bunch of broke niggas<br/>
You know how niggas get it when a nigga ain't getting it?<br/>
What's the use of making money if a nigga can't spend it?<br/>
I got broke bitches all in my business<br/>
Only thing worse is a bunch of broke niggas<br/>
You know how niggas get it when a nigga ain't gettin' it?<br/>
What's the use of making money if a nigga can't spend it?
