I wanna dedicate this song to that special chick<br/>
(Did you hear that?)<br/>
Trippy chick...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
When we go walking in the woods<br/>
Nobody can hear us<br/>
And you could be as freaky as you should<br/>
I love you at your weirdest<br/>
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call<br/>
I want you to be fearless<br/>
When we go walking in the woods<br/>
A natural experience<br/>
Go ahead...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Hey baby let's fly away to a private place<br/>
So far away we get high and feel that we out of space<br/>
She keep looking back at it, we keep grinding like jack rabbits<br/>
All she want is this pipe, I turn her into a crack addict<br/>
Ain't nothing that a nigga can't afford<br/>
Louie, Gucci or Chanel, I'll buy the store<br/>
You and me on a new beach, sippin' champagne<br/>
Making love on a island resort<br/>
No need to pack luggage, hop on the jet like "fuck it"<br/>
I got everything you want and you need, I guarantee you'll love it<br/>
She the baddest woman you ever seen, she belong with King Magazine<br/>
You might seen her on a movie screen, she's so dope now I'm her fiend<br/>
Just thinking about her I don't need a buzz<br/>
We party hard, we don't need a club<br/>
Bring your passport we're making love in Persia on a Persian rug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
When we go walking in the woods<br/>
Nobody can hear us<br/>
And you could be as freaky as you should<br/>
I love you at your weirdest<br/>
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call<br/>
I want you to be fearless<br/>
When we go walking in the woods<br/>
A natural experience<br/>
Go ahead...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I got a Rolls-Royce baby that's yours<br/>
I got a private jet baby that's yours<br/>
I'm balling baby, what's mine is yours<br/>
You can have all that and even more<br/>
I got a black card, go on a shopping spree<br/>
I buy you so much ice, girl you can ski<br/>
Your old man tryna lock you down<br/>
Come with Juicy J and you'll be free<br/>
She got her own, she independent<br/>
We at the lake, she skinny dipping<br/>
In the hotel we wake the neighbors<br/>
They knocking like Jehovah's Witness<br/>
Girl we can kick every chop karate<br/>
Out on my yaught we go island shopping<br/>
Back to my suit, ten grand a night<br/>
Just me and you, it's a private party<br/>
She's sent from heaven, mayne<br/>
She needs wings on her<br/>
I might have to put a ring on her<br/>
Damn she so bad, damn she so thick<br/>
I wonder how she fit jeans on it<br/>
For me she unleash her inner animal when we meet<br/>
And she a lady off in the streets<br/>
But a beast when we're in the sheets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
When we go walking in the woods<br/>
Nobody can hear us<br/>
And you could be as freaky as you should<br/>
I love you at your weirdest<br/>
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call<br/>
I want you to be fearless<br/>
When we go walking in the woods<br/>
A natural experience<br/>
Go ahead...
