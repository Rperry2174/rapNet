<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C:]</i><br/>
Light green, northern lights, gettin' sucked into midnight<br/>
Blue Jag, white Range, candy car, kryptonite<br/>
I be proin', I keep these bitches hoeing<br/>
Want a date? Straight-up pimp<br/>
If you want some, you can find me in the H-Town<br/>
Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the ki<br/>
And bitch, my dick was never free<br/>
Didn't know if I wanted to rap or sell coke<br/>
Cause niggas like me ain't never broke<br/>
I traded in my Pyrex for a shiny Rolex<br/>
The bitches want sex, but all I'm fuckin' with is checks<br/>
I'm smokin' out, pouring up, whippin' my DeVille<br/>
Took out the air bag, put in a wood wheel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I've got rocks in my watch, I've got mud in my Sprite<br/>
I'm ridin' low key, and I'm high as a kite<br/>
Juicy that nigga, you niggas gon' learn<br/>
This ice on my neck gave me freezer burn<br/>
I'm not goin' broke like MC Hammer<br/>
Still blowin' money like birthday candles<br/>
Your bitch in my whip and she's gone off the mollies<br/>
My eyes be Chinese and my doors know karate<br/>
Bitch, I'm so rich and you know what I like<br/>
Some drugs, couple of bitches that dyke<br/>
One of them hoes that I'm fuckin' just might be your wife<br/>
Take her then give her this pipe, rollin' papers, we blazin' up<br/>
Take a chick out shopping, she wanna fuck<br/>
Wanna speak to me? You don't make enough<br/>
Get your money right, stop saving these sluts<br/>
Hit single and a world tour, fuck you mean?<br/>
That's more cream<br/>
In a hotel, on the top floor gettin' more head than oil sheen<br/>
Nigga feelin' like Rambo, got a fully automatic in my Lambo'<br/>
Rich nigga still country like a banjo<br/>
Shoot a nigga 'til I run out of ammo<br/>
And I've got an R&amp;B chick 'bout to get fucked silly<br/>
I'm trippy, she trippy, showtime, let's get it<br/>
White girls with a ass fat like skinnies<br/>
Group sex on tour, every night a new city<br/>
In the club with my Louis bag<br/>
You know that bitch got dope in it<br/>
My credit card like Silkk The Shocker<br/>
Black card with no limit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
You know, all the time I'm on the grind<br/>
Sucker, better get fuck shit off your mind<br/>
The.45 gon' keep fuck boys in line<br/>
I run up on 'em, tell 'em "separate yours from mine"<br/>
They way behind and I'm way ahead<br/>
Ridin' with a bitch gettin' major head<br/>
She like: "Damn, homeboy, we ain't made it yet?"<br/>
I'm like: "Not if you ain't swallowed these babies yet"<br/>
Okay, everywhere that I go out, I'm walkin' in and I show out<br/>
And man, all the dough that I throw out<br/>
Is sure to turn these lil' hoes out<br/>
These bitches already knowin' that everywhere that I'm goin'<br/>
I'm in a fast car that cost a quarter-mill<br/>
And I'm ridin' it like it's stolen<br/>
Hustle Gang, gangrene, in God we trust<br/>
Anybody gettin' money is down with us<br/>
"Fuck you" to the nigga who was talkin' tough<br/>
But not because you talkin', cause you broke as fuck<br/>
That shit contagious, they probably hatin'<br/>
I shop at Neimans, you shop at Macy's<br/>
Yo J's dirty, I paid 30<br/>
For a one-way trip on a plane Thursday<br/>
Hope lames heard me, got cash in hand<br/>
50 grand all wrapped in elastic bands<br/>
Nigga wanna be the man, I'm past the man<br/>
Fuck with me, they will never see your ass again<br/>
I'll turn your ass to a rocket, to the moon you go<br/>
Like some shit that you done seen on cartoons before<br/>
You can't hide nowhere my goons won't go<br/>
Turnt up last night, finna do it once more, aye<br/>
<br/>
