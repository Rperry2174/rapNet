<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Security fucked up let me bring the zippy in<br/>
You bitch missing we both missing we both disappear<br/>
If I pull up in that Phantom she gon' disappear<br/>
If I pull up in a Phantom we gon' disappear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Swae Lee &amp; Slim Jimmy x2:]</i><br/>
She's drunk already<br/>
I'm lit already<br/>
What you mean roll up<br/>
What you mean burn up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Let's talk money shit I'm rich already<br/>
Let's get freaky baby call me Robert Kelly<br/>
I'm at <i>[?]</i> watching bitches shake their jelly<br/>
Weed and Liquor make her look like Halle Berry<br/>
I'm lit don't worry no panties<br/>
Let them kids stay with their granny<br/>
This dick you about to swallow save that fuck shit for your marriage<br/>
Ho I'm Juicy J, to fuck me is a dream<br/>
Ziploc full of trees hypnotize your mind then I leave<br/>
Money over hoes by any means, mean<br/>
Eight hundred thousand in jewelry I got Egyptian needs<br/>
Grab my Phantom keys, pour me a little lean<br/>
You niggas out here saving thots I share them with the team<br/>
Fuck boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slim Jimmy:]</i><br/>
Already told you niggas that I ain't gon' play<br/>
Already told my ho she better stop complaining<br/>
Damn that nigga already got that shiny bezel<br/>
Told that nigga I'm already on another level<br/>
Local thotties at this party already bopping<br/>
I just walked in thirty seconds getting topped of<br/>
God damn why I keep on shaking niggas hot sauce<br/>
Pull up in that new Camero I just left that sky loft<br/>
I promise I've already sipped<br/>
Woah, I told your ho come take a trip<br/>
If she bite them I know I'm fucking<br/>
If she hop inside the passenger I know I'm busting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
