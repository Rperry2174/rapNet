<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Can't stop this money flow broke ass nigga never<br/>
Hating ass nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I got them shooters on deck, aks with banana clips<br/>
We ain't bout that talking you get smoked like cancer sticks<br/>
My nigga only move a real niggas and goons<br/>
They don't know how to talk, they only know how to shoot<br/>
Dropped a coupla' bands, and get your top peel off<br/>
While I'm somewhere with some rich white folks playing golf<br/>
My Benz got a hole in the top like a dolphin<br/>
I'm on this codeine cause this weed got me coughin'<br/>
From Memphis Tennessee, where it ain't Ten-A-Key<br/>
Find a nigga dead in his house, he just a memory (You gone)<br/>
Niggas starving in these streets, coming for your stash<br/>
A gun plus a mask, you do the math<br/>
Still stepping on them blocks like hopscotch<br/>
Goons on deck shooting like they own a shot clock<br/>
Real nigga always counting like a stop watch<br/>
Pull them out the toaster, that turn you to a pop tart (Bitch)<br/>
Hundred bandz on a watch, bitch its my time (Bitch)<br/>
We was totin' pistols for school before Columbine (Always)<br/>
Juicy J, North Memphis Vet (You know it)<br/>
I went in and buy a Corvette and put it on my neck (You know it)<br/>
Money talk, you broke niggas is deaf (You know it)<br/>
Bitch I'm blowing on loud, and so is my check (You see it)<br/>
Fully automatics, no auto tune<br/>
I don't make no diss songs I'm leaving rappers with bullet wounds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Boss nigga, I be calling shots (Always)<br/>
You shaking ass niggas, be calling cops (They calling)<br/>
If I got any problems, I call them shooters (They coming)<br/>
My bitch got plenty racks, I call them hooters (They coming) <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Real shit real spit<br/>
Get your money up nigga<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Mafia
