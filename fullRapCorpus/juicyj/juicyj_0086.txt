(All I need is)<br/>
Uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
(All I need is)<br/>
You ain't gonna trust yo bitch after tonight<br/>
Uh huh, I'mma make her whore out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2 - K. Camp:]</i><br/>
All I need is one more drank, two more blunts, three more bitches<br/>
Four more zips, five more minutes<br/>
All I need is one more drank, one more drank<br/>
All I need is one more drank, one more drank<br/>
<br/>
All I need is one more skank, dirty pussy, suck my dick<br/>
Scary movie, I let her use me, all in her mouth<br/>
My dick in her booty, we all on the couch, the cameras is out<br/>
And she say she a virgin, bitch, shut the fuck uuupp!<br/>
I'm 'bout my bread, gettin' throwed, gettin' blowed<br/>
Gettin' trippy, gettin' lit on these hoes<br/>
Fuck 'em slow, in my cup, Colt .45, high as fuck<br/>
Twenty dab, hundred for the thousand dollar tab<br/>
Conjure my cab<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[K. Camp:]</i><br/>
Look, all she need is one more shot, that bitch lit, you can tell<br/>
Put this package, in yo box, you got mail<br/>
Smoke one more, touch that cloud, this that loud<br/>
That lil bitch, she get active, she get wild<br/>
We turnt up, too much liquor you can't hold me<br/>
Liked her pic, fucked her friend, now she know me<br/>
Drop my top, out that roof, that's that Rollie<br/>
Girl don't play, I'm right here, you gon' show me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Damn I miss the '90s, yeah shit was wild<br/>
We was livin' like rock stars, droppin' Mystic Styles<br/>
Ain't nobody else believe in what we was puttin' down<br/>
Nigga almost homeless trying to get it off the ground<br/>
No support everybody thought we never be shit<br/>
Tryna start our own label on some Master P shit<br/>
Tryna get some distribution majors labels ain't feelin' us<br/>
Doors slammed in our face, still ain't givin' up<br/>
Still on the grind, still on the rise<br/>
Even had to sell my whip to pay for studio time<br/>
Made a name, made some change, got respect, got some fame<br/>
Now they love our shit, cuz we made our own lane<br/>
Tryna sign everybody, put some money in their pockets<br/>
Had a ball on the rug, every night we had it poppin'<br/>
They ain't hold us down, did it on our own<br/>
With our backs on da wall, we put plaques on the wall<br/>
Then the problems started picking up, posse start splitting up<br/>
People started switching up, we still not giving up<br/>
I love them though, we been through it all<br/>
They're my brothers though, now that's some real shit<br/>
We weren't always rich, we didn't have a pot to piss<br/>
Hustle harder than a bitch, slanging records like they bricks<br/>
From the ground to the throne, its been a hell of a trip<br/>
Bring me one more drank, while I sit and reminisce
