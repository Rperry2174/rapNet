Who I be? Juicy J<br/>
One bitch won't do shit, I gotta fuck two a day<br/>
Always 'bout gettin' paid<br/>
Paper chasin' and I can't let a single dollar get away<br/>
Blowin' money like weed smoke<br/>
Spend a couple bands just to make it all double back<br/>
On the block like a running back<br/>
Put the chopper at your ass, have your tough ass runnin' laps<br/>
These niggas beefin' with each other over lame ass hoes<br/>
Seen the same bitch suckin' dick in the club for some Ros√© Mo<br/>
A few words of advice better keep my name off your tape, young nigga<br/>
I got niggas that'll kill for me, if I say the word they gon' pull that trigger<br/>
Once again, I be goin' in<br/>
I be at these niggas necks like a violin<br/>
Nigga fucked up, gotta go and try again<br/>
1-800-GET-RICH, broke nigga dial in<br/>
Let me tell you people what a boss is<br/>
You ain't rich if you still got broke friends<br/>
Cause you know they still hate on a nigga<br/>
Tryna get some money, they gon' send you up a river<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I don't trust these hoes<br/>
And I don't trust these niggas<br/>
I don't trust these hoes<br/>
And I don't trust these niggas<br/>
I don't get caught up though<br/>
I pull them triggers<br/>
Cause I don't trust these hoes<br/>
And I don't trust these niggas<br/>
<br/>
How can a nigga trust any one of you clowns?<br/>
When my own family let me down<br/>
Everybody in this mothafucka, hands out<br/>
Bullseye on a mothafucka's grands out<br/>
Sore thumb swag, niggas know I stand out<br/>
Pull up in the Casper, then the bitches ran out<br/>
Neck shine like police lights<br/>
Niggas lookin', say we hood light street life, beef's cookin'<br/>
Flash money 'round ratchet hoes, they gon' steal it<br/>
Bitch fuck with my money, somebody gettin' killed<br/>
Gotta watch these niggas, gotta watch these bitches<br/>
I trust my chopper to watch my riches<br/>
Sewed the game up like stitches<br/>
Fuck snitches, you niggas comin' up short like midgets<br/>
I try to keep the shit one thousand<br/>
With the niggas who kept it one thousand<br/>
I'ma hustle, fuck loungin'<br/>
When I didn't have shit, you didn't come around then<br/>
Thought she was my bitch, she was your bitch<br/>
Her bitch, his bitch, a for sure bitch<br/>
You caught feelings, now you wanna kill her<br/>
Don't get upset, dog, that's just the real her<br/>
These bitches love givin' head, love spendin' bread<br/>
Sellin' pussy on the low, what you said?<br/>
<br/>
