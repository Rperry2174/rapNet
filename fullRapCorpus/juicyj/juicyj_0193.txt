<i>[Project Pat (Juicy J):]</i><br/>
Sippin' on some sizzurp, sippin' on some sizzurp (mmm)<br/>
Sippin' on some, sippin', sippin' on some sizzurp (yeah)<br/>
Pour it on up, it's goin' down (yeah)<br/>
Sippin' on some sizzurp, sippin', sippin' on some sizzurp (Breezy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
I put that syrup in my double cup<br/>
Chop and screwed, body on the way<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
And baby, when you look into my eyes<br/>
You know why they open wide<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
All of these feelings, you catchin' feelings<br/>
And seein' all the signs<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
You pop this pill then tell me what you feelin'<br/>
And take it for this ride<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Got that soda bowl, then we glow, white girls put coke up their nose<br/>
Shakin' ass for Juicy J, I'm throwin' money 'til they close<br/>
Seen 'em all, seen me ball, pour it all, drank it all<br/>
Got that blower in the car, just in case it go that far<br/>
Roll up, pour up, what's the hold up? Hold up<br/>
I be slowed up, dozed off, off that slow stuff, woke up<br/>
I give no fucks, slow bucks, better than no bucks, so what?<br/>
That bitch chose up, feed her, need no coca, so up<br/>
I be rackin' up the M's, fuckin' hoes on film<br/>
Blowin' strong like the weed in the gym<br/>
Still sippin' that sizzurp<br/>
I been ballin' like arenas<br/>
And then two freaky foreign bitches<br/>
She ain't bad, told her don't bring her with them<br/>
I let her spend the night if my girl with it<br/>
We can have a threesome with them<br/>
<br/>

And take it for this ride<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>
Leanin', leanin'<br/>

<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
(Quavo)<br/>
Drank, drank, drank on me (drank on me)<br/>
Yeah, they call me young Quavo (Quavo)<br/>
Dropped the top, told your bitch, "Get in"<br/>
She gon' do what I say so (skrrt, skrrt)<br/>
She gon' do what I say so (skrrt, skrrt)<br/>
I told her count up the pesos (count it up)<br/>
Yeah, came from puttin' bricks in the cars like Maaco (bricks)<br/>
I don't get tired when I'm whippin' pies<br/>
Hit 'em with that circumcised choppers in my archive<br/>
Came from servin' the fiends on 'em<br/>
Now I'm in the coupe with the wings on it<br/>
Now I'm just lookin' for somebody to lean<br/>
Lean, lean, lean, lean on me<br/>
I advise you to pay up (cash)<br/>
Cut 'em off on the way up (cut 'em off)<br/>
I'm on the boards like a layup<br/>
On your hoe face more than makeup (bluh)<br/>
Bet I beat you to the paper (I bet it)<br/>
Cup filled with the Lakers (I bet it)<br/>
Blunt filled with the Lakers (yeah)<br/>
Bow, bow, I demolish a hater<br/>
