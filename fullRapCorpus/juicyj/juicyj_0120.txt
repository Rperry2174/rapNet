<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Nigga wonder why<br/>
Like where I been<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
Real niggas don't talk, about the dirt they did<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
We used to be homies<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
Money look good on me don't it?<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
Hell nah, I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
<br/>
There's certain niggas I don't fuck wit<br/>
There's certain niggas I don't fuck wit<br/>
Cause I go hard, and I ain't got time anymore<br/>
To waste all my goddamn floss<br/>
Seems every nigga wants me to fall<br/>
Oh well, landing on my car<br/>
Forgiato wheel let's keep it real<br/>
20 years in the game, still makin mills<br/>
I thought everybody liked it<br/>
Fuck nigga don't try me<br/>
Or end up in a situation you ain't gettin out of<br/>
Let me demonstrate a do-do-do-do-do, a hundred rounds<br/>
Fight night, yo life, outline<br/>
There's certains niggas I won't fuck with<br/>
There's certains niggas I won't fuck with<br/>
Like you, you, you, him, and that nigga<br/>
I don't fuck with y'all niggas<br/>
I'm too busy countin up until I see a hundred milly<br/>
Good riddance, my fingers itchy<br/>
<br/>
Nigga wonder why<br/>
Like where I been<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
Real niggas don't talk, about the dirt they did<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
We used to be homies<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
Money look good on me don't it?<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
Hell nah, I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
Hell nah, I ain't fuckin' wit it<br/>
Actin like you bout it undercover wit it<br/>
I been workin' like a fiend, nah mean right?<br/>
I ain't fuckin' wit it if it don't seem right<br/>
Only time I be about it is if the cream right<br/>
Motherfuckers wanna gas like a green light<br/>
Till that shit pop off and they out of sight<br/>
Ain't no wonder why they never really bout it right<br/>
Stay up out my business I've been with this<br/>
Can I get a witness fuck around and end up on they hit list?<br/>
Oh, I ain't fuckin' with it though<br/>
Mind on my money, give a fuck about a hoe<br/>
Money like mine, only come, never go<br/>
(When you finna fall off?) Never though<br/>
Bring that shit back like we've been there before<br/>
Like you got it for low, like you got it like woah<br/>
Handle my business, I'm in this, I'm ready, I'm steady<br/>
This life is the only I know<br/>
Fuck about another man talk about another man money<br/>
Get the fuck from me<br/>
Logic the realest, I don’t give a fuck if you hate this or feel this<br/>
As long as you feelin' this dick<br/>
Frontin’ in front of my eyes that shit<br/>
Be makin' me sick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Nigga wonder why<br/>

Hell nah, I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
I ain't fuckin wit' you<br/>
<br/>
Niggas be too fake man<br/>
<br/>
Getting a blowjob in an old-school Lamborghini Countach<br/>
I ain't kick it with no niggas I ain't beefing with no niggas<br/>
I'm just tryna get my pocket on Oprah<br/>
These niggas bitches got my name in they mouth like Botox<br/>
Meanwhile I've been on my own shit<br/>
Sitting on my throne getting bent like a crowbar<br/>
You gotta be about your money<br/>
Never let another motherfucker count your money<br/>
The niggas in your circle is not your homies<br/>
If they don't fuck with you without your money<br/>
There's certain niggas I won't fuck with<br/>
Thirsty ass niggas on the internet keep me off your timeline<br/>
Fifty niggas waiting at your door-step<br/>
Gotta watch your homies can't trust them all<br/>
They get your ass killed for that new car<br/>
Niggas they hate, never met a nigga who was motivated<br/>
Twenty million later and I'm still waiting<br/>
Thirty-Six Mafia inspired you niggas<br/>
Six niggas from the mud still fly on you niggas<br/>
Real niggas respect real niggas<br/>
I can't give a fuck about the realest nigga<br/>
Nigga wonder why?
