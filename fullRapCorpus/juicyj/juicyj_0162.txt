Ayy, mmm<br/>
Woop woop<br/>
<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
Look at shawty wavin' at me with her titties out<br/>
Look at all the ass she got sittin' out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
Errtime I slide through I bring the city out<br/>
Errtime I slide through I bring the biddy out<br/>
<br/>
This that Maybach music, I need Ross on it<br/>
S650, I'm a floss on it<br/>
Don't wet it up, throw the sauce on it<br/>
For the inside I double what it cost on it<br/>
I don't need a sun roof I got stars in it<br/>
Mine paid for nigga, y'alls rented<br/>
I could prolly fit a couple more broads in it<br/>
Nobody see you through the window cause they all tinted<br/>
Pull them curtains black, she pop another Percocet<br/>
Count up another check right before she gave me neck<br/>
I let the seats back, baby where the weed at?<br/>
I'm try'na free my mind, you know I need that<br/>
<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
Look at shawty wavin' at me with her titties out<br/>
Look at all the ass she got sittin' out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
Errtime I slide through I bring the city out<br/>
Errtime I slide through I bring the biddy out<br/>
<br/>
It's paid for, no leases nigga<br/>
My bankroll obese nigga<br/>
V12, <i>[?]</i> on police nigga<br/>
Yeah cause they be hatin' on a OG nigga<br/>
Wet paint goin' OC<br/>
So they can see theyself hatin' on me<br/>
A couple of wet bitches waitin' on me<br/>
And they can see theyself layin' on me<br/>
When I pull up in that thang it make them nervous<br/>
Got a driver, you can get that front door service<br/>
I can't let you drive that thang, girl just gon' be nervous<br/>
Hit the gass on they ass and get to swervin'<br/>
And we go 0 to 100 on the way to the money<br/>
I don't do this shit for nothin'<br/>
Cash money I be stuntin'<br/>
Got Chanel on my seat<br/>
Got Chanel on my feet<br/>
V12 in the hood<br/>
I leave 12 in the street<br/>
<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
Look at shawty wavin' at me with her titties out<br/>
Look at all the ass she got sittin' out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out<br/>
Errtime I slide through I bring the city out<br/>
Errtime I slide through I bring the biddy out<br/>
<br/>
It ain't too many niggas built like me<br/>
Where I can look a girl in the face and say<br/>
"Do you want to suck my dick?<br/>
Do you want to have sex with me?<br/>
Yes or no"<br/>
And if the bitch say no, "aight bye good luck"<br/>
I'm not tryna get to know you<br/>
What we exchanging numbers for?<br/>
I'm not keeping in contact<br/>
I don't even be on my phone<br/>
I play Pokemon GO more than I text these hoes, you know what I'm saying
