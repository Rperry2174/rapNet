Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up<br/>
We Trippy Mane<br/>
Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up<br/>
Juicy J<br/>
Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up<br/>
Kreayshawn<br/>
Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up Bitch, Get Up<br/>
You Know it<br/>
You trippy mane, I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
You trippy mane, I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
I'm smoking callie kush, pour up the drank<br/>
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane<br/>
Juicy J and Kreayshawn, that's a smoking marathon<br/>
I take a shot, I take a shot, that's a drinking marathon<br/>
Double cup of that kickstand all I know is big bands<br/>
Juicy j got bitches, fuck with my pimpin<br/>
Pinky ring on my pimp hand, with the lean as I pimp stand, oohh sound<br/>
Like snoop dogg, coupe de ville with two broads sipping on that texas tea, niggas call me boss hog<br/>
At your local college baggy full of adderall<br/>
With a strap on me, fuck the gun law<br/>
If you blow my high then I'm going off<br/>
Trippy, trippy, trippy, I don't think you get it mane<br/>
I walk around the club smelling like a synex mane<br/>
<br/>
You trippy mane, (She Trippy Mane) I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
You trippy mane, (She Trippy Mane) I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
I'm smoking callie kush, pour up the drank (Heyy)<br/>
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane<br/>
You trippy mane, (She Trippy Mane) I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
You trippy mane, (She Trippy Mane) I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
I'm smoking callie kush, pour up the drank<br/>
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane<br/>
<br/>
He a trip, I'm a trip but no falling out<br/>
We bag corn syrup all up on the trap couch<br/>
Purple body shots on the bitch I let it drip<br/>
Rolled her head back now she saying she can't handle it<br/>
That's crazy he hid a trippy stick out her ass<br/>
Juicy j sat me down and taught me well in trippy class<br/>
I got so much trip, I fell asleep high<br/>
I woke up high, if I'm sober, I lied<br/>
That's some downers man they really got my mind singing<br/>
If I was a car I'd be purple wood grain swinging<br/>
Leanin' over beanin' felonies and misdemeanors<br/>
So trippy mane you can call me Juicy Gina<br/>
<br/>
You trippy mane, (She Trippy Mane) I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
You trippy mane, (She Trippy Mane) I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
I'm smoking callie kush, pour up the drank<br/>
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane<br/>
You trippy mane, I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
You trippy mane, I'm trippy mane, (we trippy mane)<br/>
I'm smoking callie kush, pour up the drank<br/>
With a lot of bad bitches, get trippy mane
