It's the first in the month in the club I'll...<br/>
I got money in my hands, I like to watch the dance!<br/>
Open up that, open up that, open up that drink!<br/>
Open up the drink, put that in my cup,<br/>
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up,<br/>
Since we party, since we party, party!<br/>
Damn son!<br/>
Where is you part now!<br/>
<br/>
It's the first in the month in the club I'll...<br/>
I got money in my hands, I like to watch the dance!<br/>
Grow our party...<br/>
And I'm always on a,.. act like Jessie James.<br/>
Man I love... I'd like to screw my fans,<br/>
I'm a let her get me... do it with no hands!<br/>
I'll keep her burning in my pocket and...<br/>
And if you violate me I'm a pull the trigger, man!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Open up the drink, put that in my cup,<br/>
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!<br/>
Since we party, since we party, party!<br/>
Damn son!<br/>
Where is you part now!<br/>
Open up the drink, put that in my cup,<br/>
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!<br/>
Since we party, since we party, party!<br/>
Damn son!<br/>
Where is you part now!<br/>
<br/>
Standing on the furniture...<br/>
I don't need it, I don't feel it...<br/>
Cause it's covered up,<br/>
We got the whole club covered up!<br/>
Killers... you see them, we see them...<br/>
Me in VIP I got a...<br/>
I'm intoxicated cause around me they started doing up,<br/>
Get them out of here! My gang give me a new boss!<br/>
... haters like a free...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Open up the drink, put that in my cup,<br/>
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!<br/>
Since we party, since we party, party!<br/>
Damn son!<br/>
Where is you part now!<br/>
Open up the drink, put that in my cup,<br/>
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!<br/>
Since we party, since we party, party!<br/>
Damn son!<br/>
Where is you part now!<br/>
<br/>
Looking like every day's my birthday,<br/>
Come home Max, it's time to kill him in the worst way!<br/>
What you want, dick?<br/>
Well, let me sabot you,<br/>
Now I'm in the club, there's no... like the... do!<br/>
... louder than the opera do,<br/>
And if she says she don't like me then she probably do!<br/>
And where the club is, she gonna wait for me?<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Open up the drink, put that in my cup,<br/>
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!<br/>
Since we party, since we party, party!<br/>
Damn son!<br/>
Where is you part now!<br/>
Open up the drink, put that in my cup,<br/>
Standing on the furniture, now we're turning up!<br/>
Since we party, since we party, party!<br/>
Damn son!<br/>
Where is you part now!
