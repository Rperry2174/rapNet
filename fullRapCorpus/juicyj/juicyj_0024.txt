<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Niggaz violate I let them <i>[?]</i> with it<br/>
I got the magazines and you can get your issue<br/>
You can get your hand shut and I ain't talking <i>[?]</i><br/>
Six feet deep your family gonna miss you<br/>
<i>[Repeats]</i><br/>
<br/>
They are coming to your shit this is serious<br/>
You must be thinking Juicy J ain't that nigger <i>[?]</i><br/>
I will pay you nigger 20 <i>[?]</i> to keep your <i>[?]</i><br/>
Anybody wanna see you dead they know they are pitching in<br/>
All I know is the <i>[?]</i> in your heart I keep a <i>[?]</i><br/>
All my guys all my killer team can be your best friend<br/>
You missed a kid, nigger I don't give a shit<br/>
Blown if they catch your <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
They are coming by your clock let them chop a shot<br/>
Nigger should know ain't no good about the world <i>[?]</i><br/>
Nigger should have known act a fool will blow your ass up<br/>
Nigger should have known I got some glue to take that lights off<br/>
Walk upon your room to get a <i>[?]</i> to cut your head off<br/>
You don't even wanna know the gun that cut your <i>[?]</i> off<br/>
Want it to your face they're gonna take the <i>[?]</i> off<br/>
Don't you try to run they'll pull your gun it's gonna be real <i>[?]</i><br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i>
