<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>

I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm no my way but I ain't tryina stay<br/>
I'm just tryina smashing dash like the other day<br/>
Ain't nothing changed, give me brain, I'm stuck in my way<br/>
I ain't tricking, I pay up bitch to get out my face<br/>
See, that's the pimping in, I want these niggas envy<br/>
I hit their bitch and I'd be gone and leave your pockets empty<br/>
I swear my trigger finger got it bustin' like a semi<br/>
I play these hoes like Michael Jordan, you just got it pimping<br/>
See, I'd be Dodgers bitches, I got a lot of misses<br/>
May your bitches wanna get my dick a lot of kisses<br/>
She keep telling me she love me, I don't wanna hear it<br/>
Bitch the only time I'm tricky when I'm disappearing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>

I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm always on the mission, I got a lot of women<br/>
Ain't no relationship after I get that mouth I'm dippin'<br/>
Put so much OG Kush upon a scale I got a tippin'<br/>
And now she caught me trippin', that wasn't my intention<br/>
Bombay I'm always sippin', KK that's my religion<br/>
Them niggas talking down to one come on missing<br/>
Them bitches won the Grammy, got a pot to piss in<br/>
Tryina get another one, don't give a fuck about your mansion<br/>
Who paying for the clothes?<br/>
Why your clip full of hoes?<br/>
Why you wise up my shows?<br/>
All the real niggas know!<br/>
Ain't any too many left of us<br/>
She ain't new addition, she do this on the regular<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>

I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I just touch down in the city and I need that fix<br/>
If the air right it up, I might keep you on the list<br/>
I bet the bitch are coming fuck me for some kids<br/>
She wanna fuck me cause I got a Maybach on my wrist<br/>
I call her hair darker, she keep the head proper<br/>
She need a head boy cause I'm the bed rocker<br/>
Told her she running out of time, I got a shy o'clock<br/>
She wanted kick it all day, but we playin' soccer<br/>
I hit her, she hit me right back<br/>
My nigga she know what I'm on<br/>
I'll let her play with the money<br/>
Other than play with my ball<br/>
She told me her nigga was weak<br/>
So I let her smokin' this strong<br/>
I hear that they're putting to sleep<br/>
But I get right back in my zone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch<br/>
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch<br/>
