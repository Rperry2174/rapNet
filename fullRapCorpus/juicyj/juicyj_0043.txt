<i>[Project Pat:]</i><br/>
Yeah it's Project Pat in this thang... This goes out to all real<br/>
Niggas mayne... You gettin' that money you gotta keep gettin' that<br/>
Cheese man... You know what I'm sayin'? And those who sittin'<br/>
Around waitin' on a handout, nigga, keep waitin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose<br/>
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose<br/>
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose<br/>
I been gettin' money, I been gettin' money<br/>
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose<br/>
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose<br/>
The cars, the clothes, the life, I chose<br/>
I been gettin' money, I been gettin' money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Project Pat]</i><br/>
The gutta, the hood, the drugs, what's cookin'?<br/>
The guns, the mask, the young broads hookin'<br/>
The grams, the zones, the hundred for the tens<br/>
The county, the state, the fed-e-ral pen<br/>
Police in them high speeds now that's where I been<br/>
Ya left ya house unattended, was breakin' in<br/>
Old heads 'round the way say I need to cease fire<br/>
Cocaine habit like, water to the grease fire<br/>
Nines, big pinky rangs, flashy like King Tut<br/>
Dirty South ain't havin' thangs, do you see the bling what?<br/>
Candy paint, on the cars, hazelnut wood<br/>
Twenty fo' inch floaters floatin' through the hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I'm on the slab tryna slang this pack of yams (yams)<br/>
Call me the sand man straight, outta Pakistan (stan)<br/>
I'm tryna get in, suckers better get this (this)<br/>
I'm tryna make it rich, ice on my wrizzist (wrist)<br/>
You on the grind every night, tryna get mine (mine)<br/>
Slangin blow, packs of pills and that goodie pine (pine)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Paul:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I specialize in bein' a specialist (specialist)<br/>
Don't make money ain't makin' our list (what?)<br/>
Except ya girlfriend cause she insist (she insist)<br/>
I got the chewin' so long I left her with' a lisp (with' a lisp)<br/>
I make the ones hatin' feel shitty (really)<br/>
Show my ass buyin' the same cars as P. Diddy, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Project Pat]</i><br/>
I been gettin' money from the crumbs to the purse snatchin'<br/>
I kept a mask on with' the guns click-clackin'<br/>
Project was straight jackin' drug dealers to the fiends<br/>
I wasn't comin' up I had dreams of comin' clean<br/>
About this ghetty green, night and day I plot and scheme<br/>
Was in the project sellin' pills sippin' lean<br/>
Nigga I'm hustlin', where the bullets never ceaseful<br/>
It's always gunplay, cause ya mouth stay in grease-ful<br/>
Get a treeful, my candy like Honeydew<br/>
They see me in my car, dog, this what money do<br/>
Ya baby mama wanna holla so you hate to this<br/>
I'm talkin' money talk some can't relate to this<br/>
<br/>
