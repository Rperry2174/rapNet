<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Fuckin' with my cheese that come with beef, like Rotel<br/>
Wildin' in the club, give us room, like hotels<br/>
And I'm pimpin' hoes so you better catch this wholesale<br/>
Haters wishin' that I fall off, oh well<br/>
Fuckin' with my cheese that come with beef, like Rotel<br/>
Wildin' in the club, give us room, like hotels<br/>
And I'm pimpin' hoes so you better catch this wholesale<br/>
Haters wishin' that I fall off, oh well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I used to ride Chevy's, now it's Bentley coupes and Maybachs<br/>
From the Dirty South, fresh and clean, like some Ajax<br/>
Back when I was broke, all these hoes thought I was ugly<br/>
Now my money long and all these hoes slutty<br/>
Let's go make a movie, I do my own stuntin<br/>
My money like bubbles, now watch me blow a hundred<br/>
A whole lot of drugs and some freaky snow bunnies<br/>
With "I Love Juicy J" tatted on they stomach<br/>
Let's go hit the town, smoke some Kush and get trippy<br/>
Trynna get high enough to do a song with Biggie<br/>
Straight from Hollywood to Hollywood, North Memphis<br/>
And what's the point of being rich if you can't spend it ho<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
AK-47, with the shoulder brace<br/>
First I poke your girl then hit her with that poker face<br/>
So many cars in my garage, ain't no walking space<br/>
Bitch I'm so high it feel like I can walk in space<br/>
Just ordered me a car that got a bed in it<br/>
When I get it I'm a fuck and get head in it<br/>
Ask me do I get it, you can see it can't you<br/>
When your girl leave me I bet her knees ashy<br/>
I bet her throat scratchy<br/>
I bet she call a taxi<br/>
You know I kill the pussy, toe tag it<br/>
And I'm always on time, but my roof absent<br/>
2 Chainz' charm bigger than a Volkswagen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I see why niggas out here hatin' me<br/>
Got that Stevie Wonder money, they'll never see<br/>
Whippin' 360's in that Lamborghini<br/>
With a cup of Dirty Sprite, poppin' beans mane<br/>
I don't handcuff hoes and make 'em my bride<br/>
Just take 'em to the telly put my dick inside<br/>
30 stacks for a gig<br/>
My pockets fat as a pig<br/>
30 inches on the whip, sit high like a rig<br/>
I got more bitches, than a dog catcher<br/>
And that Bill Gates bread is what I'm chasing after<br/>
Brightlin watch, with the diamonds, is a hoe grabba<br/>
And I stay spaceship high, I don't need NASA<br/>
<br/>
