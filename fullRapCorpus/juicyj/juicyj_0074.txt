<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yo!<br/>
My lil bruh Wiz just uh<br/>
Poured me some champagne, appreciate that bruh<br/>
I first pissed some real shit man, you know what I'm sayin so uh, you know<br/>
We trippy<br/>
Getting fucked up<br/>
You know what I'm sayin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1: x2]</i><br/>
Roll em up, pop em up<br/>
Roll em up, pop em up<br/>
Roll em up, pop em up<br/>
That the bidness, get the bidness up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Trippy niggas<br/>
Real shit, real shit, let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Scared young nigga let me put you on to the game<br/>
Fuck do you think they know? Make sure ain't nothing lame<br/>
No trickin a nigga, don't trip at a nigga<br/>
A nigga might come back and bust all you niggas<br/>
And these hoes shy, make sure you get the prize<br/>
Before you roll the dice<br/>
Ratchet ass hoes<br/>
Pocket full of money, know a lil something<br/>
Life getting silly, you get mo fo a bundle<br/>
Take it from me pimpin, me I'm like forgive it<br/>
The way I hear we don't consider that lyrics<br/>
Fuck that bitch, mistreat that bitch<br/>
Say it again, say that shit again<br/>
If they start killin give em the barrel end<br/>
Give your all again, and this will never end<br/>
It's the different kind but have me for a man and a pimp<br/>
Our beach half full of these niggas getting sick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2:]</i><br/>
I'm so turnt up I won't turn down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Not that Charlie Brudges so don't play with me<br/>
Guns like roommates, they stay with me<br/>
Plenty goons and they gon spray with me<br/>
Nigga I'm 1000, I'm a stay a G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Nigga pick the wrong day for they fuck shit<br/>
He mustn't heard I'm bout that fuck shit<br/>
Baby choppa, fresh out the bars nigga<br/>
You was hard then now you actin box nigga<br/>
I'm on the beam, I wanna pop a nigga<br/>
I blink my eyes, my youngin shot the nigga<br/>
Ballin on these haters, I don't need a GM<br/>
Shootin shootin at yo ass, like do a rim<br/>
Put yo ass up like you took a swim<br/>
Choppa chop em down, call him a lim<br/>
Trippy ass niggas turnt up OG<br/>
Killers finding where you live then they going in<br/>
Run up in yo shit, take yo presidents<br/>
Give everybody no evidence<br/>
North niggas, we don't talk, we a mug a bitch<br/>
