<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I been working, working, working, working hard<br/>
Every, every, every, every day, day, day<br/>
I been working, working, working, working hard<br/>
Every, every, every, every day, day, day, day<br/>
Working, working, working, working hard, working hard<br/>
Every, every, every, every day, day, day, day<br/>
Working, working, working, working hard, working hard<br/>
Every, every, every, every day, day, day, day<br/>
<br/>
I been working, working, working, working harder than a bitch<br/>
Got my homies with me balling, you can call that an assist<br/>
Watch me kick some dope shit<br/>
Like its all in a wrist<br/>
I might trip yo girlfriend, bet she fall on the dick<br/>
I got goonies, I got shooters on standby<br/>
Watch how quick I pull up like a landmine<br/>
I just broke up off my lil shawty, 90k like it ain't shit<br/>
Told her bring me back a pound of kush, and she can keep the rest<br/>
I got roaches in my ashtray, I'm bugging<br/>
Make yo bottom bitch wipe my kicks, if I scuff em<br/>
There's big money talking, nigga quiet down and listen<br/>
My bad I keep forgetting, you too broke to pay attention<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Running out of room, gotta count it on the floor<br/>
Need a money counter cuz my thumbs getting sore<br/>
Thumbing through the check, frostbite on my neck<br/>
Girl all in my lap, I'm trying not to wreck<br/>
2 hunnid on the gadgets this a car or a jet<br/>
Shit I'm on some fucking fire, you stand too close you break a sweat<br/>
Double cup up in my Aston Martin Prado<br/>
Out in LAX, just leaning like a cholo<br/>
And I got the iron on me, bitch I'm never solo<br/>
Watch how quick I throw a bullet at yo ass, Tony Romo<br/>
Rich nigga talking you need to quiet down and listen<br/>
God damn I keep forgetting, you too broke to pay attention<br/>
<br/>
