These hands done rack through plenty cash (swag)<br/>
These hands done slap plenty ass (swag)<br/>
These hands done whip plenty niggas (swag)<br/>
These hands done bust plenty triggers (swag)<br/>
<br/>
These hands done rack through plenty cash (swag)<br/>
These hands done slap plenty ass (swag)<br/>
These hands done whip plenty niggas (swag)<br/>
These hands done bust plenty triggers (swag)<br/>
<br/>
With no thinkin' blew a half a ticket, when shit break I don't fix it<br/>
My last bitch wore red bonds, my new bitch just learned the business<br/>
Bill Gates so old school, I'm speedin' by in a old scoov<br/>
Bad hoes, no more ruse, findy belt, ballet shoes<br/>
High fashion for a hard nigga<br/>
A bunch of bitches, them high niggas<br/>
I'm rich fool with a lot of tools<br/>
When the bad guys went, I left the pool<br/>
Just a song, they got all wet<br/>
I got a outer driss<br/>
It would be an understatement if I'd say we have sex<br/>
When Juicy in the club, them hoes be catchin' up<br/>
Cause I can't help it every time she bring that ass out<br/>
Angelina Jolie, that mouth could give no better<br/>
I just let her cool off then kick off the double header<br/>
<br/>
These hands done rack through plenty cash (swag)<br/>
These hands done slap plenty ass (swag)<br/>
These hands done whip plenty niggas (swag)<br/>
These hands done bust plenty triggers (swag)<br/>
<br/>
These hands done rack through plenty cash (swag)<br/>
These hands done slap plenty ass (swag)<br/>
These hands done whip plenty niggas (swag)<br/>
These hands done bust plenty triggers (swag)
