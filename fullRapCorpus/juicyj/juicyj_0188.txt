<i>[Intro - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
It's a lot been going on mane<br/>
Know I'm saying'<br/>
Time for me to address this shit<br/>
Tired of hearing about it<br/>
Let's go, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
(These hoes)<br/>
They for everybody<br/>
Pass them all around, they at every party<br/>
They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody<br/>
Still I love these hoes<br/>
(These hoes)<br/>
They for everybody<br/>
Oh, that was your girl? oops, I'm sorry<br/>
Don't bring her around, this just too much money<br/>
Yeah I love these hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
She's a superfreak, superfreak<br/>
Met her in Liv last week<br/>
She was in there with Meek<br/>
In VIP, then she left with me<br/>
She said she fuck with Breezy<br/>
Do I wanna keep it? Nah, that ho too sleazy<br/>
Now she fuck with Jeezy<br/>
Don't believe me? The shit's all over TV<br/>
Now she work the pole, but you ain't know<br/>
That's how she make her dough<br/>
Seen her in New York<br/>
She was all throwed, forgot we met before<br/>
She say she fuck with Drake<br/>
I ain't surprised, all these hoes fucking with Drake<br/>
I asked why she out this way<br/>
Said she on a date, then she left with Trey<br/>
When will niggas learn?<br/>
Hoes like a doorknob, everybody gets a turn<br/>
Chicks be so high-class on the internet<br/>
But don't got shit she earned<br/>
She got that bag from Juicy J<br/>
She got that ass from Rudy Gay<br/>
Now your silly ass down on one knee<br/>
Fuck man, is you cray?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>

They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody<br/>
Still I love these hoes<br/>
(These hoes)<br/>
They for everybody<br/>
Oh, that was your girl? oops, I'm sorry<br/>
Don't bring her around, this just too much money<br/>
Yeah I love these hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Man, I fell in love with a stripper<br/>
Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker<br/>
They don't pay attention to love anyway<br/>
They only concerned with what the haters say<br/>
Bottles be turnin these girls into thots<br/>
Instagram turnin these wifes into hoes<br/>
No real life they just readin the comments<br/>
Mess with a real one and get you exposed<br/>
I had a time when my mine was caught up<br/>
My niggas was lookin like what is he on<br/>
My family was too scared to talk to a nigga<br/>
Ain't comin back now the case just got closed<br/>
She do what she told<br/>
Sharin is carin that pussy ain't gold<br/>
Sorry you ain't in control<br/>
You all about that money, thats shit that I throw<br/>
Just make sure you clean off that pole<br/>
They turn on the TV and get on the gram<br/>
And say that's relationship goals<br/>
Trust me don't save em' anything goes with...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
(These hoes)<br/>

Oh, that was your girl? oops, I'm sorry<br/>
Don't bring her around, this just too much money<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Stop cuffing my nigga<br/>
Is you the police?<br/>
Is you the police?<br/>
Is you the police?<br/>
Why you cuffing my nigga?<br/>
Is you the police?<br/>
Is you the police?<br/>
Is you the police?<br/>
