Shawty I ain't trying to be to,.. the absence is yours<br/>
I just heard stories about that glorious inventory wondered to see what you have in store<br/>
I could be a freak if I need to be, I'm saying I could please your needs<br/>
So them appointments with them toys and things they need to cease cause they can't even compete with me<br/>
If I ain't precise and you ain't suffice and I make time if I got to<br/>
But before you get more outta I need to get inside you<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
<br/>
Hey, what to do love? Wassup, babe? Hold time, I ain't ready about the foreplay<br/>
I'm a just shoot like Marc Scorsay<br/>
See, understand my forte,<br/>
See, home makes you up, let me smell your make up<br/>
Before I break you off, can I taste your love and let you up<br/>
You always fuck before you go, let me make you come<br/>
I make that around like a force it, and I'm patient, I don't force it<br/>
And I ain't playing for your cushin, cause while they been on that bullshit<br/>
Got a tattoo with your ex man but I will make you say it's sure shit<br/>
That's my shit but I parle on her private, and I got this<br/>
Shawty go ahead, slide them, she ride it till she's tired<br/>
I inspire loss of pain, she's got that awesome shit, I pork em bitch until I pull her... in<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
<br/>
I'm his 32 don't try to holler with them dollars...<br/>
Catch me popping bottles in the corner what about is it?<br/>
He wanna lick the kitty cat, got him playing...<br/>
Gotta get that paper, if you wanna get with it<br/>
I'm coming from a city dead, really like the doe we be<br/>
He... a heart attack life's with it he follow that<br/>
Cause I got the hardest rap, plus I spit the coldest blood<br/>
I be there on my tipsy toes,.. let it go<br/>
... question... we fly as fuck, bbs is in the chain<br/>
If you hear me, know my name<br/>
You fuck you would evade<br/>
Cock is some shrink, he name trying to holler less this dollar about a chain<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
<br/>
Why lady, I love but you get smoke... down the... high<br/>
And want a ride in my car, she's sick of my dickbone drive<br/>
Long as she fuck above, I know... she's get fine<br/>
Longer she... wine<br/>
I like the way she dance, bounce that ass, break that back<br/>
Let me take my 2 fingers and play round with that pussycat<br/>
I know it's dripping wist, let's do it, let's take some patrol shots<br/>
If you can, jump on in, and ride my dick like I've never had done before<br/>
Do it like a stripper, anything you want I'm by the store<br/>
Call off the show on floor<br/>
You know I'm stupid rich but you can't be mine<br/>
And that nigger...<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
Wake up in my room, sat upon my mat<br/>
Woman gotta talk, I can hit it from the back<br/>
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back,<br/>
I can hit it from the back<br/>
Why lady.
