<i>[Intro: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Play me some pimpin', man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, hundred thousand for the car, uh<br/>
Smokin' weed, I'm in the stars, uh<br/>
Just bought it, now I need a Porsche, uh<br/>
Juicy geeked up off them bars<br/>
Smokin' weed, I'm in the stars <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Taylor Gang in the strip club, ballin' out<br/>
If you see a pussy nigga, gon' call 'em out<br/>
My Bugatti outside, that's real money<br/>
I got niggas in my circle that'll kill for me<br/>
I take your life savings, spend it on a watch<br/>
Made an anthem for them strippers, put it on the charts<br/>
Pass that Grey Poupon, rich nigga talk<br/>
Gettin' that white folk money, what the fuck you thought?<br/>
Hell nah, I ain't shit<br/>
Ain't no broad I can't hit<br/>
Ain't no weed I haven't smoked<br/>
Ain't no car I can't get<br/>
Ain't nowhere I haven't gone<br/>
No kind of rack I haven't spent<br/>
If you ain't gon' blow it all, why the fuck you have it then?<br/>
I make your bitch pay for the zip<br/>
I let your bitch swallow my dick<br/>
I let your ho ride in my car<br/>
I took that bitch straight to the stall<br/>
I took that bitch down to my greenhouse<br/>
And let the ho leave with a jar<br/>
I let the bitch open my rap book, and watched her sniff a bar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Man, I'm high as a fool, man<br/>
You know what it is<br/>
You know I always get this money!<br/>
24/7 grind, bruh<br/>
So, uh, let these hoes know<br/>
They get more bread<br/>
More rides<br/>
Going to the mall<br/>
And buying everything, all big-faced bills<br/>
We gon' do that shit high as fuck<br/>
So damn fucked up<br/>
We gon' call your bitch, nigga<br/>
<br/>
