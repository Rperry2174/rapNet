<i>[Juicy J (Gucci Mane):]</i><br/>
Mhm<br/>
ATL (it's Gucci)<br/>
Memphis, Tenn connect (turn up)<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J &amp; Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
All my bitches call me papi<br/>
Sloppy pockets, I'm poppin'<br/>
All these dollars I been clockin'<br/>
It ain't no way to stop it<br/>
My wrist so rocky, Liberace watchin', 3 mil on watches<br/>
So much ice, drippin' off me<br/>
You and your bitch could play hockey<br/>
I'm sippin' lean out a coconut cup, I'm in the tropics<br/>
I been countin' so much money, had to find me a hobby<br/>
I'm Czechoslaka, they watchin'<br/>
I got Rastas with choppers<br/>
Got the machine gun with cartridges<br/>
They runnin' in, they ain't knockin'<br/>
Steve Austin flossin', tell them it's a new boss in office<br/>
And if we ain't talking profit, it ain't no use in callin'<br/>
These niggas triple crossin', double cross, quadruple your losses<br/>
I heard them haters tried to block, I went bought two new Ferraris<br/>
<i>[Hook - Peewee Longway &amp; Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Double down with two pistols, ain't missinø no target<br/>
Right before the funeral, let you pick out your coffin<br/>
Had to triple cross the double cross, quadruple your losses<br/>
Sippin' lean like a coffee bean, ain't sleepin' on shawty<br/>
OK I doubled up the work, I put them things in the office<br/>
Then put them on the freeway, now I feel like I'm Rossy<br/>
Seen them peoples in my rear view, hit the gas and I lost 'em<br/>
Middle finger out the sunroof, they just mad cause I'm flossin'<br/>
Trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J &amp; Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
All these rubber bands, fuck what I'm gon do with a wallet?<br/>
I'm in the booth countin' money, I'm so goddamn cocky<br/>
My lil' bitch pop her pussy, I just might pop me a molly<br/>
That clean codeine got me geeked up, spill lean all over Versace<br/>
I got killers with me, they don't do no talkin' or boxin'<br/>
I got that long bread, I'm talkin' footlong pizza, no toppings<br/>
Throw them goons a little bread<br/>
We'll take your baby's adoption<br/>
And we ain't worried about the feds<br/>
AR's in secret compartments<br/>
Ain't been to sleep in the longest, I sip that drank like it's coffee<br/>
They say that Gucci's a Martian, I buy my enemies coffins<br/>
We handle business like bosses and treat the streets like an office<br/>
I had a duplex with a million worth of bricks in the closet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Peewee Longway &amp; Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Double down with two pistols, ain't missinø no target<br/>
Right before the funeral, let you pick out your coffin<br/>
Had to triple cross the double cross, quadruple your losses<br/>
Sippin' lean like a coffee bean, ain't sleepin' on shawty<br/>
OK I doubled up the work, I put them things in the office<br/>
Then put them on the freeway, now I feel like I'm Rossy<br/>
Seen them peoples in my rear view, hit the gas and I lost 'em<br/>
Middle finger out the sunroof, they just mad cause I'm flossin'<br/>
Trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
You ain't know I spent that dough<br/>
And you might catch contacts<br/>
I got shooters on my side and if I say the word<br/>
Then they ready for combat<br/>
Like Vietnam, wartime ain't no joke<br/>
Niggas be playin' till the bullets start sprayin'<br/>
Can't hide these guns 'cause the clips too long<br/>
Hunting for him, catch him hiding in his honeycomb<br/>
Turn his motherfucking house to a haunted home<br/>
Money long, get you touched in your front lawn<br/>
Shots so loud setting off car alarms<br/>
Run along, or be the next nigga dunked on<br/>
You be swearin' that you niggas got done wrong<br/>
Get you jacked, no mask, no gloves on<br/>
Beat a nigga ass, then turn it to a club song<br/>
Vet in the game, got packs to prove<br/>
Young niggas call me Uncle Juice<br/>
I got more cash than Uncle Scrooge<br/>
Ya'll niggas made up like Dr. Seuss<br/>
All ice, no CZ<br/>
I ball, ya'll niggas in the minor leagues<br/>
Real shit, I got the shit on lock<br/>
Bout to put this game in a DDT
