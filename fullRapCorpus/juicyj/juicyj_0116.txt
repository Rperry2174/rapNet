<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I get that money and throw it up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky<br/>
We going up, we going up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Just got a call, it might be your bitch<br/>
Tryna hit the bong, tryna bond, sure she blowing up my iPhone 6<br/>
Always gotta smile, my spirit stay rich<br/>
I'm focused on the love, the haters don't exist<br/>
But shit get hard, I really must admit<br/>
So I stay on my grind, away from the bullshit<br/>
Take another dab, blow this smoke out like it's hookah<br/>
You want a computer, shit is real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I get that money and throw it up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky<br/>
We going up, we going up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky<br/>
<br/>
I stay posted in the sky, shitting on them like a bird<br/>
Mad cause I block their calls, ratchets get on my nerves<br/>
Scratch my Forgi's on the curb so I bought another car<br/>
'Bout to pour me up some drinks, and shots on me at the bar<br/>
Ain't no way I ever stop, my next door neighbour's Augustus<br/>
My bitch coming straight from Venus, my kush coming straight from Mars<br/>
You know all we blow is loud, we flex with the check and ball<br/>
Holding heavy metal, you would think a nigga play guitar<br/>
<br/>
I get that money and throw it up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky<br/>
We going up, we going up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat:]</i><br/>
I remember days when a nigga couldn't blaze nothing J<br/>
Locked down in a cell dog, I was 10 hours away<br/>
From this day, niggas balling when he out this bitch<br/>
Gucci, Louis down, fresh to death like a casket<br/>
Pass the shit, inhaling green, I'm in the lab like<br/>
Baby mama head in my lap, getting her mind right<br/>
Slow head like for show bread, I ain't worried about nothin'<br/>
Used to be worried 'bout fighting these cases, now I'm worried 'bout stuntin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I get that money and throw it up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky<br/>
We going up, we going up in the sky<br/>
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky<br/>
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky<br/>
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky
