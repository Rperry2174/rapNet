Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
<br/>
Rolling through my old hood, old school Chevrolet<br/>
Sobic Triece and his momma had to get a plate<br/>
Running to my old hoe from back in the day<br/>
Made a nigga reminisce, now I miss that phase<br/>
Put a Chevy to the classic, why they tell <i>[?]</i><br/>
See my nigga from the hood, I throw 'em some paper<br/>
What a great day in Memphis, proud to be a G<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Getting ready for the show later on, got a suite at the Medicine, bad bitch come through<br/>
Got a shortclub rain, I'm a make it rain, strippers go nuts when they see Juice<br/>
I'm a throw <i>[?]</i> had to regroup<br/>
I be at <i>[?]</i> I never see you<br/>
Every girl stripper named candy, God damn it, tell 'em I got a sweet tooth<br/>
<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
<br/>
Came a long way from public housing to a house on the mountains<br/>
Now I got a chef chaffeaur and an accountant, I'm fly as a falcon<br/>
Back then we used to ride spinners, I bought the <i>[?]</i> every winter<br/>
Never ride classics, paint just splashing, never even got tint on the windows<br/>
A zip and a double cup, don't mind me, I'm bout to juice up<br/>
Pour out some drank for Lord Infamous<br/>
Pour a lil more for Koopsta<br/>
Feasting on all this cake, who would known I'd ball one day<br/>
All day long, get stoned and faded, this check cleared every time my phone vibrate<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
Stop by <i>[?]</i> 2k I picked up<br/>
Grizzly's then hit the strip club and play with ass and<br/>
Titties, I swear today was a good day<br/>
Smoking on the Juicy J<br/>
My own strain is on the way now let's get trippy<br/>
<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire<br/>
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire<br/>
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
