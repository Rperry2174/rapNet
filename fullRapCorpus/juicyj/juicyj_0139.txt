All lives matter<br/>
My prayers go out to all the families and all the victims<br/>
This shit need to stop mane, real shit mane<br/>
<br/>
Nigga got a hundred pills, tryna pay the bills<br/>
Get a hundred years, where the justice at?<br/>
White boy, same charge, shed a couple tears<br/>
Never see a cell, where the justice at?<br/>
Catch you with that bomb, you not going home<br/>
You ain't got no bomb, where the justice at?<br/>
And cops will gun you down, cause you tryna run<br/>
Swear they saw a gun, where the justice at?<br/>
<br/>
We just tryna get some money, can you blame a nigga?<br/>
Tryna make it out the mud, they wanna hang a nigga<br/>
They wanna take our freedom and put chains on us<br/>
We ain't all equal, they runnin game on us<br/>
Crooked politicians and private prisons<br/>
Give a nigga life sentence cause it's all business<br/>
He just tryna put some food on the table<br/>
And take care of his babies and his pregnant old lady<br/>
Laws pulled him over cause he ran a stop sign<br/>
He ain't even strapped, he'll probably still get shot down<br/>
Tried to call his lawyer cause he thought he had rights<br/>
Cops shot a nigga dead cause he fear for his life<br/>
<br/>
Nigga got a hundred pills, tryna pay the bills<br/>
Get a hundred years, where the justice at?<br/>
White boy, same charge, shed a couple tears<br/>
Never see a cell, where the justice at?<br/>
Catch you with that bomb, you not going home<br/>
You ain't got no bomb, where the justice at?<br/>
And cops will gun you down, cause you tryna run<br/>
Swear they saw a gun, where the justice at?<br/>
<br/>
You ain't safe at home, you ain't safe at work<br/>
If you black, you ain't even safe at church<br/>
You ain't got a case even on tape<br/>
Watch 'em kill a man on Instagram and still get away<br/>
We ain't got no piece, we ain't got no peace of mind<br/>
Everyday we leave the house, we're out here fighting for our lives<br/>
Born black with a target on your back<br/>
Where they shoot you over nothing they still wonder why you strapped<br/>
Came home from the feds, and he right back in the trap<br/>
Who the fuck gon' hire you? My nigga it's a wrap<br/>
You a felon and you lucky if they even shake your hand<br/>
Mane you crazy if you think they giving us a second chance<br/>
<br/>
Nigga got a hundred pills, tryna pay the bills<br/>
Get a hundred years, where the justice at?<br/>
White boy, same charge, shed a couple tears<br/>
Never see a cell, where the justice at?<br/>
Catch you with that bomb, you not going home<br/>
You ain't got no bomb, where the justice at?<br/>
And cops will gun you down, cause you tryna run<br/>
Swear they saw a gun, where the justice at?<br/>
<br/>
Mane, where the justice at?<br/>
Where the justice at?<br/>
Where the justice at?<br/>
You know everything ain't really about race man<br/>
It's motherfuckers out here just doin what the fuck they wanna do<br/>
And that's fucked up<br/>
Where the justice at?
