<i>[Hook - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
She rollin' weed<br/>
She rollin' weed<br/>
She rollin' weed<br/>
She rollin' weed<br/>
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke<br/>
<br/>
Lookin' at my Rollie, it's about that time<br/>
Ridin' with my white girl, lettin' her snort some lines<br/>
Might have to take a picture, boy, this bitch so fine<br/>
College girl become a stripper right before your eyes<br/>
Rollin' up and skatin' in my old school Jag<br/>
Lookin' like James Bond, fried like Cheech and Chong<br/>
Bitch slide out that thong and let me tap that ass<br/>
Filled the hot tub with money, now let's take a bath<br/>
Slippers and designer robes, come here lil' bitch, it's time to roll<br/>
Gettin' high and gettin' paid is the only thing my mind on<br/>
Pinky full of diamonds, bitch these ain't no rhinestones<br/>
Stack my money to the ceiling, you gon' have to climb on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Used to fuck with Swishers, now it's paper planes<br/>
Have lil' mama wetter than a hurricane<br/>
You not blowin' killer then stay in your lane<br/>
You niggas off track, I'm on the money train<br/>
Counter, I doze off so I can't complain<br/>
Bitch I'm just your comma, I am not your main<br/>
I smell like I grew a pound inside my car<br/>
Ballin' out, inside my car I got a bar<br/>
Nothin' but smoke, smell the loud on my clothes<br/>
Dammit, I'm stoned<br/>
Nothin' but dope, bought a few pounds to blow<br/>
And it's that strong<br/>
I'm in my zone, can't leave them ratchets alone<br/>
You know what I'm on<br/>
Ain't goin' home, got a dog ass bitch on my bone<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
