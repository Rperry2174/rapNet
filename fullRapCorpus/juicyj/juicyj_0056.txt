I need a money mane <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I need a nigga back in business,<br/>
Got my nigga spend it,<br/>
Go sleep up in it<br/>
And don't stop 'till you finish.<br/>
I need a money mane.<br/>
<br/>
Hold box of bum for me and my pussy<br/>
It's Juicy J, an unleash nigger and a lot of you can't copy<br/>
She came over dream and I let the bitch have it<br/>
I own the octopus the nigga glass stay glossy<br/>
Zympa stay marley, I'll be on the zinon<br/>
If you let your gee go on and I swear that we will find her<br/>
The diamonds don't blind, you will be reminded<br/>
Take back that cash or the hoes won't shake the ass<br/>
Everything I pay in cash, the land will go on extra fast<br/>
And the passenger is extra bed. We find him whip and smoking gas<br/>
The check ain't never gonna stop, that's why you're asking<br/>
<br/>
I need a money mane <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I need a nigga back in business,<br/>
Got my nigga spend it,<br/>
Go sleep up in it,<br/>
And don't stop 'till you finish.<br/>
<br/>
I drop white that sound, I get a load up<br/>
Keep doing in my passenger seat is my role, dog<br/>
If you're a girl I will miss you, take your clothes off<br/>
I'm smoking on this drog as bad 'till I doze off<br/>
Me ain't a perfect-a, this is a new chapter<br/>
All is fucking pain like a motherfucker cabba<br/>
And I'm from the A, I'm back to bring it back<br/>
Kid rock the way and Ludacris is an actor<br/>
Burn it like tobacco, south side track<br/>
Spear south would it like the F from the fucker<br/>
And you know I did it, I do it like this<br/>
You fuck with me, I show you how to throw a brick into a building<br/>
(Tell 'em)<br/>
I need a money mane, till the honey bram<br/>
Nigga, that's a mil', that pussy be quick sand<br/>
(Damn)<br/>
I'm up on in the thing like you will when I do<br/>
Chainsaw dawn, got you nigger lick it's tool.<br/>
<br/>
I need a money mane <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I need a nigga back in business<br/>
Got my nigga spend it<br/>
Go sleep up in it<br/>
And don't stop 'till you finish<br/>
<br/>
Why you niggers be loathing?<br/>
Fuck is over that bred<br/>
I ain't the type to be open<br/>
That's when talking with head<br/>
Hammer's up in that trash bag<br/>
Brick's up in that MCM<br/>
Hand tripping on no bitch<br/>
Scream like is for MPM<br/>
Stick it's tongue inside of box<br/>
Swaggy champ but 8 doughnut<br/>
Fuck 'em<br/>
Now go out in the 8th round<br/>
Oh, why lend it<br/>
Call the bitch all bangle<br/>
I know, I know, it gets better more than I know<br/>
<br/>
Niggers what you looking for?<br/>
Clean hope, I get the tool<br/>
Chandeliers in my ears and the fuck it for it, though<br/>
Hallow boost, hallow shirt, in the man let some fur<br/>
They come for so nuts, they be gone to the teachers square<br/>
All night on the b is gotta be<br/>
Throw booze in your throat<br/>
Baby gone, take a swallow<br/>
I body all night<br/>
Nice taste, looking raised<br/>
I send them raised while the ear in<br/>
<br/>
I need a money mane<br/>
I need a nigga back in business<br/>
Got my nigga spend it<br/>
Go sleep up in it<br/>
And don't stop 'till you finish<br/>
I need a money mane
