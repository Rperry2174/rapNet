<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Bullet holes leakin', people ain't peepin,<br/>
Four five in my drawers, got a nigga leanin'<br/>
Juicy J beastin and my four five singing<br/>
When that hoe go off a niggas ears be ringing.<br/>
Gangsta nigga doing gangsta shit,<br/>
She'll set a nigga up, that's right, I got a gangsta bitch.<br/>
My young niggas starving and you love it like a bargin<br/>
Shooting at the range and you look like the target<br/>
You was turned up, now you dearly departed.<br/>
I circle through your hood with my dogs, choppas barkin'.<br/>
The nigga ain't hard, these pussy niggas flexing<br/>
Ran to the car when I pulled out my weapon.<br/>
If you snitch you gotta die, if you smoke you gotta buy,<br/>
If they arrest your ass you gotta lie.<br/>
Need anything I got a guy (dope man)<br/>
20 years in the game and I'm still winning<br/>
Wasting money rolling weed and I'm still sipping.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
A veteran in the game and I'm still getting it,<br/>
Broke up with my ex and I'm still hitting it.<br/>
A nigga play with me, that stainless steel bussin'<br/>
I'mma hustle 'til I die, nigga, I'm still hustlin'.<br/>
A veteran in the game and I'm still getting it,<br/>
Broke up with my ex and I'm still hitting it.<br/>
A nigga play with me, that stainless steel bussin'<br/>
I'mma hustle 'til I die, nigga, I'm still hustlin'.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat]</i><br/>
County jail, fourth floor, robbery charge, penal farm,<br/>
HCI Memphis in the hole for the firearm<br/>
Project born, hood raised, shot niggas in the face,<br/>
2001, tried to book me on a murder case<br/>
Seen so many prison bars, that's why I got bars.<br/>
Depression had me on them bars, I stay on Mars.<br/>
Got my money out the sewer so that means is dirty<br/>
Police patrol at 7 A.M. so we hustle early,<br/>
'cause the early bird gonna get the worm<br/>
Play with my bread, choppa straighten you like a perm,<br/>
Kidnap and murk, niggas over drug dealing<br/>
First 48, you see them scary ass niggers squealing.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
A veteran in the game and I'm still getting it,<br/>
Broke up with my ex and I'm still hitting it.<br/>
A nigga play with me, that stainless steel bussin'<br/>
I'mma hustle 'til I die, nigga, I'm still hustlin'.<br/>
A veteran in the game and I'm still getting it,<br/>
Broke up with my ex and I'm still hitting it.<br/>
A nigga play with me, that stainless steel bussin'<br/>
I'mma hustle 'til I die, nigga, I'm still hustlin'.
