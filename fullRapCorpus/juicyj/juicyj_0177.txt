Play me some pimpin', mane<br/>
<br/>
And I'm ballin', I'm, I'm, and I'm ballin', I<br/>
And I'm ballin', and I'm ballin'<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
<br/>
Let 'em all in<br/>
Let them fall in it<br/>
Let them play with all the dollars<br/>
Let them bathe in it<br/>
House so large, put a maze in it<br/>
I'm the type that take your chick out for lunch<br/>
In the middle of the White House lawn<br/>
Then switch up, start filming porn<br/>
Might tell the First Lady she can join<br/>
Do what I want when I want<br/>
Nigga you can keep them two pennies<br/>
I got a tub so big you can come and take swimmin' lessons in it<br/>
Now I'm peelin' off in a spaceship, with the ceiling<br/>
She just want to show her titties off<br/>
Carpet roll out, wanna hop off<br/>
Bout to hit the club like golf balls<br/>
Paparazzi tryna catch a nigga off guard<br/>
Nigga got me off the chain like guard dogs<br/>
Come on, dog<br/>
I'm too high, hot air balloon<br/>
All star, I'm on another planet<br/>
I just joined the fortune five hundred<br/>
Now I'm in the boardroom in pajamas<br/>
<br/>
And I'm ballin', I'm, I'm, and I'm ballin', I<br/>
And I'm ballin', and I'm ballin'<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
<br/>
And I'm ballin'<br/>
When you're boss you don't take shit, you don't call in<br/>
So fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin<br/>
Folks ain't never gonna get it, I've been holding out long enough<br/>
Scratch that, now I'm on to somethin'<br/>
Fuck that, I ain't letting up<br/>
Cats gonna copy this shit<br/>
They gonna wanna hold my awards<br/>
Poor lil' Juicy J, this year I'm declaring war<br/>
Fuck they upset with me for?<br/>
Shut up J and be a decoy<br/>
Who the fuck they thinkin' we are?<br/>
M-Town ride smokin' blunts<br/>
We up, keep up, my chips, cheese puffs<br/>
That's real dope<br/>
See us Gd up, money talks, speak up<br/>
Sleep, what for?<br/>
I get some rest when I croak<br/>
I want a new island to dock my new boat<br/>
I went to the action and bought me a chopper<br/>
Now I need a new helipad for my home<br/>
<br/>
And I'm ballin', I'm, I'm, and I'm ballin', I<br/>
And I'm ballin', and I'm ballin'<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', off the glass<br/>
And I'm ballin', and one<br/>
And I'm ballin', blow the whistle
