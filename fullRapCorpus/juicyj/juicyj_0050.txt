<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm fucked up... (Fucked up...)<br/>
On the lean, poppin rows with a Kush blunt (Yup)<br/>
With a bitch; ass fat, sittin from the front (You know it!)<br/>
Mind gone, mane I'm trippin and my eyes low (Chuuuch!)<br/>
Everything purple, all I see is weed smoke (Oh!)<br/>
Codeine died, now my bitch gon' try (Mmm)<br/>
If you say "I ain't high", then you niggas lyin (Pussy)<br/>
A buncha trillist Memphis niggas, gettin throwed nigga (Bitch)<br/>
A buncha ho's at the crib, buncha O's nigga (Yep!)<br/>
Off that oil and it's dirty, and I'm feelin great<br/>
Smoke a blunt, or two, or three; just to keep me straight<br/>
You gettin high or what, ho? Make a decision<br/>
That medical Promethazine; Trippy prescription (Ho)<br/>
Cups overflowin, my vision is dizzy (Vision is dizzy)<br/>
I'm like Bobby Brown ho, without New Edition, chuch<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Purple-purple-purple; cup always full (Ho)<br/>
Pass it in a circle; E'rrbody smokin good (Nigga)<br/>
On the daily; Might smoke an ounce to fuck around (Yep)<br/>
Weed-mane; So high when I'm in ya town<br/>
Two thousand fifty, trippy (Trippy!)<br/>
She got a sippy-cup (Sippy!)<br/>
They say "Don't drink and sip that lean!", but I mix 'em up<br/>
Turned up to the max; real ranchid shit (Hmm)<br/>
She mad, and she smoked prolly half that bitch (Ho!)<br/>
You niggas still gettin tipsy; catch me leanin<br/>
Smoked some incredible; feel like I'm dreamin (Dreamin!)<br/>
My crib in Cali; Like Texas, sippin DJ Screw (Rest in peace)<br/>
Fridge full of bombay; but you can't find no juice<br/>
<br/>
