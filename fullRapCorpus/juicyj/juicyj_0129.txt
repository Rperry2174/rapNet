<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Nigga fund start runnin' low you know how they do<br/>
They never wanna blame they self they blame it all on you<br/>
I handle my business, I can't handle yours too<br/>
They can't talk me out my fuckin' money now they wanna sue<br/>
Nigga get off yo ass you can't walk in my shoes<br/>
Back when I was in the mud nigga where the fuck was you?<br/>
Mane this game so fake, first they love you then they hate you<br/>
Rappers diss you on the tape but in the street they scared to face you<br/>
You can't trust these record labels, ain't no friends in this shit<br/>
Niggas with you 'til they do a interview then they switch<br/>
Now they got so much to say, they on twitter throwing shade<br/>
I don't pay that shit no mind, I'm too busy getting paid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Call me when you start calling cinash'<br/>
I was in the yellow car with binash<br/>
Young nigga but I'm bout my bidness'<br/>
You was trippin' call me when you finish<br/>
Hundred grand in just a couple minutes<br/>
Lot of girls in here you the thickest<br/>
Brought your home girl what the deal is?<br/>
Had to kick her out she wasn't with it<br/>
Money on my mind, God that's my witness<br/>
I'm a take your phone, ain't no takin' pictures<br/>
Move like Obama so you think I'm tryna' diss ya<br/>
Call you in the morning you'll be thankful that I hit ya<br/>
Khalifa man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Family members all in my business and shit (fucked up)<br/>
Always on my phone talkin' bout give me some shit<br/>
I hear so many rumors, bitches gossipin' niggas too<br/>
You know its fucked up when niggas actin' like bitches do<br/>
I can't do yo show if you ain't got my deposit<br/>
You a janky promotor don't got my check its a problem<br/>
Niggas all on my line talkin' bout verses for free<br/>
So many clowns its startin' to look like a circus to me<br/>
They won't give a nigga space, tryna find out who I'm fuckin'<br/>
Wanna know all my business, like its gonna pay em or something<br/>
I know niggas be talkin' I know bitches be talkin'<br/>
But I got nothing to say if you ain't makin' a offer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>

Well call me when they start talkin' money<br/>
