<i>[Intro: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yessir... play me that spaceghostpurp beat mane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Ridin' in my black Bonneville bumpin' Three Six<br/>
Roll up 20 zig zags out of one zip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yessir...<br/>
Ridin a ghost, Trippin on dope<br/>
Drankin the filth, Passin a roach<br/>
Ball like I'm Kobe, when straight to the pro's<br/>
White girls are money, bank on my coat<br/>
Higher than I've ever been, drankin some gin<br/>
Let the hoes in, tell em bring a few friends<br/>
Smoking on the top, ashing on you fuck niggas<br/>
Eye's low, pop a xan, I'm drunk nigga<br/>
Pounds laying around my crib Juicy J ain't never even touch<br/>
Shawty passed out on the floor and she only hit the cheese weed once<br/>
Ain't no chips ahoy but this nigga right here keep cookies<br/>
Keep some OG, you motha fuckin niggas know I ain't no rookie<br/>
Lye second, smokin hit a few times and you niggas be chokin'<br/>
She don't even hit the weed all she do is break it down and roll it<br/>
Anti-sober, if I was probably be trippy<br/>
One ain't enough I'm rollin up two a stitches<br/>
All my real niggas smoke one if you with it<br/>
All my bad bitches smoke one if you feel it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Ridin' in my black Bonneville bumpin' Three Six<br/>
Roll Up 20 zig zags out of one zip
