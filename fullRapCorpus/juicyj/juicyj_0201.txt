Slob on my knob <br/>
Like corn on the cob <br/>
Check in with me, and do your job <br/>
Lay on the bed, and give me head <br/>
Don't have to ask, don't have to beg <br/>
Juicy is my name <br/>
Sex is my game <br/>
Let's call the boys, let's run a train <br/>
Squeeze on my nuts <br/>
Lick on my butt <br/>
The natural curly hair, please don't touch <br/>
First find a mate <br/>
Second find a place <br/>
Third find a bag, to hide the ho face <br/>
Real name rover <br/>
I said bend over <br/>
I started to knock, then came the odor <br/>
Smelled like mush <br/>
Shouldn't had a woosh <br/>
Told her to stop, and take a dush <br/>
When she did that <br/>
I didn't want the cat <br/>
So I bounced out and never came back <br/>
<br/>
Suck a nigga dick or something <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
My nigga D-Magic <br/>
Said he had to have it <br/>
I said just forget it, it's too crabby <br/>
I Know a little freak, in Hollywood <br/>
Sucks on dick, does it real good <br/>
She'll give you money, to feel up your tummy <br/>
House full of kids, parents all schummy <br/>
Once had her down, backyard ground <br/>
Hit it from the back <br/>
Enjoyed the sound <br/>
Lay on the cover <br/>
Always use the rubber <br/>
Till I got caught, fucking with her mother <br/>
She blamed it on me <br/>
We fought in the street <br/>
She pulled out a knife, so I had to flee <br/>
Called up the boys <br/>
Went to her house <br/>
Charged the whole place <br/>
Threw the bitch out <br/>
Police busted in <br/>
Where the niggas at <br/>
We left just in time, and never came back <br/>
Roll through the hood, waving at the freaks <br/>
Who's sniffing all the rocks, and smoking all the geeks <br/>
Made another stop <br/>
Police station <br/>
Saw a few cops <br/>
Drove by and sprayed them <br/>
Licensee tag number <br/>
A nigga said he saw <br/>
Bogus all the time <br/>
Never get caught
