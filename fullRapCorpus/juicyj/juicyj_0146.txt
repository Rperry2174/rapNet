I'm going to Miami this weekend bruh<br/>
I'm a hit up all the motherfuckin' strip clubs and leave a green carpet<br/>
Everywhere I go<br/>
<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, green carpet<br/>
'Bout to leave the strip club and leave a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Leave these hoes tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green<br/>
<br/>
First I start my night out with plenty shots<br/>
Then I tell the owner send me plenty thots<br/>
Naw bitch, I ain't throwin' none' 'til them panties drop<br/>
Don't need no ice for my drink, my chain got plenty rocks<br/>
They say that money talk, my pockets got a lot to say<br/>
If you let your money talk I bet you ain't got nothing to say<br/>
You can see me tipping from a mile away<br/>
Depend on how I'm feeling, you just might retire today<br/>
I know I just met you, but I just might bless you<br/>
I can tell you tryna get it and I just might let you<br/>
All these niggas at you, got you feeling special<br/>
I'm just getting started and I got you<br/>
<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, green carpet<br/>
'Bout to leave the strip club and leave a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Leave these hoes tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green<br/>
<br/>
Got her walking on the green<br/>
So she on' do me and my team<br/>
She holding on so tight to the pipe she remind me of a fiend<br/>
I been throwing money all damn night, this remind me of a dream<br/>
Soon as I walk in Magic City, bet you they gon' treat me like a king<br/>
Cause I'm dripping nothing but sauce<br/>
I pay the cost to be the boss<br/>
One thing I can't tell you is how to take a loss<br/>
One thing I can show these niggas is how to floss<br/>
Baby girl won't even play with it, she gon' go and take it off<br/>
Pimp game, I don't have none<br/>
He handcuff, he arrest y'all<br/>
Fuck with me, like a vacay I promise you I won't stress y'all<br/>
He call you, don't answer, what he want, don't matter<br/>
I'm 'bout to, look at you, I gotcha<br/>
<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, green carpet<br/>
'Bout to leave the strip club and leave a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet<br/>
Leave these hoes tip-toeing on a green carpet<br/>
Walking on a green
