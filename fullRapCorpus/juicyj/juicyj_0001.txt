<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
The Gangsta Desciples and the Vice Lords have teamed up<br/>
We gonna fuck the motherfuckin clubs up<br/>
The fuckin Liquids, know what I'm sayin<br/>
The D and D the spot, GD's! VL's!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Project Pat]</i><br/>
Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here<br/>
My niggaz, my hood, so you cowards betta fear<br/>
Man you hoes don't wanna clown<br/>

<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
The first nigga wanna step<br/>
Gonna meet his death<br/>
First I hit the nigga wit a right, then I swing a left<br/>
Kept on dropping B's after B's till I'm out of breath<br/>
Then I took a knife and cut the fool til he bloody wet<br/>
Boy you gon respect<br/>
Real playaz when it comes to that<br/>
Knowin this ain't slavery but nigga we gon hang your neck<br/>
How you gonna diss the check writer, hoe I am a threat<br/>
Shoot at your bitch ass like the killa know you scared of that, scared of that<br/>
Bring it on nigga to this motherfuckin M-Town<br/>
Click click boom then you feel your body fall down<br/>
Don't be trippin wit these Hyde Park gangstas<br/>
Robbers, killaz, dope boyz, rapists<br/>
Gangsta Fred, Heavy C, workin with that maintenance<br/>
Cut you up, wrap you up, leave ya ass stankin<br/>
Pimp slap ya ass, momma boy, fell the rugar<br/>
So fuckin sweet, I should probably call you sugar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Project Pat]</i><br/>

<i>[LaChat]</i><br/>
Now when I fall up in the club, I be yellin, smack a bitch<br/>
Steady mobbin wit a mug<br/>
Yeah this thug<br/>

Nigga what bitch, what?<br/>
Get the fuck up out my way<br/>
Throwin bows, pushin hoes<br/>
Lettin you know I'm in the place<br/>
It's whateva, get it done<br/>
Hope you cowards, got a gun<br/>
I'm a ride until I die<br/>
Makin bitches out here run<br/>
You can run if you wanna<br/>
Where you run is where you die<br/>
I'm a break me off a prada stick your ass in the eye<br/>
It's Chat, you got beef<br/>
All this animosity<br/>
Look here mane, I'm a aim<br/>
Shoot that thang<br/>
For playin me<br/>
You a killa<br/>
Bitch nigga<br/>
Never have you pulled a trigger<br/>
You got hoe off in your blood<br/>
When it rain, hoe you shiver<br/>
Have you ever seen a bitch come through the door and take the floor<br/>
Gangsta walkin, representin, cuz a mack ain't goin hoe<br/>
Breakin laws, fuck the law<br/>
Keep them bitches out my business<br/>
I'm a shut this junt down, everybody gonna witness, bitch<br/>

<i>[Chorus: Project Pat]</i><br/>
