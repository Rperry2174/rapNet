<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I'm like a nigga gettin' cream on a triple beam<br/>
So much money in my face I'm livin' a dream<br/>
Whips outside<br/>
Bitches wanna ride<br/>
Cause they know them trap niggas got them drug <i>[?]</i><br/>
They wanna get high for free and a shopping spree<br/>
Bitch roll me up some weed 'fore you hit yo knees<br/>
Want money in yo purse?<br/>
You gone have to work<br/>
Get your ass on the floor<br/>
Mix in with the dirt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
You want deez rackz ho?<br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo'<br/>
You want deez rackz ho?<br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo' <br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo' <br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo'<br/>
You want deez rackz ho?<br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo' <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
My neck is froze<br/>
Jewellery be 20 below<br/>
I'm waken baken<br/>
Money still risin' like dough<br/>
These bitches jockin' they think I'm in the NBA<br/>
I got money like them niggas but I'm Juicy J<br/>
Chrome rims on anything that's foreign<br/>
Bad bitches from overseas flown in<br/>
A big mansion all my weed stanky<br/>
So many titles under my belt Yankees<br/>
If you money hungry bitch I'm a feed ya<br/>
You actin' brand new<br/>
I'm a teacher<br/>
The trippy niggas don't really give a damn<br/>
I throw money in yo face bitch BAM!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
You want deez rackz ho?<br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo'<br/>
You want deez rackz ho?<br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo' <br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo' <br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo'<br/>
You want deez rackz ho?<br/>
Pick that shit up off the floo' <i>[x2]</i>
