On the road to Sri Lanka, the sun as sweet as Willy Wonka<br/>
She a 10, I'm a monster<br/>
Wanna get it in? I'm the sponsor<br/>
We just flew over Dubai, we just made love in the sky, we just might never come back, it's what they call a perfect match<br/>
<br/>
Hop in the new Lamborghini, in your new Gucci bikini, we used to sit on martinis, now we sippin' on bellinis<br/>
<br/>
Dedication turn to frustration, all we needed was a conversation, medication, and some meditation<br/>
All we needed was a little patience<br/>
<br/>
All she needed was the perfect guy, all I needed was a ride-or-die<br/>
All she ever asks is that I try, all I ever ask is never lie<br/>
<br/>
Takin' pictures of expensive dinners, makin' babies in expensive rentals<br/>
Never endin', but we just beginnin', we just started but we never finished<br/>
<br/>
This is everything you ever wanted, this is everything you ever needed<br/>
This is everything you wanted and more, I know you complete it<br/>
<br/>
This is more than you can ask for, filling papers in your passport<br/>
Would you really rather ride for?<br/>
Or would you really rather die for?<br/>
<br/>
I'm on a road to Sri Lanka, I'm on a road to Sri Lanka, I'm on a road to Sri Lanka<br/>
<br/>
(Fix your face!)<br/>
<br/>
