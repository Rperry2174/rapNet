<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm sick of these lying ass niggas, crying ass niggas<br/>
Saying you the plug, ain't nobody buying nigga<br/>
I'm sick of these fake ass niggas, hating ass niggas<br/>
Claiming you a goon, you a shaky ass nigga<br/>
Pussy buying ass nigga, lying ass nigga<br/>
You marry the ho, and you the side nigga<br/>
I'm sick of these broke ass niggas, joke ass niggas<br/>
Lemme hold something, shut up you po' nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm sick of these so called hustlas<br/>
Claiming they chasing commas<br/>
Showing all yo whips on vine<br/>
But you still shacking up with yo momma<br/>
Run yo mouth when you up with yo partners<br/>
Pussy nigga never been the shotta<br/>
When I hit you with the semi, you gon' think <br/>
that he was coming through the twitter how they screaming who shot ya<br/>
Plenty loot<br/>
Car full of goons, serving bullet wounds<br/>
My young nigga shoot<br/>
Rob yo main bitch for them Jimmy Choos<br/>
Who ya tryna fool<br/>
Chill with the act, my nigga be you<br/>
Strapped in yo Instagram pics but that don’t mean shit, what’s a gun if it ain’t being used<br/>
Lurking on these streets, in these traps<br/>
Niggas better be strapped<br/>
Niggas out here plotting on ya, be prepared to dump back<br/>
Whoop a nigga, gotta murk em payback it's closed curtains<br/>
Yeen bout that life, my nigga hollow points’ll have your soul searching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
All this cash, ain't counterfeit<br/>
But some of you niggas act counterfeit<br/>
Nigga you ain't never put in work, and quit lying ya ain't never seen pounds of it<br/>
Tired of the bullshit talking<br/>
Knowing it isn't really but you claiming that ya balling<br/>
Tried to take mine, choppa get it straight like orthodontists<br/>
I check these niggas like direct deposits<br/>
You ain't know that's how it is out here<br/>
Blood sweats and tears out here<br/>
You don't know how it feels out here<br/>
Pussy nigga you can get killed out here<br/>
My nigga that's how it goes<br/>
We so cut throat for the dope<br/>
Moving work in the hood, but ya never know<br/>
Caught a nigga with the salt, thought that shit was blow<br/>
Niggas kept ending the discussion, don't wanna talk<br/>
Hit em with the choppa, make em do somersault<br/>
Hit em with the sack, and nah ain't no running off<br/>
Everyday that bullet touching is coming off<br/>
APB, they be looking for them all mothafucking day<br/>
Homicide unit, said must be foul, mothafucking play<br/>
<br/>
