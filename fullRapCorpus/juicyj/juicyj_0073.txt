<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Man this trippy stick's some fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
If it ain't kush, it won't touch my lighter<br/>
I only smoke that shit that get me higher (and higher, and higher, higher)<br/>
If it ain't drank, it ain't in my cup<br/>
Gotta be that purple and yellow, I be turnin' up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I stay, I stay high as fuck<br/>
Pour me up some more Pimp C<br/>
Laid back with your girlfriend<br/>
She ride my dick like a GMC<br/>
Everyday I turn up<br/>
Burnin' green and sippin' lean<br/>
Codeine and Promethazine<br/>
My money longer than a limousine<br/>
Bitch bow down and kiss the ring<br/>
I count more cash than a money machine<br/>
I'm so dope in that Rolls Royce<br/>
You can park my shit on a triple beam<br/>
Squeaky queen, thousand dollar belt<br/>
Thousand dollar shoes, thousand dollar jeans<br/>
Juicy J so fresh to death, I hop out and I kill the scene<br/>
Real goons on my team, this black truck got an army in it<br/>
This the trippy life, my double cup got Barney in it<br/>
And the hoes here and I'm tryna fuck<br/>
Your baby mama is not a ten but when I'm drunk she close enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Shine so hard, you need shades<br/>
I been up for three days<br/>
I live that shit that I say<br/>
I'm getting stoned, out on stage<br/>
Take a groupie, go berserk<br/>
I got cake, no dessert<br/>
In the game, twenty years<br/>
And I still sip that syrup<br/>
Juicy J is sick and that lean is my medicine<br/>
In the back seat of that Ghost all I see is that President<br/>
I pour lean in my lemonade and lean in my sprite<br/>
Bitch I'm getting high as fuck for the rest of my life<br/>
Bitch I live in cloud nine, prescription pills and cough syrup<br/>
Bad bitches keep rolling up, I fuck your girl til we sober up<br/>
Trippy trippy trippy, high like Bobby &amp; Whitney<br/>
I stay turnt up, I stay pourin' up, I smoke more weed than a hippy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x]</i><br/>
I smoke more weed than a hippy, I smoke more weed than a hippy<br/>
I smoke more weed, I smoke more weed, I smoke more weed than a hippy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
