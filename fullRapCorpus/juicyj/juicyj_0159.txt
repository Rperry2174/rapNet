Nigga my pockets on lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
Nigga my pockets on lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
Nigga my trap house a condo<br/>
I used to live in a bando<br/>
Now I look like I just hit the lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
<br/>
We trappin' out feelings<br/>
We hop out on bitches and Bentleys and Benzes we trappin' out<br/>
They say I'm worth like a couple of milli<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
When you get up in them millions<br/>
They gettin' them feelings you might have to cross 'em out<br/>
Nowaday it ain't nothin' to talk about<br/>
Live the rest of your life in a coffin now<br/>
I used to trap on the block<br/>
That way I got me a condo<br/>
VVS cost me a lot<br/>
And my bitch is too much to handle<br/>
Niggas be in the street but they dodge us like pot holes<br/>
Talkin' like they be ridin' <i>[?]</i><br/>
Got a mexican plug, when he ship it he wrap it up just like some taco<br/>
Told him show me some love<br/>
Extra cheese on my shit, don't want no <i>[?]</i><br/>
My salsa always drippin', I'm talkin' like nachos<br/>
Nigga my pockets on lotto, I'm smokin' Gelato<br/>
<br/>
Nigga my pockets on lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
Nigga my pockets on lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
Nigga my trap house a condo<br/>
I used to live in a bando<br/>
Now I look like I just hit the lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
<br/>
Gelato in my cone, what you smokin' on?<br/>
Nigga that ain't strong, leave that shit alone<br/>
If it ain't Gelato don't call my phone<br/>
Smoke one to the dome, now I'm in the zone<br/>
Take off like I'm gone like I ain't comin' home<br/>
We cannot go, Emano Emano my pockets on lotto<br/>
I level up homie<br/>
Come getcha heat, prolly gon' slide in a <i>[?]</i><br/>
I feel like Tony Montana<br/>
Bitch I be snappin' like <i>[?]</i><br/>
You just be actin' for cameras<br/>
That's why I keep me a Canon<br/>
My pockets on auto, these bitches on lotto<br/>
I'm smokin' Gelato, I do this a lot<br/>
These bitches gon' follow the money<br/>
They know how we comin'<br/>
They see who we got in the lot<br/>
Never been worried 'bout nothin'<br/>
I know niggas bluffin' but I know that niggas gon' plot<br/>
Bitch I been livin' like Pablo, been livin' like Chapo<br/>
Before they locked 'em in a box<br/>
<br/>
Nigga my pockets on lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
Nigga my pockets on lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato<br/>
Nigga my trap house a condo<br/>
I used to live in a bando<br/>
Now I look like I just hit the lotto<br/>
I smoke a lot of Gelato
