<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
North Memphis in the buildin'<br/>
Rich niggas in the buildin'<br/>
Fired up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[August Alsina:]</i><br/>
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up<br/>
With that sweet kush, all down her back<br/>
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up<br/>
She let me hit, straight from the back<br/>
And ohh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch<br/>
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her<br/>
And ohh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch<br/>
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Fuckin' with her since a young nigga<br/>
Smokin' more weed than these young niggas<br/>
One more hit then I'm done with her<br/>
But who am I kiddin'? I'm in love with her<br/>
I'm addicted to her, she know I can't live without her<br/>
Mary Jane is all I need<br/>
In the Lambo blowin' nothin' but that kill<br/>
You know I keep this RIP<br/>
I chief and ya'll little niggas ain't in my league<br/>
I got them Kobe Bryant colors all in my weed<br/>
Pourin' up the purple plus, homie let's make a toast<br/>
Whole team doublin' up on cups of lean<br/>
Blue dream weed make my bitch go by<br/>
Got her layin' on her back, with her legs up in the sky<br/>
I'mma take me a dab and watch that ass<br/>
Stay on my triple shit nigga, I'm so high<br/>
I'm so fly, check my ride<br/>
Shit's so clean, chick thought I was a spy<br/>
007, I'm James Bond<br/>
And I'm smokin' kebowls all out my bong<br/>
All I inhale is the strong<br/>
So you know I keep the grass all in my lungs<br/>
Mrs Mary Mary, roll it back to back<br/>
On a shot of gin and a beam on my tongue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[August Alsina:]</i><br/>
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up<br/>
With that sweet kush, all down her back<br/>
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up<br/>
She let me hit, straight from the back<br/>
And ohh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch<br/>
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her<br/>
And ohh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch<br/>
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I don't smoke it if it ain't that good, nope<br/>
Fuck that nigga, I'm gravy, yeah<br/>
Fucked up nigga, I'm wavy, uh<br/>
Cotton mouth nigga, post slavery, ooh<br/>
Stop talkin' shit nigga, smoke somethin'<br/>
Girl let's bust one and roll one<br/>
Tunechi like a penny with a hole in it<br/>
Cause I don't let these bitches get they hopes up<br/>
I got Tony Montana, no cut<br/>
I gets all my drugs for free<br/>
Cause I got a bad bitch, she a nurse<br/>
And I just tell that bitch I can't sleep<br/>
I only drank on occasions<br/>
When it is not an occasion<br/>
Chinky eyes, asian persuasion<br/>
Fuck rehab, imitation<br/>
I say, "God is great, weed is good"<br/>
Amen to that shit<br/>
Rest in peace Lord Infamous<br/>
Amen to that shit<br/>
Light that ho I pass around<br/>
I hope my smoke go past the clouds<br/>
To all my homies lookin' down<br/>
Amen to that shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[August Alsina:]</i><br/>
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up<br/>
With that sweet kush, all down her back<br/>
Mrs. Mary Mack, all rolled in pack, roll up<br/>
She let me hit, straight from the back<br/>
And ohh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch<br/>
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her<br/>
And ohh, I think I love that bitch, I think I love that bitch<br/>
I think I love that bitch, I think I love her
