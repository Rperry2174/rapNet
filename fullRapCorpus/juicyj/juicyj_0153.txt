A lot of niggas can't handle the truth. They don't wanna deal with they situations in life. They wanna blame everybody else for they downfall and shit. You know how that shit go man<br/>
<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold<br/>
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold<br/>
You already know, you know how it go<br/>
<br/>
They love you when you down, they hate you when you up<br/>
Especially when you can't always help them up<br/>
Don't give out no hand outs cause' that'll mess em' up<br/>
After a while, you gon' find yourself catching up<br/>
Pay attention to the ones that imitate ya<br/>
Never fear one that try to intimidate ya<br/>
Self preservation, that's the first law of nature<br/>
They can't get none of your paper they assassinate ya<br/>
It's just a vicious cycle, look what they did to Michael<br/>
Look what they did to Martin Luther, nigga they a shoot ya<br/>
Look what they did to Malcolm X don't wanna be your idol<br/>
Just don't go against the grain this shit is suicidal<br/>
<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold<br/>
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold<br/>
You already know, you know how it go<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, so I still keep that kush lit<br/>
Real nigga, I still be on that hood shit<br/>
And I'm still sippin that good shit<br/>
Still be gettin' that money give me one reason I should quit (hell nah)<br/>
I might boss up and get mo' dough<br/>
Feeling presidential so I'm ridin' round' in that four door<br/>
Lookin' like a lick you get a couple of racks on my photo<br/>
If that bag there, then there ain't nowhere that I won't go<br/>
But everything ain't what it seem, you know what I mean<br/>
Just cause' niggas always on the scene don't mean they with the team<br/>
It started with a dream, wish you could see what I seen<br/>
Wish that I could go diamond and put it in my ring<br/>
<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold<br/>
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold<br/>
You already know, you know how it go<br/>
<br/>
Last of my kind, ain't no mo' niggas like me<br/>
Say my name around your bitch she get over excited<br/>
Give me head with no hands, hoe you know how I like it<br/>
I keep a tool with some rubbers, bitch I'm strapped like I'm ISIS<br/>
I know niggas in they feelings, meanwhile I'm in these millions<br/>
Gotta GPS my house, ain't been home in a minute<br/>
Ain't been home in like forever, I been getting to the cash<br/>
Sendin' Kate to touch the stage, pussy nigga do the math<br/>
My fingers, they itchin' for that paper like a rash<br/>
Silly bitches call me broke, must be tryna make me laugh<br/>
Niggas say I changed, if I did, why you mad?<br/>
Niggas still ain't bout' they paper gotta leave em' in the past<br/>
<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go<br/>
You know how it go, you know how it go<br/>
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold<br/>
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold<br/>
You already know, you know how it go<br/>
<br/>
