Hey you wanna get high man?<br/>
I got a joint here man, been saving this for a special occasion<br/>
<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
<br/>
THC in my DNA, Hennessey in my cup<br/>
Shell net MDMA you know what's in my blunt (What?)<br/>
Blue Dream that's what, stuffed 3.5 em' up<br/>
Money long like train smoke, my pockets like my blunts<br/>
Niggas all in my bankroll, ain't got time for no fronts<br/>
If shawty got a ass like a stripper so a nigga might tip her mane I ain't gon' front<br/>
Swear her ass so fake, ain't gotta turn around, I can see it from the front<br/>
You done seen her ass on TV nigga<br/>
I done seen that ass in 3D nigga<br/>
And there's still niggas tryna be me nigga<br/>
I been blowing gas like VP nigga<br/>
Ran out of gas on the E-Way, took a Xannie bar and some Hennessey<br/>
Talking to a bitch, catch your bitch on the other line<br/>
Probably tryna have another 3 way<br/>
She wanna do this shit again, that's a replay<br/>
Fuck her, tell her bring it back to the DJ<br/>
Go DJ<br/>
<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
<br/>
See you can't smoke this weed and you can't sip what's in my cup<br/>
Cause you ain't dope as me my nigga ain't no keeping up<br/>
I'm about to smoke as much as I can stuff a Dutch<br/>
I'm about to sip as much as I can double cup<br/>
Extensions I double up, ain't long, look like double Dutch<br/>
The moment you flooding out<br/>
Is the moment that you fucked up<br/>
I dropped the bean my lean and I'm up <i>[?]</i><br/>
You drop that lady that stuff<br/>
I got some bitches that play with their nose and they ready to party and planning to fuck<br/>
I'm tryna play with that pussy, I spit on that pussy<br/>
She making a friendly get up<br/>
I spend a day with the pussy, I pop me a molly<br/>
You ain't got no problems getting up<br/>
You gotta pay for that pussy, I lay with that pussy<br/>
And barely take her out for lunch<br/>
You tryna stay with that pussy, I play with that pussy<br/>
And never call her back for months<br/>
<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back<br/>
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back<br/>
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
