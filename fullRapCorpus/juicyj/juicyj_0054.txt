I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?<br/>
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense<br/>
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense<br/>
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch<br/>
<br/>
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?<br/>
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense<br/>
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense<br/>
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch<br/>
<br/>
These haters try to knock me but I ain't a dog<br/>
Green and white, homie I keep that 9 on me Rondo<br/>
Old player with the heat, call me Alonso<br/>
Shake a nigga dope and give a fuck if he was John Doe<br/>
Got that dirty money spreadin' around like germs<br/>
Been blowin' this money from a long turn<br/>
I'm burnin' these bitches head like a bad purr<br/>
And I've known they put their mouth a whole lot of fern<br/>
Ball in on these haters, where my toothpaste?<br/>
And when I hit the club, I'm doin' it Bombay<br/>
'Bout to run the whole game but I'm no running back<br/>
Beat a nigga so bad got him running back<br/>
<br/>
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?<br/>
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense<br/>
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense<br/>
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch<br/>
<br/>
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?<br/>
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense<br/>
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense<br/>
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch<br/>
<br/>
Head in the sky, got the booth full of clouds<br/>
Shorty come do something to make a nigga proud<br/>
Wrote a Laker in my cup, that pessa in my rap<br/>
Get around the bitch here, you know it's a rap<br/>
They swallowed my kids that's why I don't have any<br/>
If I could make 'em from the mouth I'd have plenty<br/>
Got that million dollar swag, why you haters mad?<br/>
You niggas garbage, now where's the glad bag?<br/>
I'm live on TV, you haters watchin' me<br/>
She ain't a babysitter but your bitch watchin' me<br/>
I'm a charge 'er so bad she gon call off loud<br/>
Make her ass tap out, throw in the towel<br/>
<br/>
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?<br/>
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense<br/>
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense<br/>
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch<br/>
<br/>
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?<br/>
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense<br/>
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense<br/>
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch<br/>
