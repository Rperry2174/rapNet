Hey Mike<br/>
Yeah what up?<br/>
Turn the microphone up just a little bit<br/>
This one of my favourite song right here<br/>
Had to remix this<br/>
<br/>
Murda on the beat so it's not nice<br/>
<br/>
For this life, I cannot change (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main<br/>
M&amp;M's, sweet like candy cane<br/>
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (pop it, pop it)<br/>
For this life, I cannot change (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main<br/>
M&amp;M's, sweet like candy cane (Mafia!)<br/>
Drop the top (Mafia), pop it, let it bang<br/>
<br/>
I said it can't fuck with the legacy not at all<br/>
Niggas say they finna re-up I done spent that in the mall<br/>
Even though imma stand up got niggas wanna see me fall<br/>
Like I had them niggas come collect a nigga all I gotta do is make a call<br/>
I know some bitches that be getting to it and they trap harder than y'all<br/>
Makin' summertime in the wintertime cause I know I'm hotter than 'em all<br/>
Put a hit out like the mob<br/>
Feed niggas to my dawgs<br/>
Y'all fucking' with the pigs?<br/>
Nigga we just ball hard<br/>
I can't even look at you now cause you so fake I'm appalled<br/>
Y'all making them statements so them cases gettin' sold<br/>
Gotta stay the fuck away from y'all<br/>
Y'all gettin' too involved<br/>
I know some niggas throwing rakes up, I know some niggas reppin' finball<br/>
I know some niggas puttin' cake up, I know some niggas that'd spend it all<br/>
I know some niggas that done changed up, some stay the same through it all<br/>
When <i>[?]</i> was locked up I wrote a letter to him told him we gone get it all<br/>
I ain't had nobody playing it nice it was just me and Paul (Mafia!)<br/>
<br/>
For this life, I cannot change (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main<br/>
M&amp;M's, sweet like candy cane<br/>
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (pop it, pop it)<br/>
For this life, I cannot change (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main (Yeah yeah)<br/>
M&amp;M's, sweet like candy cane<br/>
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang
