Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, got a brick in the trunk<br/>
You know I gotta get mine<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, got a brick in the trunk<br/>
You I know gotta get mine<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times,<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna sleep, never gonna fall, always on top, never gonna crawl<br/>
Keeping it moving, never on pause, picture perfect, never a flaw<br/>
Never afraid glock in my draw, making them racks, flipping them cards<br/>
Wherever yet, I stay at the bar, mafia nigga's, still in the jar<br/>
Making it rain, popping champaigne, give me the money, fuck all the fame<br/>
I be the nigga you lovin to hate when you're serious in front of them saying my name<br/>
Know you're the bitch, she giving me brain, back at the bus, back at the range<br/>
Back at my crib back at it again, but soon I as I nut she leaving my place hoe<br/>
<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, got a brick in the trunk<br/>
You I know gotta get mine<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, got a brick in the trunk<br/>
You know gotta get mine<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times,<br/>
<br/>
Selling dope ain't easy, police watching you<br/>
Nigga's don't trust nigga's everybody wanna shoot<br/>
His blood is your blood nigga's don't know what to do<br/>
Always gotta have goons everything is bullet proof<br/>
Think about your main bitch she could be somewhere telling shit<br/>
While you're at the club stuntin, feds at yo resident<br/>
But you gotta hustle bro, junkies need there medicine<br/>
Never lose a customer, keep on stacking presidents<br/>
<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, got a brick in the trunk<br/>
You I know gotta get mine<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, got a brick in the trunk<br/>
You I know gotta get mine<br/>
Mama always said<br/>
Flip that bitch a few times, a few times, a few times, a few times.
