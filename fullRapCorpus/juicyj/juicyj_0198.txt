<i>[Intro/Outro — Ty Dolla $ign &amp; Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 — Juicy J:]</i><br/>
That’s my fam, I’ll hold ‘em down forever<br/>
Us against the world, we can battle whoever<br/>
Together ain’t no way we gon' fail<br/>
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell<br/>
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar<br/>
We all want our cut like the Shredder<br/>
Me and my bros come together for the dough<br/>
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo<br/>
With the nun-chucks doors and I'm pullin' up slow<br/>
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes<br/>
Check my Rolex, it say I'm the man of the hour<br/>
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
(All for one when we fight together)<br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
(All for one when we ride together)<br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
(All for one when we fight together)<br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
(This family can bear any weather)<br/>
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 — Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Ain't nothing that could come in between me and my brothers<br/>
We all around if it's going down<br/>
It's just us, all for one, yeah you hear 'em right<br/>
Our business done, we disappear into the night<br/>
Came up together, so we all down for the fight<br/>
Ain't nothing wrong with that<br/>
Family, ain't nothing strong as that<br/>
And I'll be posted up where the strong is at<br/>
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes<br/>
That's what the people want<br/>
They ain't born, gotta create 'em<br/>
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em<br/>
That's part of the plan, by my side I'mma keep my brothers<br/>
Live or die man we need each other<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 — Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Four hitters, four winners<br/>
Tryna tell 'em you don't wanna go to war with us<br/>
We be them, we be them, young riders<br/>
Raised in the gutter, really started from the bottom<br/>
hey, we all we ever had, we all we ever needed and we undefeated<br/>
We be goin' hard, and make it look easy<br/>
Give me the whole pie, real cheesy<br/>
I told your girl no, but you might not believe me<br/>
She took a picture for me, told her smile for me<br/>
Pass her off I'm a real team player<br/>
Bandanna on my face like a gangster<br/>
<br/>
