I got details in Columbia<br/>
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh<br/>
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for<br/>
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough<br/>
<br/>
I got details in Columbia<br/>
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh<br/>
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for<br/>
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough<br/>
<br/>
Niggas tryna take mine, you blind?, you dead?, you niggas ain't hear what I said<br/>
I said nigga tryna take mine, I'll cut your hands off,<br/>
can't finger your bitch, can't beat your dick,<br/>
can't talk to the feds but a nigga like this, you crazy<br/>
I wish you knew about me, my life nigga<br/>
UFC, Juicy ain't about that life nigga<br/>
CEO, with the choppers in my desk<br/>
Niggas want a war, I got a office full of techs<br/>
A closet full of bombs, my office like the streets<br/>
Juicy J get so hot, pounds never touch my feet<br/>
I talk behind my back, to hear the realest nigga breathin'<br/>
Its always to the money where ever I put my key in<br/>
<br/>
I got details in Columbia<br/>
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh<br/>
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for<br/>
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough<br/>
<br/>
I got details in Columbia<br/>
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh<br/>
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for<br/>
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wanna be a millionaire<br/>
Till they find out I been running with the killionaires<br/>
Its contracts to get shit done<br/>
Bomb attached to get a hit done<br/>
Your life on a <i>[?]</i> I'ma load this shit up, yeah nigga I blow this much<br/>
Where your momma live, who your sister fuck, where the baby momma get paid to dick suck<br/>
Scared ass nigga with the hiccups<br/>
I'm in your rear view mirror, chillin' bruh<br/>
Starin' at your phone, knowin' its your life if you pick up<br/>
Goons at your breakfast table, I dare you to wake up<br/>
The trigger ain't got no heart, behind it ain't got no love<br/>
And I don't give a fuck, what your life we thought it was<br/>
It was just like we, when you was thought you was Noriega<br/>
I remember, any nigga can get touched, Noriega<br/>
<br/>
I got details in Columbia<br/>
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh<br/>
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for<br/>
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough<br/>
<br/>
I got details in Columbia<br/>
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh<br/>
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for<br/>
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough
