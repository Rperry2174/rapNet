<i>[Intro: Juicy J]</i><br/>

Trippy niggas... let's get ratchet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]</i><br/>
I'm loadin up and I'm ridin out, they talkin shit but they hidin out<br/>
Real niggas know what I'm talkin bout...<br/>
(I'm loadin up and I'm ridin out, they talkin shit but they hidin out)<br/>
(Real niggas know what I'm talkin bout...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
(Trippy, trippy, trippy, turn up)<br/>
Rack after rack, I got the sack, geeked up of beans, pack after pack (yeah ho)<br/>
Stay with the nina' 2 cups and a zip, Juicy don't fight I just empty them clips (yeah ho)<br/>
Blowing like cash, high off the gas, pay 20 stacks and they run up and blast (yeah ho)<br/>
Next time you're see him this face on the shirt, next time car he ride in, stretch limo hearse<br/>
See why you niggas mad nigga, that to me you so cash nigga<br/>
Stuffed in a Louie bag nigga, Juicy J be that nigga<br/>
Big bag of that stank killer, codeine in my drink killer<br/>
Mostly niggas be lyin sayin they is but ain't killers<br/>
Nigga wanna play with me, I'm a break him off<br/>
Give my youngins, they'll do it, I'm a bring em out (get em)<br/>
They gon' get on your ass then they flyin takin off (get em)<br/>
Nigga we gon take a life before we take a loss <i>[gunshot]</i><br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
My diamonds sing like Ray J homie, every day's a payday<br/>
Rollin up that KK, now it's going down like mayday<br/>
All my niggas be chilling, stacking money to the ceiling<br/>
Used to smoking out the parking lot, now we owning a building oh<br/>
Used to tell niggas I was gonna here but they ain't really understand<br/>
Now they see me in that brand new Rari and start to think I'm the man<br/>
Now my jeans cost a grand, now my shows fill the stands<br/>
Now they see that I'm ballin cause of how they bring in them bands, ooh<br/>
Now when niggas be tourin, now my money be foreign<br/>
All my niggas be scorin, section very important<br/>
I'm cakin up, you fakin up, I'm rollin weed when I'm wakin up<br/>
Instead of talkin shit and try to hate on us just grab a joint and come bake with us<br/>
(Fuck nigga, hahahaha, uhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
(Look, okay, okay)<br/>
Front page, I'm on the news: nigga call me a dropout<br/>
Real nigga, 100, never needing no copout (nah)<br/>
Diamonds on my chain just pop off, you already know what I'm bout<br/>
Got bad bitches from overseas but I need a big ass from the south<br/>
Look at us, we made it, bottles up in the air now<br/>
25 racks a night, give a fuck bout sweating your hair out<br/>
Getting trippy man with some frisky things; I am the shit and you niggas anus<br/>
'Cause if I mention ya'll I'm a make you famous you still ain't nothing, I'm stainless<br/>
We famous, anything you want right now, baby girl just name it<br/>
And I'm a get real deep in the pussy; the number one nigga, ain't no need for replacement<br/>
Getting in my spaceship, I'm high as a bitch, fly as a bitch<br/>
Okay Juicy J and Wiz, every day we do this shit<br/>
<br/>
