I drop them beans in my lean<br/>
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean<br/>
And don’t forget the green<br/>
I’m off them beans and lean<br/>
Beans and lean, beans and lean<br/>
I’m rolling up codeine<br/>
I drop them beans in my lean<br/>
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean<br/>
And don’t forget that green<br/>
I’m off them beans and lean<br/>
Beans and lean, beans and lean<br/>
I’m rolling up codeine<br/>
<br/>
Okay, them Benz gon’ make me show out<br/>
That lean gon’ make her go down<br/>
You know I bring that dough out every time I go out<br/>
You do what you know how, I do what I want now<br/>
Started up with deuces, I’m pourin’ up a fo’ now<br/>
Niggas wanna act up ‘cause I got my stack up<br/>
Three-five in my backwoods, I can smoke it backwards<br/>
Lookin’ for me after, I’m high up like a raptor<br/>
Pop so many m&amp;m’s, just call me Marshall Mathers<br/>
I don’t fuck with rappers, man, ‘cause all these niggas actors<br/>
Get the money, that’s the only way to get back at ‘em<br/>
Fuck with niggas talkin’ ‘bout it, they ain’t ‘bout the cheddar<br/>
Drop a bean up in my lean, ain’t nothing really matter<br/>
<br/>
I drop them beans in my lean<br/>
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean<br/>
And don’t forget the green<br/>
I’m off them beans and lean<br/>
Beans and lean, beans and lean<br/>
I’m rolling up codeine<br/>
I drop them beans in my lean<br/>
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean<br/>
And don’t forget that green<br/>
I’m off them beans and lean<br/>
Beans and lean, beans and lean<br/>
I’m rolling up codeine<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I can’t forget the green, all I smoke is loud now<br/>
Can’t forget the team, smokin’ Al Capone now<br/>
Weed so strong it could break a whole crowd down<br/>
Feelin' like the king and I’m looking for my crown now<br/>
Dancin’ like a stripper, she prayin’ I’m gon’ tip her<br/>
I’m smokin’ Jack The Ripper AKA the killer<br/>
Rollin’ on a hitter AKA a flipper<br/>
Codeine in my livers so she hopin’ I’mma slip up<br/>
Hopin’ she can trick me to the room ‘cause it’s a stick up<br/>
If she hit this lick then she can pay her scholarship up<br/>
All she gotta do is open up and eat this dick up<br/>
Sip that lean and take a downer, pop a bean and get up<br/>
<br/>
I drop them beans in my lean<br/>
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean<br/>
And don’t forget the green<br/>
I’m off them beans and lean<br/>
Beans and lean, beans and lean<br/>
I’m rolling up codeine<br/>
I drop them beans in my lean<br/>
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean<br/>
And don’t forget that green<br/>
I’m off them beans and lean<br/>
Beans and lean, beans and lean<br/>
I’m rolling up codeine
