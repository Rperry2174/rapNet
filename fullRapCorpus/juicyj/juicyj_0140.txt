We used to ride around in steamers man<br/>
Now we pull up back to back in Beamers man<br/>
We used to live up in the trap house<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
We used to live up in the trap house<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
I can trap out<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I push beats, yeah I push keys<br/>
I need at least 50 G's every time I touch a beat<br/>
Still use my face in the street<br/>
Still got that base in the street<br/>
I know you like the way the beat rock<br/>
That's the heat rock, no sheetrock<br/>
Ballin' out in my gymnasium<br/>
They out of bounds, I don't play with them<br/>
Acting brand new, I ain't saving them<br/>
The ones I used to dream about, I have my way with them<br/>
I'm a let 'em in the club, I'm a pay for them<br/>
Heard they wasn't doin' good, I'm a pray for them<br/>
<br/>
We used to ride around in steamers man<br/>
Now we pull up back to back in Beamers man<br/>
We used to live up in the trap house<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
We used to live up in the trap house<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
I can trap out<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
<br/>
Beamed up, fresh, clean cut<br/>
Pour the lean up, mix the beans up<br/>
Beam up, roll the dream up<br/>
She thought she saw Jesus but she saw us<br/>
Boss up, boss up, boss up<br/>
Floss up, floss up, floss up<br/>
Sauce up, sauce up, sauce up<br/>
Cough up, cough up, cough up<br/>
That's when you know you got it<br/>
All these hoes exotic, all these hoes exotic<br/>
And they fully loaded, like an automatic<br/>
What if I never got it?<br/>
Remember if it ain't 'bout dough I probably done forgot it<br/>
Don't forget<br/>
<br/>
We used to ride around in steamers man<br/>
Now we pull up back to back in Beamers man<br/>
We used to live up in the trap house<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
We used to live up in the trap house<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out<br/>
I can trap out<br/>
Now I got a mansion I can trap out
