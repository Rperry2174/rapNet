<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I'm untouchable nigga and I'm never gon' leave<br/>
None of my niggas behind, I'ma bring 'em with me<br/>
Draco sitting in the book bag<br/>
None of my niggas gotta cook crack<br/>
All my niggas litty and my bitch something to look at<br/>
Niggas hating too much<br/>
I come through I'm too clutch<br/>
A man, a man, a man all this blessings all this new love<br/>
Nigga that bounces back, they can't handle that<br/>
I got my own shooter ain't no comin' back from that<br/>
I could never fold, why would I surrender?<br/>
I got options nigga, you just a imposter nigga<br/>
You should pay attention, look at how I'm livin'<br/>
I can go spend seven figures and I wouldn't miss it<br/>
I'm just sucker free<br/>
She just love the D<br/>
She know I'm that nigga<br/>
That's all she know 'bout me<br/>
She know I keep the heater, right there on the seat<br/>
You should listen to her when she say don't fuck with me<br/>
A man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
People tryna say I'm only into me<br/>
Got a code with my dawgs, can't get in between<br/>
I can't give them life, no more energy<br/>
Man, man, a man<br/>
Spent 'bout sixty on the time, I can't even lie<br/>
No way in, no way out, this shit do or die<br/>
So I roll, when I roll, must be suicide<br/>
A man, man, man (yeah!)
