<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Rolled up with the doors up<br/>
Niggas say they everywhere, they never showed up<br/>
I'm the shit, niggas turn there nose up<br/>
I be with my bread like some cold cuts<br/>
Every time I see myself coming up<br/>
Niggas start hating, what they want from us?<br/>
I can't figure out the way they run they mouth<br/>
Niggas acting like bitches all they wear is blouse<br/>
Still pouring that purple stuff in my Fanta<br/>
Got choppers and shooters inside my phantom<br/>
Strap up if some shit jumped off then I'm bustin'<br/>
If you make it out, my nigga, you lucky<br/>
Cause I'm faded and I'm ready<br/>
And I'm strapped up about my money<br/>
And these hoes is crazy, still suck the dick after I played them<br/>
And they know I fucked them and leave them<br/>
And when I'm in public act like i don't see them*<br/>
And they still love me, when I don't feed them<br/>
These bitches is greedy give up after the genie<br/>
Ferrari switchin' roads<br/>
Faster than the money coming from the shows<br/>
Niggas know I paved the way, gave up a brick to every city<br/>
I created the flow, you niggas is New Jack City<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Throw dem racks watch how they react<br/>
Throw dem racks watch how they react<br/>
Watch them break there back<br/>
Throw that ass back<br/>
They act a fool for them damn racks<br/>
Throw dem racks watch how they react<br/>
Throw dem racks watch how they react<br/>
Watch them break there back<br/>
Throw that ass back<br/>
They act a fool for them damn racks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Look up that’s me<br/>
All the way up at the top<br/>
Maserati candy apple I just copped it fresh off the lot<br/>
My career legendary I think that they must of forgot<br/>
Still in the game on the charge while all of your artists get dropped<br/>
Niggas hatin, bitches jealous, turn my knuckles into something gross disgusting<br/>
OG puffin, too good stuff, got me buzzin, keep that new new Lauren London<br/>
Juicy J still winning still spending big or small face hunnids<br/>
In the villa with my gods bitches be hypnotized cool running<br/>
You know I’m a boss and I can put you on (x2)<br/>
Got a golf course in my backyard and I don’t play golf<br/>
Sipping Henny by the ocean smoking just like the exhaust<br/>
Hopped out, coupe running, goons on deck bout to shoot something<br/>
Fuck nigga do something, marathon clips got ya crew running<br/>
Rick James, super freak, first date, met ya bitch, dove deep<br/>
OD, wanna see, a day without racks on me<br/>
<br/>
