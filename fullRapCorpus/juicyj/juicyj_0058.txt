<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I'm a tell you broke niggas something<br/>
Listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Make money, no vacation<br/>
Pay cash don't make payments<br/>
Getting high like I'm eighteen<br/>
But I've been rich since the late eighty's<br/>
Backstage, naked ladies<br/>
Poppin pills and swallowing babies<br/>
Bad bitches ain't come to play<br/>
She gon' give me head before I go on stage<br/>
New car, a couple, a hundred<br/>
Ain't nothin' I call it play money<br/>
Bugatti, Ferrari, the Benz, the Bentley<br/>
Juicy stay stuntin<br/>
Street niggas, we packin them 2's<br/>
Play with it, make action news<br/>
Put some money on your head, you worth a stack or two<br/>
Real nigga I'm 100, I stay leanin, I chase money<br/>
Niggas out here savin hoes, niggas need to be savin money<br/>
Made mine, can't take it from me<br/>
Hit the club, I take your woman<br/>
Take her home, get some head, wake up breakfast in bed<br/>
Yeah nigga that's grits and eggs<br/>
Rich bitch don't forget the bread<br/>
Up and down that interstate<br/>
I move weight, that's Jenny Craig<br/>
I'm a fuck me a model, I'm a fuck me a model<br/>
You only get to live one time, so I'm a fuck me a model<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I make money all day then I ball with the profits<br/>
Niggas hate on me, I tell em hatin' niggas stop it<br/>
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone<br/>
Catch me on that loud pack, blowin on this strong <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Straight out of North niggas nigga<br/>
20 years in<br/>
Still rich and ain't gon stop getting rich<br/>
Told you niggas I ain't never gonna stop getting money<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bitch you ain't no killa<br/>
And real niggas don't talk<br/>
Start shit in this club<br/>
It's going down in the parking lot<br/>
Niggas get killed and then we ain't shedding no tears<br/>
Niggas can't keep they mouth closed, judge give you them years<br/>
Yo homie fuckin yo bitch<br/>
And she ain't duckin yo cock<br/>
Them noobies ain't holding you down<br/>
And you call them niggas yo dogs<br/>
They really out here hatin so stay strapped up like a tight<br/>
They got guns, they got them rubies<br/>
Except they not shootin blanks<br/>
Pass straight them, broad daylight<br/>
They don't care who lookin<br/>
Young niggas got something to prove, niggas think he pushin<br/>
Playin round in my hood and I'll smoke you like a swisha<br/>
We don't care bout money and we don't play with them pistols<br/>
<br/>
