<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yea, I tell you one time, don't play with my bread, (nope)<br/>
Nigga, you do, they gon' find yo ass dead. (yup)<br/>
Body in trunk, hands tied to yo legs, (yup)<br/>
Tape on yo mouth, a hole in yo head. (bluu!)<br/>
<br/>
Fronted some dope, now the nigga in debt, (ho!)<br/>
How you gon' pay that? Nigga don't sweat, (mmhmm)<br/>
Goons on deck - you know what's next, (what)<br/>
Send 'em to yo house, now it's time to collect, (get it)<br/>
<br/>
Now you in a box, nigga - cause and effect, (bitch!)<br/>
Hollow points and buckshots, all in yo neck. (bitch!!)<br/>
Told ya 'bout playin' with a nigga like that, (don't play!)<br/>
Now yo fam gon' visit you, payin' they respects. (you gone!)<br/>
<br/>
Tell ya one time, don't play with my money,<br/>
Sold all my dope, now you run around stuntin', (mmh)<br/>
All in the mall, spendin' money on ya woman, (trick!)<br/>
Nigga must think he don't owe me nothin', (trick!)<br/>
<br/>
Nigga must think I forgot about mine,<br/>
He pressed 'ignore' when I called his line, (hell nawh)<br/>
I'mma play it cool like everythin' fine,<br/>
Catch him comin' home, lay him down with the 9.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yo, bang bang, shoot 'em up, Memphis niggas don't give a fuck. (never)<br/>
Run up on ya in broad day, pull them guns out, shoot ya up.<br/>
<br/>
Loose ya life over light green, (uh huh)<br/>
Kill a nigga over soft white (uh huh)<br/>
You ain't from here, don't come here (nope)<br/>
And if you do, better walk light. (light!)<br/>
<br/>
Our here is a nightmare, (mare)<br/>
Homicides, not Freddy Krueger (krueger)<br/>
Niggas ain't got shit to lose, (lose)<br/>
Shoot it out like a Western movie.<br/>
<br/>
The trigger ain't got no heart,<br/>
The nigga behind it ain't got no love. (no love!)<br/>
These niggas ain't wearin' no mask<br/>
And these niggas ain't wearin' no glove (no glove!)<br/>
<br/>
These niggas don't, fight no mo',<br/>
Fuck takin' the high road.<br/>
Lil' homie 'bout 16,<br/>
Bust a gun with his eyes closed.<br/>
<br/>
Fuck with all that gangsta talk,<br/>
Know you ain't bout that life!<br/>
Pull that heater on yo ass,<br/>
Bet you come up off that ice. (ho!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
(North Memphis, North Memphis, North Memphis, North Memphis, North Memphis, North Memphis, North Memphis, North Memphis...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Project Pat]</i><br/>
Fifty shots clear this bitch out like a tornado,<br/>
Two choppas who identical - call 'em Cain and Abel.<br/>
Very fatal, dippin' in stash like a soup ladle,<br/>
Rolled up on him, shot him in his head - busted tomato.<br/>
<br/>
You niggas get high on this shit,<br/>
Like the ho, ya nuts, (okay, okay, okay)<br/>
Shotgun blast to ya stomach, bitch, on ya guts. (for real)<br/>
<br/>
You say you gang affiliated, extra clips tough, (ch ch)<br/>
And when the bullets get to poppin', they don't give no fucks (fucks)<br/>
Money rules everything, and we got the cash,<br/>
Pay yo homies one bag, (one!) to blow up yo ass (pow pow)<br/>
<br/>
Kidnap ya from ya residence, no mask no lie<br/>
F.B.I. found ya body in Project dumpster, BFI (ooooh, ooooh)
