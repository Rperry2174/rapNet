<i>[Hook - Juicy J 2x]</i><br/>
You ain't hood<br/>
You ain't gangsta<br/>
You ain't tough<br/>
You ain't street<br/>
You ain't North-North-North-North Memphis like me<br/>
You ain't ballin'<br/>
You ain't swaggin'<br/>
You ain't bangin'<br/>
You ain't street<br/>
You ain't North-North-North-North Memphis like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
We got them goons on deck, them choppas on deck<br/>
Don't violate these mafia niggas with them ho-threats<br/>
We deep off in the club, you know we smell like weed<br/>
You know we're dealing cash, you know we're selling D<br/>
You see us drankin' Goose, you see us gettin' loose<br/>
You know we ain't no cowards, you know that we'll shoot<br/>
We see you looking scared, we feel you bout to leave<br/>
You reaching in your pockets, you rambling for your keys<br/>
Somebody saw a strap, this bitch started to holla<br/>
I mugged her in her face, I hit you with a bottle<br/>
Now here come your goons, all you hear is boom<br/>
When the smoke clears, nothing but bodies in the room<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J 2x]</i><br/>
You ain't hood<br/>
You ain't gangsta<br/>
You ain't tough<br/>
You ain't street<br/>
You ain't North-North-North-North Memphis like me<br/>
You ain't ballin'<br/>
You ain't swaggin'<br/>
You ain't bangin'<br/>
You ain't street<br/>
You ain't North-North-North-North Memphis like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[V Slash]</i><br/>
You ain't tough you ain't street<br/>
How the fuck your ass hood?<br/>
I'm gangsta you ain't—<br/>
Let's get that understood<br/>
I was raised in the projects<br/>
And these niggas know that<br/>
Seven-Fo' tatted cross my chest till they blow<br/>
You ain't Nor-or-or-orth-orth Memphis like me<br/>
You ain't from the short end of hyde park like me<br/>
You ain't keep it real with your niggas, dawg, quit flaugin'<br/>
Cause nigga if you do, they will be out here starvin'<br/>
You don't fuck with Juicy 'n' Paul, and Pat like me<br/>
You ain't one to whoop that-cook that crack, nigga, like me<br/>
You ain't toss your main bitch with your clique—you a ho<br/>
Plus a character, an amateur now put that on the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J 2x]</i><br/>
You ain't hood<br/>
You ain't gangsta<br/>
You ain't tough<br/>
You ain't street<br/>
You ain't North-North-North-North Memphis like me<br/>
You ain't ballin'<br/>
You ain't swaggin'<br/>
You ain't bangin'<br/>
You ain't street<br/>
You ain't North-North-North-North Memphis like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Juicy J]</i><br/>
North Memphis... North Memphis...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat]</i><br/>
Knockin' niggas' jaws<br/>
Runnin' hoes into walls<br/>
Niggas' yelling "North, North"<br/>
All you screamin' "North, North"<br/>
The first to throw a blow<br/>
Always strapped with pistol<br/>
I'll murk one of you bastards<br/>
Don't get on that list, ho<br/>
You turned stay witness, witness how my wrist glow<br/>
I Escalade on twenty-fo's<br/>
Shows, I gets dough<br/>
They thought that was rosé, but that's really Cris, though<br/>
Don't get shot off your face, for runnin' your lips, ho<br/>
Fake niggas—Hyde Park keep them pistol grips row<br/>
You gang-bangin' hustlers just like Bloods and Crips, though<br/>
But this ain't killa Cali, but a killing's understood<br/>
If you ain't from North Memphis, then you ain't from my hood
