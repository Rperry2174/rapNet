We wanna show our love, for all the trippy chicks out there!<br/>
Rock with us!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She my good luck, she must be my lucky charm<br/>
When she's not around, got me blowin her up like she a bomb<br/>
I wrap her in my arm, every touchdown...<br/>
She my lucky charm, she my lucky charm,<br/>
I keep her by my side, cause she's my lucky charm.<br/>
She my lucky charm, she my lucky charm,<br/>
She ride when it's time to ride, she's my lucky charm!<br/>
<br/>
Scream! I think I finally got me one, this time around<br/>
I'm really feeling her, she might make me settle down!<br/>
I had to make her move, I ain't talking furniture<br/>
She's too bad, I might have to punish her!<br/>
She short and ripped, remind me of a dynamite<br/>
If looks can kill, somebody gonna die tonight.<br/>
She like to get tipsy, plus she like to smoke, too<br/>
We're looking for this type of chick, I can't believe that is true!<br/>
She got her own money, so she don't need mine<br/>
But I share it with her, cause what's hers is mine<br/>
She don't do no argue, she don't do no fussy<br/>
(Keep her!)<br/>
I think I'm about to pop the question!<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She my good luck, she must be my lucky charm<br/>
When she's not around, got me blowin her up like she a bomb<br/>
I wrap her in my arm, every touchdown...<br/>
She my lucky charm, she my lucky charm,<br/>
I keep her by my side, cause she's my lucky charm.<br/>
She my lucky charm, she my lucky charm,<br/>
She ride when it's time to ride, she's my lucky charm!
