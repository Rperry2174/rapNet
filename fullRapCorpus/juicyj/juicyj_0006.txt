<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>

Say you real, I can't tell you real, I'll put down a mil'<br/>
Talk that hit, mang I getcha mang, shoo-shoo-shoot to kill<br/>
And he trill, and he know the deal, always packin' steel<br/>
Buckin' hollows for yo' chest to swallow, fe-fe-fe-fe-feel<br/>

<i>[Verse 4: Frayser Boy]</i><br/>
Nigga let's do it, let's pursue it if you got beef with' me<br/>
Trigger molester, nigga test us, run up dogg you gon' see<br/>
Reppin' that bay, carry that K, and will let loose on you sucka's<br/>

<i>[Verse 5: DJ Paul]</i><br/>

Now it's one mo' thing I ain't gon do, and that's be hangin' round' with some foe's<br/>
I'm kickin yo' ho ass out this clique<br/>
Soon as I see yo' ass ain't shit<br/>
Punch the clock out, get yo' Glock out, we can handle this<br/>
I'm meaner than yo' regular but try to keep it cool at times<br/>
You started war with' the realest niggas, but now I'm 'bout to change yo' mind<br/>
Change yo' face, shoot at yo' place, blow you bitch into outer space<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Lord Infamous]</i><br/>
I gotta' do this shit exactly like I have it planned<br/>
I want you dead, I want you killed, yo' heart be stoppin' man<br/>
I got to spill your blood, I want to feel it in my hands<br/>
And put yo' family in body bags and drag 'em in my van<br/>
I'm gonna teach yo weak lil' bitch clique how to do a crime<br/>
I'm gonna steal, but shoot you weak fucks for a long time<br/>
That's consequences, reprocussions, fuck with' one of us<br/>
Your death is signed, sealed, delivered by the Infamous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 7: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Roll, roll, roll your dope, ridin' down the street<br/>
Choppin' up that goody-good, and smokin' hydro weed<br/>
All these sheisty coward niggas, they can't get with' me<br/>
Talkin' 'bout they pimpin', slangin', mayn nigga please<br/>
They mad because that Juicy J be on they Tele-V<br/>
And have they baby mama hollerin', cryin' on her knees<br/>
I tell ya this my nigga, that the hater pays a fee<br/>
You gonna have to pay, when ya hate on pimp Juicy<br/>
<br/>
