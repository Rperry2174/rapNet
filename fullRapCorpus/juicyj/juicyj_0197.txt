I know something you don't<br/>
That's me coming for you<br/>
You want war<br/>
We got war<br/>
We just wanna warn you<br/>
<br/>
I know something you don't<br/>
That's me coming for you<br/>
You want war<br/>
We got war<br/>
We just wanna warn you<br/>
<br/>
War for war<br/>
Bodies that hit the ground<br/>
You ready for us<br/>
'Cause it's bout to go down<br/>
Push 'em to the left<br/>
Push 'em to the right<br/>
Load the choppers up<br/>
Hit 'em on sight<br/>
Never turning back<br/>
I've done been to hell and back<br/>
Me, running out of guns?<br/>
No, never heard of that<br/>
I ain't never ran from a gunfight<br/>
This is you and me<br/>
Mano y Mano<br/>
You damn right<br/>
<br/>
Don't act like you don't know<br/>
Know what I came for<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
You take one, I take one<br/>
You can't hide, you can't run<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
<br/>
Respiratory beggin' for relief<br/>
I don't let 'em breathe<br/>
Goin' hard, I'm my own boss<br/>
Many ain't believe it<br/>
A feeling not an item<br/>
Appearing up out of thin air<br/>
Conquer everything that's in front of me<br/>
Now they under me<br/>
Rush to lead and respond<br/>
They strayed away, how a tunnel be<br/>
Took a leap of faith<br/>
Bungee cord about to give out<br/>
Nowadays whatever you say you gotta live out<br/>
Altitude have a parachute failure, we got a problem<br/>
Grow a set of wings or die when you hit the bottom<br/>
Never prayed to God, but never too late to try Him<br/>
Shots fired, Allen Iverson in the league<br/>
They say I ball hog and I'm not a part of the team<br/>
Breadwinner with these winners, built the regime<br/>
Taliban weapon in hand, kill everything<br/>
Amphetamines all for the state of a better means<br/>
I'm beautiful but known for the dope like Medellin<br/>
<br/>
Don't act like you don't know<br/>
Know what I came for<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
You take one, I take one<br/>
You can't hide, you can't run<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
<br/>
Don't act like you don't know<br/>
Know what I came for<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
You take one, I take one<br/>
You can't hide, you can't run<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
<br/>
Dress in all black like a funeral<br/>
Murder, homicide wanna ride get residuals<br/>
Layin' on fire for residuals<br/>
365 when I grind for residuals<br/>
45 Magnum in the van wit him<br/>
Ratta tatta tat I let the blam hit them<br/>
I scream fuck the whole world and put a bomb in it<br/>
Finger on the trigger, tryna put my whole arm in it<br/>
I just want revenge, I just want revenge<br/>
We get it poppin' everyday<br/>
They took away my happiness<br/>
They try to take my head away<br/>
<br/>
Don't act like you don't know<br/>
Know what I came for<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
You take one, I take one<br/>
You can't hide, you can't run<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
<br/>
Don't act like you don't know<br/>
Know what I came for<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback<br/>
You take one, I take one<br/>
You can't hide, you can't run<br/>
Too late to turn back<br/>
This is the payback
