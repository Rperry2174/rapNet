<i>[?]</i> you know damn well you ain't gon' do this shit<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
Yee ain't 'bout gun play<br/>
Maybe if you cut the acting you prolly could be one someday<br/>
Street so cold you barely can trust your bro<br/>
You are ain't no better than to trust these hoes<br/>
You think that your people got 'em, watch 'em close<br/>
Shit so bad can't dab a nigga up no more<br/>
Anytime, any place, any day, anyway I still get paid<br/>
Sellin' dimes, sellin' weight<br/>
It don't matter, get out here and get your cake<br/>
Wanna ball, better know get some dope niggas gon' try'na block<br/>
Turn up on 'em, get your money<br/>
Keep stuntin', them niggas gon' try'na swap<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

You got all that ass in them pants shawty<br/>

Juicy got a bunch of rubberbands shawty<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
<br/>
We got paper errwhere, ridin' in the rave, high as shit<br/>
Headed to the booty club, lookin' for a fly chick<br/>
50k in both my hands<br/>
I just want a private dance<br/>
She like "whatchu got to spend?"<br/>
I'm like "bitch that all depends"<br/>
Watch how hard I make it rain<br/>
Leave that pussy soakin' wet<br/>
My big faces all blue like Ben Franklin' been holdin' his breath<br/>
She know what I came to see<br/>
Suck me right, I pay them bills<br/>
Know that pussy <i>[?]</i><br/>
Wake up kick her out my hotel<br/>
You gotta get home, you can't stay<br/>
Juicy J cut her like OJ<br/>
She thought it was love, no way<br/>
Nah I ain't that nigga<br/>
Go back to that nigga that miss ya<br/>
She thought it was more than a one night stand<br/>
It's clear this bitch got issue<br/>
<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it? Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it? Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
You all on the gram with them choppas nigga<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
When shit hit the fan is you gon' pop 'em nigga?<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it? Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it? Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
You got all that ass in them pants shawty<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it?<br/>
Juicy got a bunch of rubberbands shawty<br/>
Watchu gon' do with it?
