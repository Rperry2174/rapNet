<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars<br/>
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars<br/>
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars<br/>
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars<br/>
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars<br/>
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I'm on them Xany bars my weed is medical<br/>
And I ain't had nothing to eat but some edibles<br/>
Drink alot of gin, in love with a stripper, Juicy J one crazy high ass nigga<br/>
Throwin money in the club bitches takin pictures<br/>
And we keep that MoÃ«t flowing like a Bar Mitzvah<br/>
In the bottle section bouncin on a leather couch<br/>
Money everywhere bouncin out the Louis pouch<br/>
I ain't Willy Wonka I don't sugarcoat shit<br/>
I keep codeine in my cup with a Sprite mixed<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
50 bars in a party bag, swag<br/>
And some weed from Afghanistan, swag<br/>
I'm on footballs I hit the Superbowl<br/>
And I live in a liquor store<br/>
I'm a stop buying weed, I'm a make it grow<br/>
I'm a stop burning weed, I'm a make it smoke<br/>
I ain't no medical doctor but I am self prescribed<br/>
Ain't that nigga cooking up sushi but I got the eyes<br/>
Before I hit the plane I'm already in the sky<br/>
Two weeks later, I'm still in the sky<br/>
G6 jet make, them pussys wet<br/>
Have you ever snorted Xanax some trippy shit<br/>
<br/>
