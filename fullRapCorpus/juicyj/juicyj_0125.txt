<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Must be nice<br/>
Ride fancy cars<br/>
And spend money how you wanna spend it you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Roll me up a 8th I need some inspiration<br/>
Pour me up a 8th I need some motivation<br/>
Only thing I hate bout drugs is the preparation<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I smoke everyday that's that dedication<br/>
Never sober always high that's that levitation<br/>
This shit get me where I'm going that's that transportation<br/>
Niggas try to hold me back that's that desperation<br/>
This shit go straight to my head that's that education<br/>
Niggas asking all those questions that's investigation<br/>
Wanna know my next move that's that anticipation<br/>
Had to catch that bitch off that's that cancelation<br/>
I was smoking the day I got off probation<br/>
I stay rolling up extendos bruh that's duplication<br/>
Got so much money in my pocket I'm a cash station<br/>
Got so much loud in my blunt that's a gas station<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Roll me up a 8th I need some inspiration<br/>
Pour me up a 8th I need some motivation<br/>
Only thing I hate bout drugs is the preparation<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Drinking on treys and smoking that weed but don't blaze it<br/>
Roll up a joint and just face it<br/>
I just be going trough phases<br/>
Hit your bitch all from the back while I'm pulling her braids<br/>
Nigga we famous when I walk in the club<br/>
Niggas throw the gang up<br/>
Get to this paper get her to the crib<br/>
Have relations never call her again<br/>
I just be balling my friend made my own way<br/>
Through the game cause I'm smarter than them<br/>
And I go harder than them<br/>
I knew I was great when I ain't have a dollar to spend<br/>
There go that pothead again<br/>
Can't go to the club with you less my whole squad getting in<br/>
Tattoos all over my body don't fuck with security<br/>
Know all my real niggas got me<br/>
We in the lobby, smoking that weed like I'm Marley<br/>
TM this beat is a problem, crazy to think you could stop us, and homie<br/>
We ain't got no patients cause we ain't no doctors<br/>
Used to have weed in my locker, now every bitch you see on my team is a model<br/>
Drinking it straight out the bottle, going so hard I don't think I'll wake up tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Roll me up a 8th I need some inspiration<br/>
Pour me up a 8th I need some motivation<br/>
Only thing I hate bout drugs is the preparation<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
I ain't got no patience with my medication<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I'm bout to smoke me some gas<br/>
I'm bout to roll me a zip<br/>
I'm bout to pour me some drank<br/>
Nothing less than 2 5th's<br/>
I'm bout to smack some ass, shawty gone get her a tip<br/>
I'm bout to go in my stash, I'm bout to make me some flips<br/>
Yup, roll me up some inspiration<br/>
Pour me up some motivation<br/>
Roll me up some inspiration<br/>
Pour me up some motivation<br/>
Cup full of syrup, no pancakes<br/>
Welcome to my dab game, first 48<br/>
How high can you get, I'm in outer space<br/>
All I smoke is moon rocks, and equator cake<br/>
White girl thick like mayonnaise, trippy sticking with her ass out<br/>
Dab until I pass out, gas mask dabs, Fire it up propane<br/>
Top shelf reserve, I don't smoke no name<br/>
Who got the loud pack? Who got the plug on the strong?<br/>
Smoking them cookies, I need amber glass to get on<br/>
Who smoke blunts? who smoking them papers?<br/>
Light them bitches, fuck yo neighbors!
