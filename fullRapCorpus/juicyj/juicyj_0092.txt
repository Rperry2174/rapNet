<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
My palace is taller scrapers cuz all is paper<br/>
So much green these solid acres can call it neighbors<br/>
I'm copping two of everything like Noah's Ark<br/>
I'm copping two of everything cuz I'm going hard<br/>
Spending money with no regards, pulling up with my top back<br/>
Can't find the shit that I want no more, don't have a need cuz I got that<br/>
These niggas talking millions dog but they don't see them often<br/>
I'm fresh to death, I killed the club, my section needs some coffins<br/>
My hotel we going after this club close<br/>
My hotel, you get high and ya come close<br/>
Rolling that weed up and Mike Will work that beat up<br/>
Getting drunk, getting stoned, if ya want you can meet us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
No talk, no discussion<br/>
Pull up to the club, 911 now that's stunting<br/>
And I ball so hard, I should play the whole game<br/>
Won the power of respect, get the cheque, spend the whole thang<br/>
Spend the whole thang<br/>
We ain't smoking on no hash, smoke the whole thang<br/>
Pull up to the club, 911 now that's stunting<br/>
Won the power of respect, get the cheque, spend the whole thang<br/>
<br/>
Spend it, hol' up, spend it, spend it, spend it, hol' up, hol' up, spend it<br/>
Spend it, spend it, spend it, spinach, lot of dinner dishin'<br/>
Take a cruise to Costa Rica, with my chica, let's go fishing, hol' up<br/>
50 on Venus, and Serena don't watch tennis, hol' up<br/>
That's the business, half naked models twerking in my kitchen<br/>
Fixing dinner, dinner and I'm finna, finna jump up in her<br/>
Bout the time, the time she finish sweatin, she gon' be, she gon' be thinner<br/>
Whats her, whats her name, name I don't remember, remember<br/>
Fuck it, it don't really matter, no way<br/>
We ain't got much to say, in her mouth like Colgate<br/>
Ho I'm repping Taylor Gang, bitch I smell like money<br/>
Plus marijuana, peep the aroma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Damn it I'm stunting, bitch I got money<br/>
Car ain't got no key, I just press the button<br/>
Juicy the name, all these hoes love me<br/>
My bitch got plenty ass, and got no stomach<br/>
Feed the bitch dick, she say I taste yummy<br/>
Bitch call me broke, she just being funny<br/>
So much cash can't fit in my trunk<br/>
I'm rich I can have any bitch that I want<br/>
These haters got Three 6 all in the Ipod<br/>
Filled up the club, bitch you gon' need a lifeguard<br/>
Brand new Bugatti, 280 on the dash<br/>
In the strip club break dance on that ass<br/>
All you broke niggas put your pockets in the cash<br/>
Throwing us a hunnid, broke bitch take a cab<br/>
Ain't getting money my nigga that's sad<br/>
Jack boy run up on me, I'm gonna blast<br/>
I got more game than EA Sports<br/>
Getting money all to be a sport<br/>
Disappear me and yo bitch in the back seat of my 4 on 4 Porsche<br/>
Dressed like I'm stepping in a photo shoot<br/>
You niggas all squared like a photo booth<br/>
Show y'all niggas how to get this bread<br/>
Cuz some of y'all niggas ain't got no clue<br/>
<br/>
