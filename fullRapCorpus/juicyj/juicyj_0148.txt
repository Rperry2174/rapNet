One minute nigga<br/>
I'm everywhere<br/>
I like to do this shit man, I can't help it<br/>
<br/>
One minute niggas is real, next minute niggas is fake<br/>
One minute niggas is lovin' you, next minute niggas is hatin'<br/>
One minute nigga I'm tippin', next minute nigga I'm fuckin'<br/>
One minute nigga I'm trappin', next minute nigga I'm hustlin'<br/>
One minute I'm in a Chevy, next minute I'm in a foreign<br/>
One minute I'm the hood, next minute nigga I'm tourin'<br/>
One minute I'm blowing loud, next minute I'm pouring drank<br/>
One minute I'm on the stage, next minute I'm at the bank<br/>
<br/>
One minute she want a molly, next minute she want a cup<br/>
One minute she want to party, next minute she want to fuck<br/>
I'm tired of helpin' all these niggas so they gotta figure it out<br/>
One minute I might be diggin' her, next minute kicking her out<br/>
One minute you be the man, next minute you be a fan<br/>
One minute you on the stage, next minute you in the stands<br/>
One minute you counting bags, next minute you in a Jag<br/>
One minute you got a plan, next minute you in the can<br/>
Yeah, one minute you fuckin' groupies, next minute you look like Pookie<br/>
You cannot trust all these niggas cause most of these niggas is fluky<br/>
One minute you have 'em out, next minute they run in your house<br/>
One minute you wylin' out, next minute you in a drought<br/>
<br/>
One minute niggas is real, next minute niggas is fake<br/>
One minute niggas is lovin' you, next minute niggas is hatin'<br/>
One minute nigga I'm tippin', next minute nigga I'm fuckin'<br/>
One minute nigga I'm trappin', next minute nigga I'm hustlin'<br/>
One minute I'm in a Chevy, next minute I'm in a foreign<br/>
One minute I'm the hood, next minute nigga I'm tourin'<br/>
One minute I'm blowing loud, next minute I'm pouring drank<br/>
One minute I'm on the stage, next minute I'm at the bank<br/>
<br/>
One minute they say you the best, next minute you need a vest<br/>
One minute niggas gon' hate, my nigga that's only a test<br/>
One minute they say you got it, next minute they say you average<br/>
When you stop gettin' that money them niggas don't care shit about ya<br/>
One minute you gotta get it, next minute you gotta stop<br/>
One minute they on the block, next minute they callin' the cops<br/>
One minute I get 'em in, next minute I get 'em gone<br/>
One minute niggas your friends, next minute they up in the chrome<br/>
One minute you getting money, next minute niggas is bummy<br/>
One minute niggas is thinkin', next minute niggas is dummies<br/>
One minute niggas is jackin', next minute niggas is lackin'<br/>
Remember to never be slackin' my nigga, whenever it's crackin'<br/>
<br/>
One minute niggas is real, next minute niggas is fake<br/>
One minute niggas is lovin' you, next minute niggas is hatin'<br/>
One minute nigga I'm tippin', next minute nigga I'm fuckin'<br/>
One minute nigga I'm trappin', next minute nigga I'm hustlin'<br/>
One minute I'm in a Chevy, next minute I'm in a foreign<br/>
One minute I'm the hood, next minute nigga I'm tourin'<br/>
One minute I'm blowing loud, next minute I'm pouring drank<br/>
One minute I'm on the stage, next minute I'm at the bank
