<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Winners circle<br/>
We scrapin' up all this money man<br/>
The hustle continues<br/>
<br/>
I'm feelin' faded, and elevated<br/>
Buying everything so they can tell I made it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us<br/>
I keep that money comin' in, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
<br/>
Man I'm blowing all this loud<br/>
I'll be damned to let a nigga take it<br/>
I'm a stoner wake and bake'n ain't no exit?<br/>
Plenty syrup, plenty loud, nigga you ain't heard<br/>
All this cake a nigga makin', better than desert<br/>
Keep that chopper on alert<br/>
Bombay quench my thirst<br/>
All these dead presidents I'm a need a hearse<br/>
I'm getting faded, I'm so high<br/>
Bout to spark, Captain Kirk<br/>
Wastin' weed, in my lap, tryna roll up but I swerve<br/>
You say you not sucking dick, bitch you got some nerve<br/>
Put this condom on your ear hoe fuck what you heard<br/>
I'm the shit, you just a turd, you ain't shit mark my words<br/>
Got bitches who give me brain 'til I'm a nerd<br/>
<br/>
I'm feelin' faded, and elevated<br/>
Buying everything so they can tell I made it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us<br/>
I keep that money comin' in, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
They try to talk about me cause I'm always staying positive<br/>
Ridin' clean she wakin' up and cleanin' that's just how I live<br/>
Niggas busy stressin', I'm just smokin' weed and takin' shots<br/>
Gotta keep the proper medication cause I think a lot<br/>
Fresh out the jacuzzi smokin' doobies in my Ksubis<br/>
Face time her bring her to the trap to watch some movies<br/>
Netflix, champagne, Apple TV<br/>
Best believe its going down, you fuckin' with a, G<br/>
<br/>

I'm feelin' faded, and elevated<br/>
Buying everything so they can tell I made it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us<br/>
I keep that money comin' in, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat:]</i><br/>
Scrape it up, scoop it up<br/>
We just tryna pile it up<br/>
Buying drugs where I'm from<br/>
You might get fucked like a slut<br/>
Medical cali in my lungs, hustlers hold them rollies up<br/>
Gas get in my pockets fat, stuffed like a stromboli bruh<br/>
In the club sparkles on them bottles like fourth of July<br/>
Bookin' shows all the way to Mississipi all the way to the Dubai<br/>
Rollin papers smokin' like a hippie brains in the sky<br/>
Rari light, police ask me questions know I'm a lie<br/>
Cause I'm 100 like a Calico<br/>
Cigarillo full of medical<br/>
You know wheels off the credit bro<br/>
We poppin' bottles and we stackin' dough<br/>
<br/>

I'm feelin' faded, and elevated<br/>
Buying everything so they can tell I made it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us<br/>
I keep that money comin' in, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it<br/>
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded<br/>
I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it, I'm a scrape it
