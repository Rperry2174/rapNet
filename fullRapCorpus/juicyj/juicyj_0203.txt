And I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly<br/>
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high<br/>
I say I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly<br/>
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high<br/>
That's cuz I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
<br/>
Silly bitch, stop tellin' 'em lies, hoes, stop spittin' 'em rumours<br/>
Juicy J, self made skinny nigga, pockets on Yokozuna<br/>
She wanna ride like Yokohomas, she fine like Pocahontas<br/>
I just might slide off in her with no jimmy, I'm just bein' honest<br/>
Still count up trigonomics, still got heat, you doubt us<br/>
Fuck around gets you a coozy ass casket playin' 'round with my commas<br/>
America KKK most wanted, need to free all my homies<br/>
X-ray vision in this crooked ass business, I can see most y'all niggas phony<br/>
I'm with someone else wife, I tell the driver bring the car around<br/>
Beat the pussy like Iron Mike, bang, bang, bang, bang, lights out<br/>
Blowin' on presidential, 'bout to pull up at my white house<br/>
You at home, tryna hit her phone, she got my wifebeater on as a nightgown<br/>
<br/>
And I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly<br/>
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high<br/>
I say I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly<br/>
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high<br/>
That's cuz I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
<br/>
She full of that cheap vodka, bitch hairy like Chewbacca<br/>
She got the nerve to be boochie too? man, all these hoes do is gossip<br/>
Who'd you fuck for the red bottoms? I heard about you, you a head doctor<br/>
You just lookin' for a quick come up? I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins<br/>
I'm in a old school Dodge Charger, flyer than a Red Robbin<br/>
I got goons and I got goblins, I ball hard like Dennis Rodman<br/>
Niggas hatin' on me, what's the problem?<br/>
Is you mad cuz I run shit and y'all jogging<br/>
Is you mad, cuz I shake and bake Ricky Bobby<br/>
I'm a muthafuckin <i>[?]</i> <br/>
Comin' from a cut like a blind barber<br/>
When I drive by, my car look like a flyin' saucer<br/>
Still don't want your lady? She lucky if she even get a dime off me<br/>
It's crazy what my last 5G cost me<br/>
Sip lean in the mornin', never tried coffee<br/>
Fuck her once, kick her out, bitch, start walkin'<br/>
Gettin' paid in the bed like it's my office, that's cuz I'm<br/>
<br/>
And I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly<br/>
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high<br/>
I say I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly<br/>
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high<br/>
That's cuz I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'<br/>
I know, I know, I know you watchin'
