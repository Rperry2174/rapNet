<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
My niggas...<br/>
Wherever I go, they goin' go<br/>
My niggas...<br/>
If a hater get wrong, we goin' beat that boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Ski mask, black clothes is the work suit<br/>
40 Glocks, AKs is the work tools<br/>
Niggas slick dissin' hating, really wanna be me<br/>
Cuz I'm the realest in the game, bitch come see me<br/>
You niggas kills me on the "powder get you hyper,"<br/>
You drink that liquor then turn into the ultimate fighter<br/>
I got some young niggas that'll bend your fucking brains in<br/>
Some stupid dumb nigga wild'n out the frame man<br/>
I'm at the club with my thugs doing a rain dance<br/>
We throw up signs in the air, cuz it's gangland<br/>
We in the V.I.P. vodka drankin'<br/>
Diamonds shining eyes blinding big ring-n<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I bought a old school and put brains on the bitch<br/>
<i>[?]</i> thangs on the bitch<br/>
Nigga I'm the man, I'm the same with the whips<br/>
Your baby mama love me, she go ham on the dick<br/>
You better play dead when I send out the hit<br/>
You said you dope dealing, let's go half on a brick<br/>
A large amount of beans and a pound of the mint<br/>
A small trap house where I sell all the shit<br/>
I know what it feel like broke in the slum<br/>
Hustle til I die, I'm gonna grind til I'm done<br/>
A real hood nigga I'm gonna shine like the sun<br/>
A champ with the work, I'll sell you a crumb<br/>
A hot flatscreen and a whole lot of guns<br/>
A fine triple bitch for a whole lot of fun<br/>
Some fishscale coke you can test with your tongue<br/>
Niggas always saying, "oh shit, it's the bomb."<br/>
Still throwing sets up in the club, cracking dome-ahs<br/>
Nigga I'm a vet to the shit we be known for<br/>
Rollin on some X my nig, I'm a stoner<br/>
I keep a rusty Tech that'll keep you in a coma<br/>
<br/>
