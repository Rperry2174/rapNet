<i>[Juicy J (Wiz Khalifa):]</i><br/>
Play me some of that Abel pimpin' mane<br/>
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)<br/>
100% Juice, I made this mixtape, cause<br/>
I want my niggas to have somethin' to<br/>
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)<br/>
To get 'em some motivation<br/>
To get high to, ya know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Its too much, stupid ass shit happenin' right now mane, Its time to<br/>
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)<br/>
Just turn up mane, don't worry 'bout that shit mane<br/>
Let somebody deal with that shit<br/>
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)<br/>
Trippy niggas mane, don't stress yourself mane<br/>
You know, life is short, enjoy that shit mane while we here<br/>
Let's go my nigga, let's get it<br/>
Shut the fuck up!
