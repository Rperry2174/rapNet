<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Comin from the hood, the D-boys<br/>
Lot of superstars<br/>
Ridin 30 inches on a bucket or a new car<br/>
So flingy-flingy, so flingy<br/>
So blingy-blingy, so blingy<br/>
You see me-see me, you see me<br/>
The girls clingy, they clingy<br/>
They wanna ride with the Juice Mayn<br/>
Mister bang-bang<br/>
Ballin down the old common lane, in a Chevy thang<br/>
My car is like my wifey so I treat her with the skeeter-skeeter<br/>
Rubbers worn out, you can tell by the marriage meter<br/>
Betty-Betty McBetty, the name of my new Chevy<br/>
She snow-snow whiz-ite, the color of fish scaleys<br/>
She gotta-gotta get washed<br/>
So clean-clean, no spots<br/>
She mine til' she break down, and then I gotta tiz-oss<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]</i><br/>
Girl, girl, girl<br/>
Girl please, Chevy so high, baby do you see the trees? (Huh, huh)<br/>
Crawlin down the block, dirty shine like skeez (Huh)<br/>
Blue so sweet, Gucci Mane can roll weed (Weed)<br/>
'71 Caprice taller than my Humvee (Vee)<br/>
Fine redbone, best friend, back seat (Huh)<br/>
And now we double datin, I make 'em both date me (Me)<br/>
30 inches shinin to make you haters hate me (Huh)<br/>
Used to love my date, everybody love king (What)<br/>
Flashback, triple-gold D's, seventeens (Seventeens)<br/>
Niggas on the scene, I was just fifteen<br/>
Big car, big rims, I'm mounting<br/>
Oh somethin clean, somethin y'all might see<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Project Pat]</i><br/>
Ya boy Project Pat, awww<br/>
28 inches, aww yeah, you sittin high boo<br/>
Not a woman out here on the streets can deny you<br/>
You my boo, so I gotta keeps you lookin good<br/>
Jumped into the white leather guts, with the cherry wood<br/>
When I flex, like havin sex on a porno flic<br/>
Bought some new shoes, all chrome cause I gotta flex<br/>
Know you love Jolly-Rancher candy, I did that<br/>
I ball hard, I'm a ghetto star, we in traffic<br/>
My car is bi-sexual cause she's a ho puller<br/>
Bring that gal to daddy, baby we'a gon' do her<br/>
You da only woman that a nigga made a murk for<br/>
Blow ya like moms, I'll go out like a kick-doe<br/>
<br/>
