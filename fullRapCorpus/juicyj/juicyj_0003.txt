<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Now I ain't the one with the magic wa wa wand<br/>
but I can break a bitch for the cheese and funds<br/>
I don't have to use a gun or even make the hoe cum<br/>
if a nigga go to jail then a bitch make bond<br/>
while you shakin dat ass in the shake ja ja joint<br/>
I be sittin in the back rollin big bu bu blunts<br/>
let me know when you off to collect my money<br/>
If a nigga cant get it then a nigga will haul<br/>
Cause playas like me don't see nuttin funny<br/>
bitch betta have my mutherfuckin money<br/>
black eyes and bruisin up a face I den done it<br/>
to let her know these bonified pimps who run it<br/>
She make a G a night but she told me 200<br/>
but thats what I get fuckin wit a snow bunny<br/>
I told her like this ask dat nigga you be callin<br/>
police found a body that very next morning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 x2]</i><br/>
Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes<br/>
Like a pimp<br/>
Keep the money not folded in a roll<br/>
Like a pimp<br/>
When I see you bitch you betta have my dough<br/>
Like a pimp<br/>
Reach Back<br/>
Like a pimp<br/>
Slap Da Hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
They wanna wear my shoes they wanna wear<br/>
my clothes they wanna ride round thru the<br/>
hood with 20 hoes sittin back in the back<br/>
like a nigga suspose with a chauffer drivin<br/>
lettin his pimpin be choose<br/>
I can walk the walk and I can talk the talk<br/>
bring yo girl to my room mane thats all you saw<br/>
young nigga in the cut name Juicy J<br/>
nigga skin black as dark like ebay<br/>
All these freaks cross the world they don't want to holla<br/>
If you ain't got 20's if you aint got dollars<br/>
Bitch fuck that shit we still gon pimp<br/>
we go ride thru the streets we go hit the<br/>
dense we go smoke on dem blunts we go sip a fifth<br/>
We go stand on the corner wit a pistol grip<br/>
If you want to holla at us we ain't out for the squeeze<br/>
All we want is yo purse cause we out for the cheese<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>

<i>[La Chat]</i><br/>
