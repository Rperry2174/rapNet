<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Still winning... we gonna stay and get money<br/>
So you niggas know what it is - 4/20 bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
High... ain't no coming down<br/>
Roll up let's burn up<br/>
Turn up, ain't no turning down<br/>
Chasing this fast money, ain't no slowing down<br/>
Hold up, let's pour a four up 'cause it's going down<br/>
High... ain't no coming down<br/>
Roll up let's burn up<br/>
Turn up, ain't no turning down<br/>
Chasing this fast money, ain't no slowing down<br/>
Hold up, let's pour a four up 'cause it's going down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Break it down, roll it up<br/>
My money too long can't fold it up<br/>
Pour it up, I'm drunk as fuck<br/>
I take more alcohol than an open cut<br/>
Early morning getting to the bread<br/>
So I call it breakfast in bed<br/>
Real nigga don't believe in ghosts<br/>
But I'm still chasing these dead prez'<br/>
My eyes so low, I'm so lit<br/>
I might nod off after one more hit<br/>
In a foreign whip with a foreign bitch<br/>
I live every night like a porno flick<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe - hoe don't kill my buzz<br/>
Bitch I'm so fresh and clean, but my cup is full of mud<br/>
If she not fucking she gotta go<br/>
One monkey won't stop the show<br/>
I'm backstage with a flock of hoes<br/>
And I'm getting blowed like a snotty nose<br/>
Hollywood I'm still stuntin'<br/>
Makin' paper all around the country<br/>
I'm getting throat, fucking hoes<br/>
Getting dome and counting money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Let's blow it all, can't take it with ya<br/>
Step out my car, they takin' pictures<br/>
That's paparazzi, that's TMZ<br/>
My Mercedes Benz that's AMG<br/>
Eyes like I'm Chinese, out in Tokyo<br/>
Check my passport, homie, I do global shows<br/>
And I stay high, ain't coming down<br/>
Smoke light green, don't fuck with brown<br/>
Rollin' up that loud, your dope ain't making no sound<br/>
I roll through the 'hood in that new Bugatti Coupe<br/>
Pull up on your baby momma, she treat my dick like a flute<br/>
Juicy J kilin' the game, go ahead and buy you a suit<br/>
I spend your whole signing bonus on just one pair of shoes<br/>
Let's get high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh<br/>
Pour up a deuce<br/>
Matter of fact, make that four<br/>
Ok, now you got the juice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
And I stay high, ain't coming down<br/>
Smoke light green, don't fuck with brown<br/>
And I stay high, ain't coming down<br/>
Smoke light green, don't fuck with brown<br/>
And I stay high, ain't coming down<br/>
Smoke light green, don't fuck with brown<br/>
And I stay high, ain't coming down<br/>
Smoke light green, don't fuck with brown<br/>
High...
