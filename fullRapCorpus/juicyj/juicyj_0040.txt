Yes I'm smoking weed always pussy<br/>
Let's go<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Ride<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No Sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap<br/>
<br/>
Doping and whipping, a groupie hoe on my dick<br/>
These hoes ain't in love with me, they in love with my chips<br/>
No seat belt is strapped, but I gotta strap in my lap<br/>
Got rats comin for my cheese they gonna run across my trap<br/>
Money on your head but you ain't gonna need a cap<br/>
Put your ass to sleep, take a permanent nap<br/>
I got plenty of tools, but I don't play with them<br/>
I go to sleep with all my bitches, yeah I lay with them<br/>
Homie I'm always strapped, like a green marine<br/>
In my cup I got that lean, that's that drink<br/>
Some of my niggas trappers, some of them crooks<br/>
If you think we ain't bout to bust, you dumb as you look<br/>
<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Ride<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No Sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap<br/>
<br/>
Got nine shots now Warren Sapp<br/>
All the heroine on my block, got junkies runnin laps<br/>
We ridin round with that strap, nigga checkin traps<br/>
All these bright eyed ass niggas eatin, so we fittin snap<br/>
You gettin money, so we take yo money<br/>
Don't be lookin funny, gon spill ya onioin<br/>
Start runnin, hear that thang hummin, when you hear that thang hummin<br/>
Niggas start runnin<br/>
Ain't gon chase ya, but I'm gon get ya<br/>
Ya homeboys, they goin with ya<br/>
It's a reaction, malt liquor<br/>
Young niggas, hair triggers<br/>
Cold blood, laid his ass out<br/>
All the lil niggas on the 150, they the ones that had to clout<br/>
We the ones that had to go hard, and lay niggas head in lap<br/>
On the rap<br/>
It's time to take the cheese from the trap<br/>
<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Ride<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No Sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap<br/>
<br/>
I'm after the cheese, after the green, call it trap Kermit<br/>
Straight hoppin, pistol poppin, we ain't got no permits<br/>
Been up in here for four / five days, call me hood Hermit<br/>
Can't show no bread like Lenny on good times, had to burn him<br/>
Now it's gonna learn him, you pancake niggas mouths flippin<br/>
Banana chopper turn your niggas cherries into banana splits<br/>
Gettin head like a fitted cap, from yo baby moms<br/>
Nigga mad, now he wanna do a pimp bodily harm<br/>
Project want <i>[?]</i>, double barrel in your face<br/>
I'm on some rubber band business, Juicy J<br/>
Automatic guns, paper sacks, full of presidents<br/>
Every shell wiped off, I ain't leavin evidence<br/>
<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Yes sir<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap<br/>
I'm ridin with that package so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
Ride<br/>
I ain't tryna catch that pack so I gotta stay strapped<br/>
No Sir<br/>
With two nines to your chest, we gon call you Warren Sapp<br/>
For you rats that's tryna take cheese from the trap
