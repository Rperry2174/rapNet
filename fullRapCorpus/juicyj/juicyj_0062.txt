<i>[Intro: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yeah... yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane<br/>
Yeah... I'm 'bout to take yo' girl (bounce it)<br/>
Check it...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Trey Songz (Juicy J)]</i><br/>
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)<br/>
I’m about to throw a couple thousand (bounce it)<br/>
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)<br/>
I’m about to throw a couple thousand<br/>
(Ones, fives, tens, twenties)<br/>
(Work your way up to them big face hundreds - just bounce it)<br/>
Bounce it (bounce it), bounce it (bounce it)<br/>
I’m about to throw a couple thousand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yessir...<br/>
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands<br/>
Grabbin' ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man<br/>
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinking different (different)<br/>
Clap that ass, light our blunt, baby, let’s get ig'nant (ig'nant)<br/>
She’s strips with the Gs, breaks cash like Li, she got double Ds, and ain’t shit free<br/>
Came with my goons but I’m leaving with a diva with an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah<br/>
Redbone in some red bottoms, she ain’t finished college, she a head doctor<br/>
Bouncing ass while I’m getting high as propellers on a helicopter<br/>
Let’s do it again, me, you and your friend<br/>
We don’t even need a room, give me head up in my Benz<br/>
Where my double cup, time to pour it up<br/>
Got a bitch so bad you can’t afford to fuck<br/>
Bounce it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Wale though, le'go...<br/>
Hands is on her you know what, ’cause bandz a make her you know what<br/>
And I can make a girl break fast, my pants be on that too much lust<br/>
And I’m ’bout whatever baby, take a photo, I’m looking good<br/>
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you’re misunderstood<br/>
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it<br/>
All of these pussy niggas, only under influenced<br/>
Throw a block up then I back out, like that, roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap<br/>
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack, and a bucket but we nothing but pack<br/>
Bald-headed scallywag, real niggas salute me<br/>
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy<br/>
Or Marc Gasol, or Selby do, that’s plenty dough<br/>
That’s Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those<br/>
Ralph!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Turn up...<br/>
Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy, toss up that cash and she show me her kitty<br/>
Got some white girl and a white girl, doin' a tiny line off of her titty<br/>
Ain’t tryna fuck, I just found a replacement, feelin' so global, I think I need agent<br/>
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt, I’m tryna get head while smoking a blunt<br/>
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up, I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck<br/>
Along came Molly, then came Doobie, then codeine in a styrofoam cup<br/>
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin', do it real good, might take you shoppin'<br/>
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket, keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking<br/>
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress<br/>
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest<br/>
I don’t buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check<br/>
Working for that money, bitch, you gon’ have to break a sweat<br/>
Bounce it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz]</i><br/>
...I’m about to throw a couple thousand<br/>
...I’m about to throw a couple thousand
