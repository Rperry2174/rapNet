<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
Thumbin' through so much money, thumbin' through so much money, thumbin' through so much money, that I need three hands to count it<br/>
Thumbin' through so much money, so, s-so much money, thumbin' through so much money that I need three hands to count it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I woke up in a Bugatti, and parked it by my Ferrari<br/>
Took my Rolex and chopped it and stuffed it in my Buggari<br/>
I got your bitch on a Molly, she ride me like a Ducati<br/>
If giving head was a college, she would be summa cum laude<br/>
She treat my dick like a pistol, I treat her face like a target<br/>
I told em "Bandz A Make Her Dance," I turned my head, that shit charted<br/>
Black matte Aston Martin, my hood gives Koopsta apartments<br/>
Lambo didn't come with no key, I push a button to start it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Say Juicy J must know magic, all these invisible sets<br/>
I put kush in my lungs and leather seats in my jet<br/>
I got a gold-plated toilet, my nigga, I'm rich as shit<br/>
And I would carry a wallet but all my money won't fit<br/>
I drop the bag in Miami, and Ferragamo'd my bitch<br/>
A couple of bands for her heels, a couple more for her tits<br/>
Bitch I got money and shooters don't make me pay for the hit<br/>
They wipe your ass off the planet like you ain't never exist<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm countin' so much money, dollar signs all I see<br/>
I might go buy me an island and fly your bitch to my D<br/>
I got that old school Chevy with crocodile on my seat<br/>
And I still run with them wolves, yeah bitch I'm a beast<br/>
I spent the rack 'fore I knew it, and that was just on my feet<br/>
This bitch is stupid as fuck but on that Molly she geek<br/>
She like "It's Christmas in May", I'm 'bout to roll up a wreath<br/>
And I'm so cold on these hoes but I still carry that heat<br/>
<br/>
