Get up, get up, get up<br/>
Get up, get up, get up bitch, get up<br/>
Get up, get up, get up bitch, get up<br/>
Get up, get up, get up bitch, get up<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, I got a lot on my mind<br/>
So I'm just tryna have a good time<br/>
Roll sum'n smoke sum'n one time<br/>
And I ain't tryna waste no time<br/>
Ay, I'm just tryna have a good time<br/>
And I ain't tryna waste no time<br/>
I ain't tryna wait in no line<br/>
Cause I ain't tryna waste no time<br/>
<br/>
Yeah nigga<br/>
I brought all this money out the club to fuck it up<br/>
I can't even lie, all the bitches wanna fuck with us<br/>
I just bought like thirty bottles, but there's not enough<br/>
Nigga thinkin he can ball with me, I gotta call his bluff<br/>
I get it bustin soon as I step foot off in the party<br/>
Ain't no talkin we bout action we gon get it started<br/>
Pay attention, I'm a show you how to really party<br/>
Cause ain't no question, I'm the realest nigga here regardless<br/>
I pull up, hop out, and I tell the valet keep it close<br/>
That's a half a mil I'm whippin I ain't mean to boast<br/>
Maison Margielas, Versace, yeah I do the most<br/>
She asked my why I go so hard, I told her she should know that...<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, I got a lot on my mind<br/>
So I'm just tryna have a good time<br/>
Roll sum'n smoke sum'n one time<br/>
And I ain't tryna waste no time<br/>
Ay, I'm just tryna have a good time<br/>
And I ain't tryna waste no time<br/>
I ain't tryna wait in no line (no line)<br/>
Cause I ain't tryna waste no time, no time<br/>
<br/>
Ain't got not time to waste, cause I ain't tryna wait<br/>
I'm feelin good so I might smoke me like a pound a day<br/>
You catch me up in the party, it's goin down today<br/>
I'm usually drinkin Bombay, but I'm drinkin brown today<br/>
I got my Rollie on, I got the ring to match<br/>
Smokin Illuminati, you never seen this pack<br/>
I get so high, I feel like I'm never coming back<br/>
If you looking for me, I be where it's bustin at<br/>
I'm with my nigga G-O, you know he keep some freak hoes<br/>
I swear to God this shit to easy, it feel like a free-throw<br/>
I'm with my nigga Wiz, you know we handle biz<br/>
Ain't fuckin with you fraud niggas cause you counterfeit<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, I got a lot on my mind<br/>
So I'm just tryna have a good time<br/>
Roll sum'n smoke sum'n one time<br/>
And I ain't tryna waste no time (hell naw)<br/>
Ay, I'm just tryna have a good time (hey, hey)<br/>
And I ain't tryna waste no time<br/>
I ain't tryna wait in no line (ay, ay)<br/>
Cause I ain't tryna waste no time, no time (ay, ay)<br/>
<br/>
We gon' go to every club in Sri Lanka<br/>
We gon' lit them motherfuckers up!<br/>
You hear me right, nigga? UP!<br/>
That's all we thinkin, goin by the word "up"<br/>
It's time to celebrate<br/>
We made it<br/>
Yeah, yeah
