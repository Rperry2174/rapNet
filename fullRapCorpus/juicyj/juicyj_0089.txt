<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Fuck a nigga, that goes to anybody<br/>
Fuck a ho, these hoes anybody<br/>
I'll up that strap on anybody<br/>
I'm getting bread, you can ask anybody<br/>
<br/>
Grab a bitch by the neck<br/>
Say bitch can ya suck a dick<br/>
Niggas talk behind my back<br/>
I can get you for a cheque<br/>
If I don't fuck with you niggas, that ain't never gonna change<br/>
I'm a trill OG, don't associate with no lames<br/>
I got drugs all in my system, put slugs all in yo frame<br/>
Respect this or get a death wish, or don't give a fuck about fame<br/>
Cuz I started watching niggas get paper<br/>
I came up and I turned the tables<br/>
See my money is like now and laters<br/>
I'm getting paid right now and later<br/>
I blow more grass than a gardener<br/>
Save the bullshit for a farmer<br/>
I woke up and bought a Fisker, call that good karma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Swimming in dough, drowning in ounce<br/>
I take yo ho, drive around in my Benz<br/>
Its a photo, so she brung her friends<br/>
3am now I'm swimming it in<br/>
You a bitch and you know it, that's why you hate on my grind<br/>
And you know I'm winning and you can't deny<br/>
Say you not eating my nigga, you on a no money diet<br/>
You wan't a problem take mine, I'll gun you down if you try<br/>
Bulletproof vests, we dressing for war cuz we know whats next<br/>
Better be strapped, if ya don't react, put a bulls eye down on yo hat<br/>
You can die in yo tracks, see if yo homeboy got yo back<br/>
Niggas these choppas full and these bullets hungry and you look just like a snag<br/>
<br/>
