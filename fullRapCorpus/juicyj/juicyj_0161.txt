<i>[Project Pat:]</i><br/>
Pat'aaaahh!<br/>
Mayne you niggas know what it is<br/>
Nigga you didn't hear the motherfuckin' choppa?<br/>
You niggas don't gonna do nothin' but curl up like a motherfuckin' beetle bug, kna'msayen?<br/>
Like a roly poly nigga. Yee ain't do shit, get your monkey ass out the way. Get your ass murked!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down<br/>
You gon' lay it down<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
Get yo head down, get yo head down<br/>
Get yo head down<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down<br/>
You gon' lay it down<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
Get yo head down, get yo head down<br/>
Get yo head down<br/>
<br/>
My lil homie keep a choppa on 'em<br/>
17, he already got some bodies on 'em<br/>
He ran off on his plug, hit the lotto on 'em<br/>
You can't tell a nigga shit, you can't stop the homie<br/>
Now he out here like he can't be touched<br/>
He the youngest nigga out here buying bottles in the club<br/>
Throwing money on the strippers<br/>
If he fight, he pull them pistols<br/>
On a hand full of drugs with a whole gang of niggas<br/>
Living so fast, don't get in his way<br/>
He ain't even 18, got 2 babies on the way<br/>
They say lil homie got the juice, that's the word around town<br/>
Caught him coming out the barber shop, the plug hunt him down<br/>
<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down<br/>
You gon' lay it down<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
Get yo head down, get yo head down<br/>
Get yo head down<br/>
<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down<br/>
You gon' lay it down<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
Get yo head down, get yo head down<br/>
Get yo head down<br/>
<br/>
You ain't got nothing for me<br/>
You don't get nothing for free<br/>
Choppa just like the police<br/>
Imagine what I do with beef<br/>
Catch<br/>
Pick him right out of my teeth<br/>
My niggas is eating with me<br/>
They off the leash, you dealing with beasts<br/>
You say it's a struggle to you, really it's nothing to me<br/>
Bitches be fucking for free<br/>
Falling in love with the d<br/>
Falling in love with the fact all for nothing and nothing is fucking with me<br/>
Bullets gon' grind you, don't never say nothing and be right back out on the street<br/>
Came here from nothing to something, if you don't want nothing, your nothing to me<br/>
Plus I got nothing but love for the millions, the niggas who hating on me<br/>
Hop in my whip and pull off on niggas, my bitches is waiting on me<br/>
I got them choppas for niggas who thinking that they wanna take some from me<br/>
<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down<br/>
You gon' lay it down<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
Get yo head down, get yo head down<br/>
Get yo head down<br/>
<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down<br/>
You gon' lay it down<br/>
When you hear that choppa<br/>
Get yo head down, get yo head down<br/>
Get yo head down
