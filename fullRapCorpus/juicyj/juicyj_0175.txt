I'm always high, I'm always drunk getting too fucked up<br/>
That's why we gotta roll one up<br/>

Getting too damn stoned<br/>
I roll too much weed to smoke on my own<br/>
That's why we gotta roll one up<br/>

I ain't got no job, smoke weed at the job<br/>
Most niggas gotta rob cause the<br/>
(President don't fuck with us, that's why we gotta roll one up)<br/>
Smoking weed with your broad<br/>
In her panties, in her bra tryna get a nigga hard<br/>
(I just hit her base like a baseball game<br/>
Your bitch ridin' now she ain't yours mane)<br/>
I ain't got no plans, you can bring your friends they can all join in<br/>
(I got girls rollin up what they came here for, smoke so much till I can't no more)<br/>
I ain't worried about 12, I can make me a sale<br/>
Ain't gotta send it through the mail<br/>
Cause (it's legal now so the plants gon' grow<br/>
OG Kush got me movin' slow<br/>
Let me hit that bong<br/>
We don't smoke that mid, only smoke that strong)<br/>
If it ain't that dope, don't roll it up<br/>
And you already know what's in my cup<br/>
Finna (roll a paperplane)<br/>
Smoke green suicide, yeah I got my own strain<br/>
And if it ain't Green Sui', then you know it's KK<br/>
Don't fuck up my high, don't fuck up my day<br/>

Smoke so much that I'm in the stars)<br/>
Just smoked out the Mulsanne<br/>
I smoke more than you move them thangs<br/>
And my (eyes so low, I'm in my zone<br/>
Too damn high, man don't hit my phone)<br/>
Cause you already know what I'm on<br/>
Bout to break me down a pound and roll up a zone, nigga<br/>
