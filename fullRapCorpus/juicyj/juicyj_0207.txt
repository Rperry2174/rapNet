<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
My mansion sittin' on 40 acres<br/>
Who da neighbors?<br/>
Kobe Bryant from the Lakers<br/>
Now that's paper<br/>
Kobe Bryant from the Lakers<br/>
Now that's paper<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
Big cribs lot of cars and enormenous prices<br/>
I don't tell you what I spend but my blood might<br/>
Get money, get pussy, smoking weed forever<br/>
Rub that money in my palms cause it grease better<br/>
Whole real estate came with a lot of zeros<br/>
(How you do that mayne?)<br/>
Sold to a lot of people, over 30 million souls, that's a lot of people<br/>
Now I got a big crib that fit a lot of people<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Straight from the projects now I run Maserati<br/>
The life of a mob nigga I think I'm John Gotti<br/>
They feed me proof I buy what I chose<br/>
I take 40 racks, I throw it out and I'm cool<br/>
Got all thirsty bitches think I am going pay 'em<br/>
You think you care but money you gets nay<br/>
No need for wristband the owner know who I am<br/>
Ten bottles of Rose two models on both hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <i>[Repeat]</i>
