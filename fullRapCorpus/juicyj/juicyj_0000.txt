<i>[Juicy J: spoken]</i><br/>
Yes sir, once again it's on<br/>
Juicy J featuring Project Pat<br/>
Chronicles of the Juiceman<br/>
North, North Part 2<br/>
Raise your thumbs up, my nigg<br/>
It's on, fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
North, raise your thumbs up nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
North, north in this thang<br/>
And you know we running thangs<br/>
Everybody raise your thumbs<br/>
Everybody show your gangs<br/>
March in a circle man<br/>
Muscle up until you strain<br/>
Project Pat and Juicy J them niggas <br/>
With them gold fangs<br/>
Yes we keep the lightest dope<br/>
Yeah we has the freakest hoes<br/>
Then we ride to Evergreen<br/>
On the block is where we post<br/>
Policeman can't stop this<br/>
I think they ought to stop it<br/>
I'm talking in that ghetto English<br/>
Saying fucking bastards<br/>
Gangsta, niggas walk up in the club<br/>
High as hell, because we full of drugs<br/>
What gang you claim, the way they wear them hats<br/>
Don't get too close, be careful we be strapped<br/>
We put it on the map<br/>
We keep out cheese in flaps<br/>
And if you see me in the hood<br/>
You better give me dap<br/>
I'm known as a veteran<br/>
My picture should be stamped<br/>
From Smoky City to Hollywood, they wild over there, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat:]</i><br/>
If you ain't from my hood<br/>
You can get the hell from 'round here<br/>
Cause me gon' smoke hydro<br/>
And we gon' drank beer<br/>
It ain't no mu'fuckin secret<br/>
Cause we some thugs<br/>
It ain't hard for you to peep it<br/>
We sellin drugs<br/>
So don't you cowards step wrong<br/>
Smith and Wess-on<br/>
These automatics have ya ass singing a different song<br/>
A mega blast from these rocks get the track jumpin<br/>
A North Memphis nigga sell dope or taking something<br/>
Your car bumpin', riding clean and you seeming bold<br/>
And now you wonder why we kicking in your back door<br/>
This ain't no suburb, my nigg this the ghetto<br/>
And you gon' come through flossin like a pretty ho<br/>
A no no, for you off turn-em-on niggas<br/>
Show some love or you will meet then chrome triggers<br/>
We smoking buds, sippin sizerp and poppin pills<br/>
Gimme some work, come on through<br/>
We got the best deals<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I done lived in the North, 'round the way<br/>
I done planted playa seeds in the motherfucking bay<br/>
Hypnotize is the label that you don't wanna hate<br/>
I done seen niggas make it<br/>
I done seen niggas break<br/>
Brothers on the same block till his hair turn gray<br/>
Stilll all about a hustle, punch a clock, no way<br/>
The police hit the block, swallow rocks, throw the hay<br/>
Back in the same spot, the next fuckin' day<br/>
Project Pat, what's up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Project Pat:]</i><br/>
Jimmy, Jimmy coco puff<br/>
You know how we roll<br/>
Niggas is gone get shot up<br/>
Trippin with this North<br/>
Ride up beside ya, dawg<br/>
Pullin up them Yorks<br/>
Squeeze on them triggers<br/>
Empty clips and reload<br/>
If'n you got beef, my nigga<br/>
You better bring it<br/>
The hood buck is here<br/>
The police couldn't tame it<br/>
Inhalin' potent trees<br/>
Something you can't hang with<br/>
Hydro wit' red hairs<br/>
Something I can slang wit'<br/>
<br/>
