My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, she go low<br/>
My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, used to tell her what you said, bro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Me, Juicy J, got too many hoes<br/>
Me, Juicy J, got too many flows<br/>
Clique ballin' out like the '98 Lakers<br/>
Pull up in a million dollar car and violate it<br/>
Fly to Cancun on Sunday, land in France on Monday<br/>
Faded at the fashion show, tryna grab a bitch off the runway<br/>
I ain't even pack no clothes, nothin' but rubbers in my suitcase<br/>
Laid her on the mic, menage with my model and her roommate<br/>
And if I tip a bitch, we fuckin', it ain't no discussion<br/>
It cost to be the boss, my nigga you way outta your budget<br/>
Who you playin' with lil homie? Your life won't cost me nothin'<br/>
Juicy J so presidential, don't make me press that button<br/>
<br/>
My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, she go low<br/>
My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, she go low, low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Young Thug]</i><br/>
I get a brick, you know I get it for the, low<br/>
Her ass so fat, I told her drop it down, low<br/>
I do a verse, you know my prices ain't, low<br/>
LilÂ¡ momma know I like my kisses down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Me, Nicki M, I got too many wins<br/>
Pull up with them V twins in my engine<br/>
All this ice all around me like a penguin<br/>
I ain't talkin' bowlin' but I'm with the kingpin<br/>
I pull up with a nigga with a real big dick<br/>
That's shit so good, man a bitch came quick<br/>
I ain't ever have a beat that a bitch ain't rip<br/>
I'm fly every day but a bitch ain't trippin'<br/>
You be on that bull, you be on Scott Pippen<br/>
I be pimp walkin', I'm limpin'<br/>
C's on my bag so they think I'm crippin'<br/>
Every nigga in here wanna know what I'm drinkin'<br/>
Myx Moscato, niggas<br/>
I keep a pillow with me just because I'm tired of niggas<br/>
I'm with some flawless girls, they're pretty and they're thick<br/>
Bust it open quick, put that pussy on his lips, bitch<br/>
<br/>
My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, she go low<br/>
My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, she go low, low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Young Thug]</i><br/>
I get a brick, you know I get it for the, low<br/>
Her ass so fat, I told her drop it down, low<br/>
I do a verse, you know my prices ain't, low<br/>
Lil' momma know I like my kisses down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Bibby:]</i><br/>
I'm Lil Bibby, Mr. Everything-For-The-Low<br/>
Mr. Leave-Her-At-Home-He'll-Take-Your-Ho<br/>
Mr. Stack-That-Dough<br/>
Young rich nigga used to trap by the store, now taxed for the flow<br/>
Tell a rap nigga, "I'm not feelin' you"<br/>
Stop frontin', boy, y'all not criminals<br/>
At the top, man they talkin' 'bout killin' you<br/>
Got two 9's but they're not identical<br/>
I'll never trait on my squad, nigga<br/>
Ball hard, nigga, I'm Michael Jordan, you Lebron, nigga<br/>
In other words, you a fraud, nigga<br/>
I'll pull your card, nigga<br/>
I'm a young boss, I'm runnin' shit<br/>
Call me King Tut, all this gold on, I be blinged up<br/>
If they try to rob, got the things tucked, you ain't seen nothin'<br/>
At the club, their jaws drop when I pull up in that Benz<br/>
30 deep, 'bout 20 heats, still stomp him out with my Timbs<br/>
I'm in here chillin' with my feet up<br/>
I told y'all that I'm 'bout to heat up<br/>
Man it's time to kill all this weak stuff<br/>
Pull the beat up, watch me eat up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, she go low<br/>
My beat low<br/>
My bass low<br/>
I ride low, she go low, low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Young Thug]</i><br/>
I get a brick, you know I get it for the, low<br/>
Her ass so fat, I told her drop it down, low<br/>
I do a verse, you know my prices ain't, low<br/>
Lil' momma know I like my kisses down
