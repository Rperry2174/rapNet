<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh<br/>
Nigga, I got the black card, finna swipe this shit<br/>
<br/>
This that higher level stunting, make it rain a lot of hundreds<br/>
Gave that chick 30k to go get rid of her stomach<br/>
I'm a triple OG nigga 20 years and running<br/>
All my niggas down to ride like crash test dummies<br/>
And J don't stand in line, I ain't never never had to wait<br/>
I'm the realest in this game, I ain't never had to fake<br/>
Forgiatos on the classic like that bitch got on some skates<br/>
Having dinner with Obama smelling like a pound of hay<br/>
I might blow a pound a day, smoking KK like a hippie<br/>
In the 60's with this chick, tryna give my dick a hickey<br/>
Had to get it out the mud, no wonder why I'm filthy rich<br/>
And I'm running through this money like it don't mean nothing to me, I might<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing<br/>
Bitch I'll buy 20 bottles at the club like it ain't nothing<br/>
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing<br/>
Bitch I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing<br/>
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing<br/>
Bitch I'll go and buy a cougar bad bitch like it ain't nothing<br/>
Pull a hundred hoes, man it ain't nothing<br/>
When you getting money, smashin', she don't say nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Pull up in the lowrider two hoes behind us<br/>
Police say that they can smell it but I make sure they don't find it<br/>
Hit the corner, slide the ash, Young Khalifa bout his cash<br/>
'Bout to build another whip and I ain't even got to brag<br/>
Three women got that bitch leanin'<br/>
Young Khalifa got the women screamin'<br/>
Done deal, done deal<br/>
When I pull up, It's a done deal<br/>
Lift the trunk, still rolling up<br/>
And I got one in the front, two in the back<br/>
Do what I want, a nigga be like<br/>
King of my city, I'm living to show 'em<br/>
I cannot be even, three wheelin' in traffic<br/>
This '61 I'm building 'bout to be a classic<br/>
I'm repping Taylor Gang - they asking; paper or plastic?<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
(Yeah, Ey Mike-Will, I got <i>[?]</i>, check this out)<br/>
Getting paid like ghost do<br/>
In the street, in the club too<br/>
Designer everything, Ric Flair<br/>
I can buy the rap game, brick fair<br/>
Buy the bar, smoke that caviar, I'm in the finest car<br/>
Push to start, I glow in the dark, I run up the charts<br/>
Redbone, vanilla, freaky broad, she gon' keep me hard<br/>
Black car, better play it smart, nigga we in charge<br/>
Get paid, young nigga get paid<br/>
And I run the game like a fucking arcade<br/>
If we talking money then I got a raise<br/>
Drink so strong, they think I got it laced<br/>
