<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got frenemies<br/>
Got a lot of frenemies<br/>
Got so many people tryna drain me off this energy<br/>
Tryna take away from a nigga<br/>
Playing with the money, pray for these nigga's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Drop a bitch at the mall, tell her buy what she want<br/>
I got a condo, I only spent a night in it once<br/>
Rappers talking sideways in their interviews<br/>
They just tryna stay on flow like a in a tube<br/>
I might drop a mixtape cause I'm in the mood<br/>
Probably get my dick sucked<br/>
What you mad at a nigga for, I don't get it<br/>
Your running out of time lil homie, the clock ticking<br/>
I think I want a r&amp;b girl tonight<br/>
I'm a that's a early flight<br/>
Red light special and your chick get served<br/>
Sign on the door say do not disturb<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got frenemies<br/>
Got a lot of frenemies<br/>
Got a lot people tryna drain me off this energy<br/>
Tryna take away from a nigga<br/>
Playing with the bread, pray for a nigga, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Nigga you don't want no problems with me<br/>
I put money on your head that's a hobby to me<br/>
I pull up and fill the hotel lobby with freaks<br/>
Your girl sneaking out the crib just to party with me<br/>
Last night I met a thottie with a college degree<br/>
So I let her give me braing, said she smarter than me<br/>
What you mad at a nigga for, I don't get it<br/>
I could trade in my Ferrari for a hundred Honda Civic's<br/>
And get one of them bitches to, all of my bitches then<br/>
Put that shit on Twitter for ya, just to say I did it, hollup<br/>
Champagne for my guest<br/>
DJ Khalid on the speakerphone, tell em we the best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - until the end:]</i><br/>
Smoking energy<br/>
Smoking on some energy
