Yo, you know, on some real shit, ummm... you know niggas I fuck with man, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
They don't rap man, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
They don't do none of that shit man, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Them niggas ain't even be at my shows and shit you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Them niggas be busy as hell man. That's street life nigga, real shit<br/>
<br/>
My homeboys ain't no rappers, they ain't singin' songs<br/>
Put me in your rhymes, they gone show up at your home<br/>
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
My homebodys ain't no rappers<br/>
They not doin' shows<br/>
They not in no videos<br/>
They too busy movin' dope<br/>
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
<br/>
My little partner he's so with it, he don't take no pictures<br/>
Ain't no photos just that .44, he go everywhere with it<br/>
Now this is real life, he knee deep in that white<br/>
I hear takin' <i>[?]</i> they ain't doin' it for likes<br/>
Gotta meet in person to discuss this feature price<br/>
He get 25 years if they catch him on the mic<br/>
Nigga ain't no Source awards, ain't no MTV jams<br/>
Just a nigga in the trap with that sack, flippin' yams<br/>
Pockets XXL and extended magazines<br/>
Ain't no magazine cover, they just dodgin' undercovers<br/>
Go head, put me in your rhymes, let's see how that turn out<br/>
My little nigga hear that record then go see what you about<br/>
<br/>
My homeboys ain't no rappers, they ain't singin' songs<br/>
Put me in your rhymes, they gone show up at your home<br/>
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
My homebodys ain't no rappers<br/>
They not doin' shows<br/>
They not in no videos<br/>
They too busy movin' dope<br/>
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Herb:]</i><br/>
I always wasn't a rapper, I was born a stacker<br/>
Coulda been a trapper, helped me get richer<br/>
Shouldn't have been a clapper, RIP my niggas<br/>
Double cups and handles, I don't fuck with liquor<br/>
Real street nigga, I don't diss niggas<br/>
Fuck the internet, we gone get niggas<br/>
Niggas want the fame, I ain't into that<br/>
Switch up on his homies when he get a check<br/>
<br/>
I'm just gettin' paid, I don't sneak diss<br/>
I just keep it G on some street shit<br/>
Teachers told me I ain't gone be shit<br/>
I got rich and it ain't no secret<br/>
I'm the wrong nigga to hold beef with<br/>
Send 'em goons out to delete shit<br/>
They don't give a fuck, they just hit you up<br/>
Fuck this rap shit, ain't no back and forth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Herb:]</i><br/>
Losin' your respect, I'mma keep mines<br/>
Fuck a peace sign, I throw up my set<br/>
Out the city now cause my city dry<br/>
But on the east side we leave niggas wet<br/>
Ninas, .40s, Tecs<br/>
Pull up on your block, leave your body stretched<br/>
Anybody next<br/>
You that nigga? I'm that nigga, been that nigga<br/>
You'se a copy cat, no one honours that<br/>
<br/>
We get straight to it, we don't talk it out<br/>
Pull up to your house, catch you walkin' out<br/>
Let that gun go at your front door<br/>
It's a gun show and you got front row<br/>
Tried to warn you though<br/>
You don't listen though<br/>
Now you bleedin' out on your kitchen floor<br/>
Get you murk'd off for that shit you wrote<br/>
Now that's what I call a killer flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Herb:]</i><br/>
Rappers wearin' wires, where the water at?<br/>
Niggas snitchin', he said where your honor at?<br/>
Young boy, I be where your momma at<br/>
Load the llamas up, where the drama at?<br/>
Bitches wanna fuck me now I'm popular<br/>
Niggas hatin' on me for a lot of stuff<br/>
So every time I move you know I got the tool<br/>
30 shots to her, stand on top of ya<br/>
<br/>
You ain't livin' them punch lines<br/>
You fantasizin', you day dreamin'<br/>
You make believe, don't play with me<br/>
Cause I pull up on you 'bout 80 deep<br/>
Memphis Tennessee, we ain't bluffin' bitch<br/>
Stripper bitch might set ya up<br/>
We might book you for a concert<br/>
Make you come to town just to wet you up<br/>
<br/>
My homeboys ain't no rappers<br/>
They too busy movin' dope<br/>
Movin' dope, busy movin' dope<br/>
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope<br/>
They too busy movin' dope<br/>
Movin' dope<br/>
They too busy movin' dope<br/>
They too busy movin' dope
