Uh huh<br/>
Ya boy Juicy J<br/>
Yo, I had to make this song for the beautiful ones<br/>
Cause it seem like all the time<br/>
The beautiful ones be the most thirsty<br/>
<br/>
This is for the thoooooots<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me<br/>
This is for the thoooooots<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me<br/>
This is for the thoooooots (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
This is for the thoooooots (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
<br/>
Look at her bank account, shawty ain't got a dime<br/>
She only get out of bed so she can twerk on vine<br/>
Time to go get some money baby, don't care if you're popular<br/>
She think she a model cause she got 3000 followers<br/>
But that don't pay yo bills<br/>
That won't feed yo kids<br/>
In the club every night, you think that's where she lives<br/>
Leave the kids with her mama, while she go around the corner<br/>
She gon buss it wide open then come home without a token<br/>
Got her legs wide open, got yo nose wide open<br/>
Tryin'a come from like she something, homeboy you must be jokin<br/>
She not worth it, she been up and down the block<br/>
Lil shawty ain't a wifey, now that's what'cha call a THOT<br/>
<br/>
This is for the thoooooots<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me<br/>
This is for the thoooooots<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me<br/>
This is for the thoooooots (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
This is for the thoooooots (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
<br/>
She a freak, so you know she got some freak friends<br/>
Need a babysitter every single weekend<br/>
I know you know the type<br/>
So caught up in the hype<br/>
Want a man that got his own, meanwhile they sharin tights<br/>
They at all the after parties, fuckin all the bald playas<br/>
Girl them pussy walls dead, you gon need a pall burial<br/>
But them niggas be thirsty, they be gassin you up<br/>
All them real niggas lookin at you laughin it up<br/>
I hope you wrappin it up, give that pussy a break<br/>
All them niggas you fuckin, you never been on a date!?<br/>
Baby you know who you are, it's written all over your face<br/>
Take a look in the mirror, point the finger and say<br/>
<br/>
This is for the thoooooots<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me<br/>
This is for the thoooooots<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me<br/>
This is for the thoooooots (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
This is for the thoooooots (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
Thirsty ass hoes on me (T-H-O-T, T-H-O-T)<br/>
<br/>
The beautiful ones<br/>
I'ma toast up right now<br/>
I got some champagne<br/>
I'ma toast up for all the beautiful ones<br/>
Cause those the real thirsty ones<br/>
So my nigga, make sure you wrap it up<br/>
And don't give these freaks all yo money<br/>
Cause they gon take it...<br/>
And spend it with another nigga<br/>
Let's go!
