<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
If I ain't in the Phantom, I'm probably in a tank<br/>
Catch me overseas, flock of bitches blowing dank<br/>
I'm where you ain't<br/>
I'm coping everything that you can't<br/>
Get your pockets up, big bank take lil bank<br/>
Big bank take lil bank, big bank take lil bank<br/>
I'm on a spree fucking bitches, big bank take lil bank<br/>
Big bank take lil bank, big bank take lil bank<br/>
I'm with the movie stars trippy, big bank take lil bank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I'm forever gone ball<br/>
And I'm telling you dog<br/>
If I'm not in the lab, then I'm fucking up the mall<br/>
At the car lot, fuck swapping out<br/>
I loved everything there, so I had to buy 'em out<br/>
Riding round the city, they know it's me<br/>
Parera hanging out the window, hard not to notice me<br/>
Big bands my convo<br/>
Need all that like pronto<br/>
Get money with, my eyes closed<br/>
Got a condo with a lot of hoes<br/>
My ice is like a freezer, Evel Knievel<br/>
Shouts to Bombezel, doing something illegal<br/>
Love making money and I do it for the people<br/>
Ball on 'em once, now here go the sequel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Key]</i><br/>
Trynna make 'em understand<br/>
Gotta make 'em understand<br/>
I said that money ain't a thing<br/>
I ride around in them Prada frames<br/>
I ride around and I take your dames<br/>
Since he got money, he ain't been the same<br/>
My denim cost, and they denim plain<br/>
While you copin' halves, we got 10 of them things<br/>
Duffel bag like a gymnast mane, deep off in your girl<br/>
Said I pray to God for my sins and <i>[?]</i><br/>
Thank you Jesus like amen<br/>
8 million, 8 million, flippin bitches at the Days Inn<br/>
That Cali Kush is so amazing<br/>
That Kickstand, I'm so faded<br/>
My lighter lit, my blunt blazing<br/>
I'm coming down and them niggas hating<br/>
Gotta go and get it, I'm money crazy<br/>
Go and get it, I'm money crazy<br/>
Big bank said it's taking little bank<br/>
Said I'm probably at your girls' house, twisting up and blowing stank<br/>
<br/>
