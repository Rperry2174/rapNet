<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah, ice<br/>
(Mike Will Made It)<br/>
So much ice, so much ice<br/>
Your boy Juicy J, let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Time to hit the club, throw on my ice<br/>
Anyone get wronged, put 'em on ice<br/>
10 bottles of the Ace, sittin' on ice<br/>
Actavis with Jolly Ranchers, pour it over ice<br/>
Ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice<br/>
Ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Ballin' like a fadeaway, my money don't fadeaway<br/>
I wake up, roll one up, brush my teeth, then go get paid<br/>
Let's go get this money homie, ain't no way around it<br/>
Keep them fuck niggas from around me<br/>
I go in like I'm grounded<br/>
I'm a rich nigga homie, I don't give a damn<br/>
Nigga run up on me, he a dead man<br/>
Spend the night with somebody wife in a suite<br/>
Got a thot pussy poppin' in a handstand<br/>
Style on my ace of spades, come here little momma, have a sip<br/>
Juicy J sold dope, they tryna ban a nigga like Actavis<br/>
I don't fuck with none of ya'll niggas, like an activist<br/>
I be gettin' bent behind tent, like a campin' trip<br/>
Brown skin, caramel, shawty just my eye candy<br/>
I got so much ice on, I could sink the Titanic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Future:]</i><br/>
I was runnin' from the police when I dropped my dough<br/>
I almost gave out of breath but I didn't lose hope<br/>
I got 350 dimes, I sell 'em two for one<br/>
I'm trappin' every single day because I gotta make money<br/>
And if a nigga get caught, bitch I'm goin' on the run<br/>
I had to learn about that fork and ever since I was stuntin'<br/>
They say the undercovers 'round here tryna catch me with somethin'<br/>
I heard they ran up in my homies spot and found all the guns<br/>
(We bought the AR's with the nuts on 'em<br/>
Them chops go blat-blat-blat-dat-dat-dat<br/>
When it's necessary put a nigga on ice like Ben and Jerry's<br/>
Quarter million worth of of real ice<br/>
Cause me and my niggas got merit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - A$AP Ferg:]</i><br/>
So icy! Like Jeezy &amp; Gucci<br/>
Low fade like Boosie<br/>
Spit crack like Pookie<br/>
All for the love of the coochie<br/>
Fuck them Friday through Tuesday<br/>
Hit the highway with the Kool-Aid<br/>
Smile, I'm in love with that booty<br/>
I'm in love with the music, that's why I do it<br/>
High off the stupid flow, I use it and abuse it<br/>
Half rappers is foolish, they take your brain and pollute it<br/>
I Street Fightered a ho, I take your brain and I duke it<br/>
I take her brain and I do it, I fucked your dame and you knew it<br/>
Got the fame off this crew shit<br/>
You couldn't last on this cruise ship<br/>
Couldn't last with this flow<br/>
I was different on this one<br/>
I got hundreds or more<br/>
Wait until you hear my new shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J]</i>
