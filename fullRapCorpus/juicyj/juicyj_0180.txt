That's cash, nigga, I got bundles of it<br/>
You don't like it, but these bitches love it<br/>
If money ain't the topic, no discussion<br/>
I'mma need you broke niggas to change the subject<br/>
Niggas mad cause they see me stuntin'<br/>
Bet you hide when you see an OG coming<br/>
Catch me in the whip that I do about 200<br/>
In a whole month like I'm TV Johnny<br/>
Homie, I've been doing this shit, I'm a vet in this<br/>
Shit, you little niggas need to catch up<br/>
That Ferrari out there so fast it can fly<br/>
So sick it need a check up<br/>
Niggas went down when the chips wasn't low<br/>
Now they think I owe them something<br/>
Same niggas who was talking down on me<br/>
Want me to throw 'em something<br/>
Motherfucker, I walk up in the club then show out<br/>
Po' more out, you tripping if you bring your ho out<br/>
I throw dough out<br/>
Ain't nothing changed but my change and my chains and I'm ballin'<br/>
Numbers on the board, look like a blow out<br/>
Came this far all on my own<br/>
Hit after hit, now I'm in my zone<br/>
Bitch, I topped the charts <i>[?]</i><br/>
Now the Billboard's my second home (ballin')<br/>
<br/>
Blow out - ballin' <i>[8x]</i><br/>
Just bought a cemetery (blow out- ballin')<br/>
They killing niggas all day (blow out- ballin')<br/>
Just put a million on the Lakers (blow out- ballin')<br/>
And I ain't ever at the games (blow out- ballin')<br/>
Smoking weed with a politician (blow out- ballin')<br/>
The nigga wearing my chains (blow out- ballin')<br/>
We go to dinner every night, celebrate (blow out- ballin')<br/>
Tip a hundred racks to the waitress (blow out- ballin')<br/>
<br/>
Living in the clouds, but I still see clear<br/>
Motherfuckers hate the fact that we still here<br/>
I tour all year, if it's cash then I'm all ear<br/>
Same team, different state, feeling like my peers<br/>
I'm the star here, making toast, burning bread, nigga<br/>
My new gold chain exciting the feds, nigga<br/>
Got it on my own, never had to beg, nigga<br/>
Now everything Louie, Gucci in the mass, nigga<br/>
Still rolling up fresh out of the pound, nigga<br/>
Fly in your bitch then hit the town with her<br/>
You know Juicy the type to po' up, roll up a swisher then I get her high<br/>
Ain't no coming down, nigga, hash all in my rillo<br/>
My eyes in the red zone, but nah I ain't touchdown<br/>
Hoes used to flex on me<br/>
Now they do anything just to get me to cuff now<br/>
Only rock the finest shit<br/>
Closet filled with designer shit<br/>
All this ice in my rollie<br/>
I can't even see what time it is<br/>
I be thumbing through a check, bruh<br/>
Watch the Louie V store on Rodeo get shut down<br/>
Hit you niggas with the tech, bruh<br/>
Taking shots from the free throw line, but it ain't no fouls (ballin')<br/>
<br/>
Blow out - ballin' <i>[8x]</i><br/>
I'm allergic to these broke niggas (blow out- ballin')<br/>
So I went and bought a plane (blow out- ballin')<br/>
Duffle with Columbians (blow out- ballin')<br/>
While you niggas cutting cake (blow out- ballin')<br/>
I'm Russia buying diamonds (blow out- ballin')<br/>
While you niggas buying chains (blow out- ballin')<br/>
Your wife say "Juicy, when y'all fucking?" (blow out- ballin')<br/>
Get used to my name (blow out- ballin')<br/>
<br/>
Your wife say "Juicy, when y'all fucking?"<br/>
Get used to my name
