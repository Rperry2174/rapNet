<i>[Intro x4]</i><br/>
Get your money, get your money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Say you need some extra cash to pay for college with<br/>
And it just so happens I got a lot of it<br/>
Spin around the pole while you're doing splits<br/>
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
You a college chick, you a college chick<br/>
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship<br/>
You a college chick, you a college chick<br/>
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship<br/>
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick<br/>
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick<br/>
You a college chick, you a college chick<br/>
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Clap that ass, just like the clapper<br/>
All these bands now these bitches wanna fuck with rappers<br/>
I got my Ghost outside, I call it Casper<br/>
Ain't no nigga fly as Juicy J, ask NASA<br/>
Show me some, I might owe you some<br/>
Them bands waiting and I know you want 'em<br/>
I'm tryna pay your student loans<br/>
Fuck your boyfriend, I want your number<br/>
Let me get that becky while I'm rolling up<br/>
Send my watch back to my jeweler, it ain't cold enough<br/>
Just a bunch of bad college chicks in the W with no clothes on<br/>
Trippy cup in my hand in the bathtub with my robe on<br/>
Tell all your girlfriend that I'm breaking bread and down to fuck<br/>
One night, fuck a wife, trippy niggas never cuff<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]</i><br/>
Well fuck her master, she got her bachelor<br/>
So she only fucking rappers, she tired of cappers<br/>
And she only shake for backups, so shake it faster<br/>
It gets better every chapter, spit that Project Patta<br/>
(She call me master!)<br/>
Money, money, money while she grindin' on the pole<br/>
Dollar for a show but don't nobody gotta know<br/>
(Get it, get it off the floor)<br/>
She shakin' it like she strippin'<br/>
She only representin' for her bitches out in Memphis<br/>
Hol' up, hol' up wait a minute, I just came to my senses<br/>
I'm trippin' if I'm trickin' if I'm paying your tuition<br/>
Cause you know a couple principles or pals in your division<br/>
Pay attention, how I'm livin', bet you hate it like detention<br/>
Motherfucker...<br/>
<br/>
