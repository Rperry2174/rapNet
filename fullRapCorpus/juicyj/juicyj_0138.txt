<i>[Juicy J &amp; Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
One thing niggas on, hand me my chrome<br/>
Goin back to snatching niggas out they Cadillac and send them home<br/>
Smoke em' like a bong, then its back to counting money when I'm stoned<br/>
Or I send a hit through the phone and my dudes will come get you and they'll never leave you alone<br/>
My niggas official like refs with a whistle, I just make one call back to top off your dome<br/>
Off with your head, bitch I'm a king I got shooters with 2's protecting my throne<br/>
One shot then you gone, you should've known. I'm a real nigga I cannot be cloned<br/>
I'm filthy rich still don't let a penny go<br/>
I be up all night like I'm Arsenio<br/>
Freaky bitches take the dick in any whole<br/>
Now they famous cause they in my video<br/>
Who you foolin' I don't buy<br/>
I don't judge I just go off vibes<br/>
When I touch the sky then hop in this ride<br/>
Taylor Gang nigga we don't die<br/>
This world is mine I delete you guys<br/>
We all tryna eat we don't need your kind<br/>
And get that cash but family first<br/>
Be prepared to grind nigga put in work<br/>
Fuck nigga what would you do for this ice<br/>
You think its really worth losing your life<br/>
How bad you want stripes, my young niggas killers<br/>
If I give the word then they smashing you niggas<br/>
Bunch of youngins' coming from a broken home<br/>
Slanging rock n roll but ain't no rolling stone<br/>
Streets welcome niggas in with open arms<br/>
If I catch the charge I'm a post a bond<br/>
You god damn right I'm a certified boss I can cut the check or I can cut your throat<br/>
Put you on the table tag on your toe smoking weed till' I overdose<br/>
You don't want beef you ain't thinking clear. I'm too busy tryna make a fucking village<br/>
Dripping more cheese then a chicken Philly, Pittsburgh niggas really bout they business<br/>
I got niggas with me don't got any feelings<br/>
They just really wit it, they just into killing<br/>
Hard as hell on the internet but nigga in the streets you like Richard Simmons<br/>
My money long and my passport got more stamps then a nigga mail<br/>
It ain't a problem if I catch a body then I'm heading over seas I'll never see a sail nigga!<br/>
MAFIA<br/>
GANG!
