Before I start my day, you know I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Before I make a play, you know I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Before I pull up on your baby mama, I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
'fore I step in Benihana's, I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Right before I pin the corner, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
<br/>
KK got my mind blown, roll up with a blindfold<br/>
Police jump behind me, I'm like OJ in that bronco<br/>
I just get my grind on, High-Tech in my styrofoam<br/>
Famous bitches sendin' naked pictures to my iPhone<br/>
I prefer the papers, get that pilin' hot off vapers<br/>
I might smoke an acre of a couple different flavors<br/>
Ride my Mercede, piss-pissin' off the neighbors<br/>
I'm just gettin' money so I don't get why they hatin'<br/>
Before I deal with all this bullshit, I gotta get high<br/>
Chasin' money homie, I can't leave a dollar behind<br/>
If you chase that money too, then we got a lot in common<br/>
I be smokin' more Os while I'm stackin' up my commas<br/>
<br/>
Before I start my day, you know I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Before I make a play, you know I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Before I pull up on your baby mama, I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
'fore I step in Benihana's, I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Right before I pin the corner, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
(Lex Luger!)<br/>
<br/>
I spend the weekend at Frollies, kickin' it, tippin' some strippers<br/>
I got a headace, she gave me head, now I feel a lot better<br/>
I drink it straight from the bottle, I shoot it right off the hip<br/>
Stuff a Moonrock in the ground, 'bout to roll up a rocketship<br/>
I gotta take that bitch on knockin' her off, now my dick gone<br/>
Take a few shots to the dome, she say that she love me, then she poppin' <i>[?]</i><br/>
Might get us something to eat, later though, we probably drivin' <i>[?]</i><br/>
Drivin' our foreign machine with the bitches thinkin' it's government cheese<br/>
Shinin' like a diamond, struntin' like <i>[?]</i><br/>
You know that Juicy stack more paper than a three ring binder<br/>
All day long I'm grind, only way we eat<br/>
And I don't get no sleep unless on that lean<br/>
<br/>
Before I start my day, you know I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Before I make a play, you know I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Before I pull up on your baby mama, I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
'fore I step in Benihana's, I gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Right before I pin the corner, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
Gotta touch the sky first, gotta touch the sky first<br/>
<br/>
Moonrocks, Hi-Tech<br/>
Get the weed, where my X, bitch?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron<br/>
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more<br/>
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron<br/>
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more<br/>
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron<br/>
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more<br/>
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron<br/>
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
