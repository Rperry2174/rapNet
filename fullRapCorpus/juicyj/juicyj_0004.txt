Killa Klan <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<i>[Chorus: Killa Klan Repeated]</i> North Memphis, South Memphis, ATL, Chicago<br/>
<i>[cities differ for each chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Late last nite, I was in the bed, eyes red<br/>
Thinkin' about project pat, and what the fuckin jury said<br/>
Givin' him what they gave him, then they put him in handcuffs<br/>
Motherfuck dem laws, I'ma make you put yo hands up<br/>
Don't cross the line, yellow take the police brand up<br/>
Outside the court, Norf Memphis and we klanned up<br/>
I can be a leader, bring the heata, like a farakhan<br/>
I can be a terroist to the government like a taliban<br/>
Long as ya black, and ya wrist they put they targets on<br/>
Watchin' niggas every move, tappin' niggas cell phones<br/>
Don't, Fall, for the okay, Don't, Call, and I'll bring the dope<br/>
And we gon' smoke we till the break of dawn<br/>
Trapped in this hood where there ain't no motherfuckin bon<br/>
And to that officer I know your stompin' ground here<br/>
But If you ain't from my hood, get yo ass from round here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Crunchy Blac]</i><br/>
First I'm gonna catch the bitch<br/>
Then I'm gonna beat the bitch<br/>
Then I'm gonna bury bitch<br/>
Shouldn't of been talkin' shit<br/>
You knew who you was fuckin wit<br/>
Fuckin wit the fuckin best<br/>
She who you fuckin been<br/>
Now I'm aimin' at yo chest<br/>
This goes out to all of y'all<br/>
All of y'all be talkin' shit<br/>
Slip the clip up in the gun<br/>
Then commence to bust a nig<br/>
Bust a nig, at ya dawg<br/>
Watchin' you niggas fall<br/>
Screamin' out like a bitch<br/>
Mane that's just some petty shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lord Infamous]</i><br/>
I'm into blood baths, I don't, fine I'll punch ya<br/>
I'ma hit yo ass wit the fuckin rocket launcher<br/>
Can you stand the pain, insane, bounty hunta<br/>
Stop long, see ya pulp, till ya unconscious<br/>
Throw you in the dumpsta, lord catch a conquer<br/>
Lord don't, pistol play jump up, if ya want ta<br/>
This is the unda, buried by yo momma<br/>
Not only do I murder mane I also am bomb ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Picture this, you a juror and you on the stand<br/>
And you about the judge the life of a black man<br/>
Young brotha from the hood made it rappin' and<br/>
Wit a knot in his pocket weighin least a grand<br/>
Here's the story he got caught wit some fire arms<br/>
By a crooked ass cop wit his siren awn<br/>
He was known as a felon made it bigga than state<br/>
The whole case turned fed made him lose his faith<br/>
Picture this, now the judge he got hatred for crooks<br/>
Because ten years ago he was appointed by bush<br/>
Republican white man, and he don't give a fuck<br/>
If the guns wasn't his that was found in his truck<br/>
Prosecutors, shady lawyers, mane who can you trust<br/>
All this palm greasy shit, mane it's bigga than us<br/>
Make you wanna be like fuck it hit the trunk of the car<br/>
Deliberation it was time for the jury to star<br/>
<br/>
