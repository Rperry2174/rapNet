I done teamed up like goddamn<br/>
Got these hoes like goddamn<br/>
All these ice that I'm rockin'<br/>
Got a nigga like goddamn<br/>
Like the city of goddamn<br/>
Fresh as hell like goddamn<br/>
<br/>
I done teamed up like goddamn<br/>
Got these hoes like goddamn<br/>
All these ice that I'm rockin'<br/>
Got a nigga like goddamn<br/>
Like the city of goddamn<br/>
Fresh as hell like goddamn<br/>
<br/>
All these goons and these goblins<br/>
They don't care about nothin'<br/>
Bitch you suckin' and fuckin'<br/>
After that you get nothin'<br/>
After that you get nothin'<br/>
Ain't no kissin' and huggin'<br/>
Ain't no lovin' and dovin'<br/>
No no no no<br/>
I'm constantly stackin' this dough<br/>
You could be here with me <i>[?]</i> these benefits if you wasn't such a hoe<br/>
Pimpin' ain't dead, it's just niggas that scared<br/>
Lemme show you how I go<br/>
I give out line after line after line after line like a nigga out here with the blow<br/>
Switchin' lanes like I'm switchin' the flow<br/>
Give me brain, put the stick in her throat<br/>
And this chain cost a brick of the coke<br/>
All these rings cost a brick of the coke<br/>
You out of your mind, must be goin' insane<br/>
See we not the same, come from different cloth<br/>
Ain't talkin' 'bout planes, I'm takin' off<br/>
But when we on the plane she take it off<br/>
Ayyy<br/>
<br/>
I done teamed up like goddamn<br/>
Got these hoes like goddamn<br/>
All these ice that I'm rockin'<br/>
Got a nigga like goddamn<br/>
Like the city of goddamn<br/>
Fresh as hell like goddamn<br/>
<br/>
I done teamed up like goddamn<br/>
Got these hoes like goddamn<br/>
All these ice that I'm rockin'<br/>
Got a nigga like goddamn<br/>
Like the city of goddamn<br/>
Fresh as hell like goddamn<br/>
<br/>
Got the whole city rockin'<br/>
Got the whole club poppin'<br/>
12's in my trunk knockin'<br/>
Heard them niggas been plottin' (fuck them niggas mayne)<br/>
You signed to me you ain't floppin'<br/>
Your album comin', it's droppin'<br/>
Ace of Spades what we poppin'<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
300000 for that drop in<br/>
Half the time I don't hop in<br/>
Half the time I just cop it<br/>
Just cause it's on the margain<br/>
My girl say I need to stop it<br/>
But she gon' fuck 'soon as I park it<br/>
<br/>
I done teamed up like goddamn<br/>
Got these hoes like goddamn<br/>
All these ice that I'm rockin'<br/>
Got a nigga like goddamn<br/>
Like the city of goddamn<br/>
Fresh as hell like goddamn<br/>
<br/>
I done teamed up like goddamn<br/>
Got these hoes like goddamn<br/>
All these ice that I'm rockin'<br/>
Got a nigga like goddamn<br/>
Like the city of goddamn<br/>
Fresh as hell like goddamn
