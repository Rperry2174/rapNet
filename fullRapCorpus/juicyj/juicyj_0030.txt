<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then light it<br/>
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher<br/>
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then light it<br/>
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher<br/>
(Get higher), get higher, (get higher), get higher, (get higher)<br/>
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher<br/>
(Get higher), get higher, (get higher), get higher, (get higher)<br/>
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Juicy J be throwed<br/>
Body movement slow<br/>
All a nigga do is sip lean and fuck hoes<br/>
Smoking with a queen<br/>
And she popped a bean<br/>
Call my niggas over, and let her fuck the team<br/>
And I'm taking drags<br/>
From the volcano bag<br/>
Pop off a couple of Mollies, reaching for the hash<br/>
I'm so fucked up, playing PS3<br/>
I'm bout to start a fire, Juicy J TNT<br/>
Mansion in Tennessee<br/>
Drinking on Hennessy<br/>
And my crib in Cali look like a dispensary<br/>
Toss that roach, where the lighter<br/>
Kief in the blunt, nigga get higher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Trippy as a fool, I got that double cup addiction<br/>
All these pills I'm popping, I'm in the water like I'm fishing<br/>
Two foreign bitches<br/>
And I got 'em kissing<br/>
Marijuana ménage à trois, nigga that's the mission<br/>
Sippin' on some sizzurp<br/>
Swisher full of pizzurp<br/>
Molly got the white girls going straight berserk<br/>
Styrofoam cup, nigga this ain't no Icee<br/>
I put hash on top of the weed like motherfucking icing<br/>
Can't no nigga do like me<br/>
This Bubble Kush, no licence<br/>
Copped a whole pound, this trippy life enticing<br/>
Your main bitch my groupie, I see why you don't like me<br/>
I put Molly on the tounge, of any nigga wifey<br/>
<br/>
