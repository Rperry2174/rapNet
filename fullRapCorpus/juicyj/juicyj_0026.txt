<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Lean overflowing like New Orleans' broken levies<br/>
No relationship with hoes, I just want that Becky<br/>
I'm bout my money, I gets my fetti<br/>
Street nigga, north Memphis, bitch I still rep it<br/>
Smokin' weed from the bong<br/>
And the lean got my sprung<br/>
Molly in my veins got my heart beatin' like a drum<br/>
Grinding on my teeth like a nigga chewing gum<br/>
Eye's Chinese tight, but I don't, work at Yung's<br/>
Juicy so high I feel like that I am on a cloud<br/>
Weed don't talk, but the shit I got here loud<br/>
After the show we grab the groupie hoes, I'm smokin' out<br/>
No smoke for free, no IOU's, no I don't do no vowels<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
The club doped out, we dove in<br/>
Shawty got that ass poked out, but I'm pokin'<br/>
I get that cap and gown, like I'm graduatin'<br/>
Shawty straight, on the bed, she ain't hesitatin'<br/>
I'm on that loud, you on that hush<br/>
Nigga I'm the shit, can't even flush<br/>
I'm gettin' money ballin', with out a contract<br/>
I ain't gotta smoke for you to catch a contact<br/>
I shoot guns, I don't blow guns<br/>
Smoke so much I should've had four lungs<br/>
I'm smokin', 'till my money gone<br/>
And that's no time soon, cause my money long<br/>
<br/>
