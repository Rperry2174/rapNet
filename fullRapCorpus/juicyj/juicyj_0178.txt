<i>[Intro: Lil Wayne sample]</i><br/>
Remix baaaby!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance<br/>
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bands<br/>
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance<br/>
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[French Montana]</i><br/>
(MONTANA!)<br/>
Bands a make her dance, 20's make her glance<br/>
50's make her flip, 100's make her give me head (head)<br/>
Cheeks clappin' (clappin'), she don't use no hands (hands)<br/>
All this pussy poppin' (poppin'), I'm just poppin' bands (bands)<br/>
I just pay the mortgage (mortgage), I just pay the note (note)<br/>
Hurricane Katrina (Katrina), bitch you need a boat (boat)<br/>
Bitch you need to float, show me what your twerkin' with<br/>
20 bottles, 30 models, 40 burners, bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lola Monroe]</i><br/>
She like what the fuck is a dollar bill, ass pound like impolo wheels<br/>
3 wheel motion, grip and grain, fuck the motion just get the change<br/>
I don't know what you thinking man, I take your money and get the brain<br/>
Them other bitches ain't build the same, he say you can't be real who built your frame<br/>
Ever seen a stripper got right, left, make it really wanna go pipe, that<br/>
But you ain't really gonna like, that, she fuck your brain, no mic, check<br/>
Money (money), bet you brake it off<br/>
You see that ass, you see that cash, bet she take it off like..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 1X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yeah, nigga...<br/>
Taylor Gang... Juicy, you a legend, nigga<br/>
Hahahahah...<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, I brought some bands so won't you dance, throw a stack on 2 hands<br/>
Another stack now that's 2 bands, bought a friend now that's 2 fans<br/>
Gettin' trippy now that's 2 Xans, double that now that's 4 bands<br/>
Juicy J he got more bands, trappin' hard like Snowman<br/>
Smokin' loud another grown man<br/>
Been gettin' money since a young nigga, but they respect me now couse I'm a grown man (ooh)<br/>
Condo by the ocean, forgot my watch now that's a Rolex<br/>
Hit the strip club, and spend more bread, and spill champenge on her for head (Yeah ho)<br/>
Smokin' and sippin, I'm talkin' that rich shit hoppin' that broke niggas listen<br/>
Shorty keep poppin' it strippin I got to reach in to my pockets keep tippin<br/>
Seen her with the team, that's my bands chick<br/>
Got rich off the internet so it's safe to say that's my band width<br/>
Tahahaha... Uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 1X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.o.B]</i><br/>
Uh, bands a make her dance, it'll make that ass go hammer,<br/>
It'll get her heels high for the sky, it'll make the 2 lips kiss the floor when she land (Damn)<br/>
That outta do it, if I'm with a bitch then she probetly hood<br/>
Gin on the rocks gone off the kush, gone off the bean,cshe in Mollywood<br/>
She dance for my bands like it's homecoming, she ain't working gettin' money, she at home cummin'<br/>
I state the facts, I brake her back if I drop a grip like it's snow money<br/>
I see broke niggas watching, cause they ain't got no paint<br/>
It's a lot of niggas saving hoes but Bobby Ray can't<br/>
I say whats going broke can y'all reminds us, lost in the money can't y'all finds us<br/>
Tosh and Nicole sliddin' on a pole, booty going dumb like Alzheimer<br/>
I say what's going broke please y'all remind us, self made niggas no co-sign us<br/>
Tosh and Nicole sliddin' down a pole, booty going dumb like Alzheimer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 1X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
Bank teller, bad bitches, paid niggas, they love me<br/>
Stripper hoes, married women, I be whether the bubby<br/>
Met a girl named Porsche, with a style ass like a horse<br/>
In V.I.P, at KOD, I'm gettin' oral intercourse<br/>
Twerking for bandz, I be on Xan, she gon' keep poppin' them racks on your hands<br/>
Juicy stay making it rain in the club, and I ain't leaving 'til that bitch flood<br/>
Rollin' like it's nothin', and I don't give a damn<br/>
I would say no to ratchet pussy but I just don't think I can<br/>
In the streets with a stripper sipping lean and tweakin', pop molly and that ass 'bout to get freaky<br/>
Gotta get some brain man and see what she thinkin', shawty don't spit, she like to keep it<br/>
White girls on that ox, and I'm on Bombay in that KK<br/>
Got major brain like Mitt Romney, fuck makin' it rain a tsunami<br/>
Bandz a make her dance <i>[echoes]</i>
