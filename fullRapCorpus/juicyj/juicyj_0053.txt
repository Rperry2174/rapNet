<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah... Still high<br/>
Still like fuck you niggas (Pussy!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I don't play with guns but we call them toys<br/>
Totin' big straps that make a lot of noise<br/>
Talking big money, niggas better know it<br/>
Gun never on safety, I'm paranoid<br/>
I don't pull it out unless I'm 'bout to shoot<br/>
I got military guns, I got goons too<br/>
Tryna' find me, where your black suit<br/>
You think you gon' catch me slippin', you a damn fool<br/>
My bitches strapped, they keep it in they purse<br/>
Tryna' ride up on me now you ridin' a hearse<br/>
That trippy shit, I'm on another planet (mars)<br/>
Niggas hating on me I'm bullet proof, a phantom<br/>
Ridin' in a black car, ridin' with a black bag<br/>
Black gloves, black hoodie, ridin' with a black mask<br/>
I know niggas scared, so don't try to flex<br/>
A couple of bullets hit his body tore up his chest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
A hundred rounds, I won't miss ya ass<br/>
Put your ass on a shirt saying they miss your ass<br/>
Your family miss you, your girl miss you<br/>
The niggas miss you, Juicy J I won't miss ya<br/>
I won't miss ya <i>[x3]</i> Juicy J I won't miss ya <i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Instrumental]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
