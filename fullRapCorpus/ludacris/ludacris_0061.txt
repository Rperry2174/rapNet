<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Warning! This album contains Ludacris material<br/>
Parental discretion is advised<br/>
So kids cover your ears and close your eyes<br/>
Otherwise you're about to witness HISTORY<br/>
The thoughts and views expressed on THIS album<br/>
are a direction reflection of the new generation<br/>
So without further ADIEUX<br/>
I bring to YOU, that nigga named Luda<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
HEY! I be that nigga named LUDA give a round of applause<br/>
They say I'm up to no good, I'll say I'm down for the cause<br/>
Down for whatever goes down, I'm strapped down to my drawers<br/>
So if you up for some stitches then I'm down for some scars<br/>
Down to make 'em GET DOWN, stop playing and pause<br/>
There's two things I'll never break and that's my word and my balls<br/>
So here's a temporary fix for your permanent flaws<br/>
This album helps you to RELEASE cause life is irking us all<br/>
Enough to make you wanna break shit, no longer will I take shit<br/>
From ANY of these clowns cause I'm TIRED of this fake shit<br/>
I'm ready for some action, ready with a passion<br/>
Like pots with the steam I'm ready to get it cracking<br/>
It's six years and counting if you think I'm a joke<br/>
Me getting served is like Bill Gates and Oprah going broke<br/>
It's 'bout time they gave it to me, I'm the reigning champ<br/>
Your favorite rapper went to Ludacris' training camp<br/>
Beotch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Yeah shawty! (That's right)<br/>
On the real I feel you on that<br/>
Man I'm tired of all these fake-ass niggaz homes<br/>
(Hell yeah shawty) Ay ay, this your boy Lil' Black<br/>
Representing that zone-trey you feel me<br/>
All these niggaz ay, I told y'all hoes that I'm the man<br/>
I told y'all homey nigga just need to get to the money man<br/>
Stop fucking with homes man, feel me?<br/>

<br/>
Man Joe, I'ma tell you what the bid'ness is<br/>

If you ain't fucking with my guy, What is yo' life about?<br/>
Kick rocks, SKEEZER please!<br/>
<br/>
Yo God, man Chris can kiss my ass<br/>
He remember me, I was at the club right there with him<br/>
He he coulda got me in<br/>
I mean I went to Benjamin Banneker high school with him<br/>
I knew him before all the fame<br/>
That's how you gonna do your people man?<br/>
That's how you gonna do your folk?<br/>
<br/>
Yup! Tch man I used to cook for this nigga<br/>
See he done come over to my house the other day<br/>

And my homegirl was over there and she was like<br/>
"Girl he look so tall on TV!"<br/>
I said, "Girl I told you he was short"<br/>
Maaaaaaan, I don't give a damn<br/>
I looooove that nigga!
