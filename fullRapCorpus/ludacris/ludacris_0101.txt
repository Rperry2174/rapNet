<i>[Monica]</i><br/>
I can't live with ya, can't live without you<br/>
I say I can't live with ya, can't live without you<br/>
Ooh I can't live with ya, can't live without you<br/>
I can't live with ya, can't live without you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
One day I love you, the next I can't stand you<br/>
Huh, it's too much for me to handle<br/>
I made my mind up thinkin I'm on the right track<br/>
So then I leave you, but then come right back<br/>
And I don't like that, I swear I'm so confused<br/>
Don't know what I want or what's the right thing to do<br/>
But the right thing is you, you're my destiny<br/>
Even at my worst you still bringin out the best in me<br/>
But then you testin me, know how to push my buttons<br/>
Fussin, fightin, yeah we always gettin into somethin<br/>
So mad I make you cry, then we make love<br/>
A never-endin cycle, make up to break up<br/>
It's time to wake up, I need to smell the coffee<br/>
Play with these other women, or get 'em all off me<br/>
And you wonder why your man'll just doubt ya<br/>
Can't live with ya, can't live without ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Monica]</i><br/>
I can't live with ya, can't live without you<br/>
I say I can't live with you, can't live without you<br/>
Ooh I can't live with ya, can't live without you<br/>
The one thing that I know, is I can't seem to let you (go)<br/>
You got me to the point of walking out the (door)<br/>
And then I find myself coming back for (more)<br/>
I don't know what to do<br/>
Cause I can't live with ya, and can't live without you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
One day I love you, the next I can't stand you<br/>
Huh, it's too much for me to handle<br/>
One minute naggin me, always harrassin me<br/>
Next minute squeezin me, huggin, kissin and grabbin me<br/>
Just when I think it's cool, you back startin shit<br/>
Findin the smallest things just to start an argument<br/>
Goin through my phone, KNOW you shouldn'ta took it though<br/>
I hope your stupid ass find what you're lookin fo'<br/>
Stormin out the house mad, throwin breakin shit<br/>
Callin your girls, exaggeratin and fakin shit<br/>
Pack your clothes like you really 'bout to leave this time<br/>
KNOW you messed up but actin like it's me this time<br/>
It's a revolvin door, that keeps spinnin 'round<br/>
Are we gon' be together, or are we finished now?<br/>
And you wonder why your man'll just DOUBT ya<br/>
Can't live with ya, can't live without ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Monica]</i><br/>
When the going get tough and the fightin be rough<br/>
Now some folks may call it hood but I guess we call it love<br/>
I be askin for your touch then I don't give you my trust<br/>
First I hate you with a passion then I can't need you enough<br/>
I be, wantin to spend my whole life wit'chu<br/>
And I be, talkin 'bout how you and me are through<br/>
And my mind says yes but my heart says no<br/>
And my mind says walk but my feet won't go away yeahhhh<br/>
See I be tellin you to go<br/>
but deep inside I want you to stayyyyy<br/>
Uh, and you know how to make me smile<br/>
but at times you ruin my dayyyyy<br/>
Ooh, we gotta get better<br/>
Gotta get it together<br/>
And you wonder why your girl just doubt ya<br/>
Can't live with you, can't live without youuuuu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
