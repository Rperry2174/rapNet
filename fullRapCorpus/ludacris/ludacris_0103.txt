<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I got 5 kisses where you want 'em at<br/>
Either one on your lips,<br/>
Your ear, your neck, your stomach, or your back.<br/>
Your inner thigh, right on your knee cap or your belly button. <br/>
These other guys be out here talkin but they steady frontin, <br/>
They don't know what they want that's why I tell you put your trust in me. <br/>
Share all your secrets, all your desires and your fantasies. <br/>
I aint gon tell nobody, baby I'm an only child.<br/>
I'd keep it to myself cuz all I wanna do is see you smile, <br/>
Knowin that you got someone to talk to aint that what yu want? <br/>
I'll be your lover, your provider, and your confiDONT. <br/>
And I won't judge you cuz I kno that aint nobody perfect,<br/>
But you got some perfect imperfections that makes you worth it. <br/>
I wanna see yo body in all the positions that you like it in, <br/>
We could do it slow or have some drinks, it gets in enticing when...<br/>
You like it rough I give it rough and I start to pull your hair,<br/>
Cuz ecstasy's your destination and ima take you there...<br/>
Tell me a secret baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Ne-Yo]</i><br/>
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows, <br/>
And think about it just as soon as the door closes. <br/>
Tell me a secret baby, <br/>
Tell tell tell me a secret baby. <br/>
Show me somethin that nobody else sees. <br/>
Tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,<br/>
Tell me a secret baby. <br/>
Tell tell tell me a secret baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
And there aint nobody in the universe that compete's with you, <br/>
Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do. <br/>
Blind folded,<br/>
Hancuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name, <br/>
Maybe you think im playin but this is really far from a mothafuckin game. <br/>
Aint a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be. <br/>
And I got just what you want baby girl you want it..<br/>
See it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off. <br/>
Jsut give me your body its garuanteed that ima<br/>
Break you off off off off off until the sun rise,<br/>
And im not here to disappoint just give me one try. <br/>
One kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,<br/>
But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret,<br/>
Ne-Yo holla at 'em.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Ne-Yo]</i><br/>
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows,<br/>
And think about it just as soon as the door closes. <br/>
Tell me a secret baby,<br/>
Tell tell tell me a secret baby. <br/>
Show me somethin that nobody else sees. <br/>
Tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,<br/>
Tell me a secret baby. <br/>
Tell tell tell me a secret baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
So we can talk about your fantasies, <br/>
And aint nobody gotta know but me, <br/>
Baby come on and make this move if you gonna,<br/>
Baby we grown we can do what we wanna, <br/>
Said you can tell me what you like to do, <br/>
Baby girl you never know I may like it to, <br/>
Baby come on and make this move if you gonna, <br/>
Baby we grown we can do what we wanna,<br/>
Ayeeeee.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Ne-Yo]</i><br/>
Tell me somethin that nobody else knows, <br/>
And think about it just as soon as the door closes. <br/>
Tell me a secret baby, <br/>
Tell tell tell me a secret baby. <br/>
Show me somethin that nobody else sees. <br/>
Tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,<br/>
Tell me a secret baby. <br/>
