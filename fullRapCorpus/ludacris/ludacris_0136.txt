Yeah<br/>
Anything you wanna do I'm ready to do it, my nigga, just say so<br/>
Don't say it on the record with your chest, leave the booth and then go lay low<br/>
Hiding behind your security detail, actin' like a female<br/>
I done sold over 20 million records I could really give a fuck about retail<br/>
Now back to basics<br/>
Back to Adidas with the fat laces<br/>
Back to the Ac' where I'm riding to the track in the track, get it straight nigga, no chases<br/>
Age ain't nothing but a number, Luda rapping like he just turned 24<br/>
Any rapper wanna forget who I am every now and then I see I gotta let em know<br/>
Yo must I remind you<br/>
You rap like something behind you<br/>
Got paid, but your heart pump Kool Aid<br/>
Cover Girl make up should have signed you<br/>
But it's never too late<br/>
15 years, nigga, never too great<br/>
4 years off getting Hollywood checks, but you niggas want beef and you looking like steak<br/>
<br/>
I see that liquor got you loose<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth<br/>
I'll make you niggas lose a tooth<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth<br/>
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm the truth<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth<br/>
Now I'm like, fuck calling a truce<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth<br/>
<br/>
Hol' up<br/>
Never fuck with a nigga who got some kids<br/>
Cause when you talk about me, then you talk about them<br/>
Then I gotta come where you live<br/>
You takin' food out they mouth, now I gotta put a fist in yours<br/>
I don't play about my hustle<br/>
A nigga got all these acres<br/>
All my neighbors think I'm flipping them birds<br/>
Naw, but I be flipping these words<br/>
Anything you hear me saying I could back up<br/>
And you talk so tough on the mic<br/>
But whenever you in sight, nigga, something don't add up<br/>
Put your money where your mouth is<br/>
Wait, put a gat where your blouse is<br/>
You think it's funny cus it's sunny where your house is<br/>
Bitch, I'll put my muddy ass boots where your couch is (Fuck yo couch)<br/>
I live this shit, you know you do this just for show, nigga<br/>
You act as if Ludacris just came and took your ho, nigga<br/>
You's a ho, nigga, yeah I said it twice<br/>
Let this be warning number two, motherfucker go and roll the dice<br/>
<br/>
I see that liquor got you loose<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth<br/>
I'll make you niggas lose a tooth<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth<br/>
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm the truth<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth<br/>
Now I'm like, fuck calling a truce<br/>
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
