<i>[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night<br/>
.. and the hood rolls on<br/>
How do I begin to, do this shit right<br/>
.. get my hustle on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Look here!<br/>
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word<br/>
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred<br/>
It's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst<br/>
Then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first<br/>
It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat<br/>
But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat<br/>
And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions<br/>
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions<br/>
I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war<br/>
Curiosity killed the cat, why am I Curious George?<br/>
Gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz<br/>
And just cause somethin looks don't really mean that it is<br/>
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife<br/>
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life<br/>
I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood<br/>
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways<br/>
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today<br/>
Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it<br/>
is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin<br/>
Dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down<br/>
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now<br/>
Can't tell me nothin still hungry as the day I began<br/>
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand<br/>
And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact<br/>
Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that<br/>
was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12<br/>
Tryin to get in where I fit, streets givin me hell<br/>
But yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that<br/>
Continue doin wrong 'til I was on the right - track<br/>
Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH<br/>
But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart<br/>
We all make mistakes, it's all good<br/>
<br/>
Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits<br/>
Livin life on the cuttin edge, takin a stab at it<br/>
And learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice<br/>
Just admittin when I'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right<br/>
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours<br/>
There's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars<br/>
But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds<br/>
Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb<br/>
Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by<br/>
That's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky<br/>
Never blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes<br/>
They wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close<br/>
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringin so much life to my shows<br/>
I've seen smiles I'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold<br/>
Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul<br/>
Just be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - to fade w/ ad libs]</i>
