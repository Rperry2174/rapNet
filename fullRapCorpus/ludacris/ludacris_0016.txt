<i>[Hook 3x]</i><br/>
GO TO SLEEP, hoe to sleep, GO TO SLEEP, hoe to sleep<br/>
IF YOU'RE TIRED BE QUIET AND GO TO SLEEP, hoe to sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Maaan, I tell a hoe to go to sleep (go to sleep)<br/>
They turn around and frown, gotta make 'em six feet deep<br/>
'Cause we knock 'em unconscious with that non-sense<br/>
Read in between that fine print, think about lyrical con-tent<br/>
Then about where your time spent<br/>
Mess around get your guys hit; a ten HUUUT!<br/>
I send Three-Six ol' sheeyit, nigga WHAT?<br/>
If ya tired ya tired, if ya snooze ya lose<br/>
But you you won't wrap up ya bandages, or heal you wound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Infamous 2-0]</i><br/>
Nigga I got shotty's and semi's - I love 'dro and Henne' ?<br/>
All brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many<br/>
I got QP's and halves - if we beefin' I blast<br/>
You sleepin' I laugh, ask 'Cris, I'm off the rip<br/>
I had this hoe who talked too much; I had to off the bitch<br/>
2-0, Mr. Crayola; niggas know what I mean<br/>
'Cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green<br/>
And all you faggot-motherfuckers gotta know the routine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Crunchy Black]</i><br/>
Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors<br/>
I look for div-idends - I ain't lookin' for you hoes<br/>
You bitch can't com-prehend; let me put one in your boot<br/>
Let me put one in your boat, so you ? can go to sleep<br/>
So, lay down bitch; gimme all that you dreamed for<br/>
Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boi<br/>
It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi<br/>
Them god damn toys; do you know what I mean, boi?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Paul]</i><br/>
Now if you warrin' and runnin' from them Three-Six niggas<br/>
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga<br/>
Or bustin' massive 'round some S.K.<br/>
My last trip to A-T-L I fucked yo' cascade<br/>
I'm strippin' bitches and I'm a ball fucker with a limp<br/>
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp<br/>
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout<br/>
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth<br/>
We Memphis niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
North, north, south, south, Westwood, Orange Mound<br/>
Nigga we be smokin' life; never shut ya Charlie Brown<br/>
Memphis niggas in this bitch; pockets full, ya know we bail<br/>
Hooked up with my nigga 'Cris, then we head to A-T-L<br/>
Players wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, "Fuck you hoe!"<br/>
Nigga rollin' optimos, as long that white shit up they nose<br/>
Mayn this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around<br/>
Juicy J be high as fuck; catch me in the lost and found<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Fate]</i><br/>
Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for<br/>
And up, get yourself in this clique<br/>
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut<br/>
Look, I'm from Gittero what?<br/>
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck<br/>
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up<br/>
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up<br/>
Ass in, ain't no askin'; it's no tolerance as long bitch check in<br/>
She wit' me, comments will only get you basically eternally resting<br/>
So abide by the call of the streets<br/>
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash<br/>
?Cause Lil Fate gonna creep in ya home while you gone<br/>
Have you comin' back findin' nutt on yo' sheets<br/>
<br/>
