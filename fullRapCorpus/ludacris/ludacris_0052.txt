<i>[Chorus 2X: Ludacris]</i><br/>
If you a lame motherfucker, get yo' ass out!<br/>
I'm from the A, I came to party 'til I pass out!<br/>
So if you with me and you tipsy throw your fist up!<br/>
If you got diamonds and they shinin throw your wrist up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Hey hey<br/>
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine<br/>
And I'm steady lookin for two women I can come in between<br/>
You can catch me chillin up in the cut but I'm always ready for ac-tion<br/>
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan and lay low, like {?} Jack-son<br/>
Ma-xin and rela-xin, haters, do they really wanna test me mannnn<br/>
I got an arsenal waitin, do they really wanna catch me mannnn<br/>
No, I, don't, think, so<br/>
I've, got killers on the pay-roll if there's a, problem then say-so<br/>
I, make dough until there's none left<br/>
I run with plenty gangs that's holdin thangs<br/>
and rearrange your frame in one breath<br/>
So to keep on breathin I suggest you take this beatin<br/>
'Tis the season for bleedin and we've been lookin for a reason<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Hey hey<br/>
Come holla at me, I'm a star, I got the hood on smash<br/>
You know me!  My whole car smell like a woodshop class<br/>
I point 'em out like her, her, that girl with the mouth<br/>
plus you and your friends<br/>
Let me show you some whips that don't come out 'til the year of 2010<br/>
So I'm flockin 'em in, 'til the droptop is rockin again<br/>
Boy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin<br/>
And I'm clockin these ends, my record sales are blockin 'em in<br/>
Gotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen<br/>
My entourage is game faces, mean muggin, mean muggin<br/>
Now the media is convinced that we thuggin, we thuggin<br/>
Momma told me grow up to be somethin, be somethin<br/>
I went diamond with this album so we buckin, we buckin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me mayne<br/>
When I'm pushin 90 by myself up in the H.O.V. lane<br/>
They tryin to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane<br/>
Bein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game<br/>
Now desperate artists tryin to sue but they just makin some claims<br/>
Can't get in the spotlight for NOTHIN and it just makes 'em insane<br/>
That's why some of the niggaz resort right back to bakin that 'caine<br/>
And sellin it off to junky monkeys who keep bakin they brain<br/>
As they grow older they'll be feelin a lot of achin and pain<br/>
So right at the head they might as well just be aimin that thang<br/>
And you ain't helpin the process out by always cakin these dames<br/>
But it is hard givin up the place where they be shakin they thangs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
