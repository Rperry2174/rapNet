<i>[Chorus 2X: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Stop movin so slow - I got mouths to feed<br/>
Hurry up and let's go - I got mouths to feed<br/>
Rain hail sleet snow - I got mouths to feed<br/>
So you already know I'm 'bout to GET TO THAT PAPER<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Listen, look I gotta feed my family by all means necessary<br/>
Cause paychecks are comin up shorter than February<br/>
Can't get a real job, I never finished school<br/>
Can't get no new clothes, I wore the same tennis shoes<br/>
But now the game's changed, I'm all about the hustle<br/>
And even Hogan Knows Best, I'm all about the muscle<br/>
I'm all about my team, I'm all about my green<br/>
I'm 'bout supply and demand, I'm 'bout to serve the fiends<br/>
And I'm a workin dream, I keep the circuit clean<br/>
See I'm the FUCKIN FUTURE~! I'm a workin machine<br/>
Don't trust a soul I'm the only one watchin my cream<br/>
So I stay in heavy rotation like a washing machine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Motherfucker I'm a monster in this game, I turn 20 into 50<br/>
50 to a hundred and a hundred to a Bentley<br/>
A Bentley to a building and a building to a 'scraper<br/>
Can't keep up with the news but I get that Daily Paper<br/>
And youse a daily hater cause my foot game is major<br/>
After a while, crocodile, see you later alligator<br/>
My baby need new shoes, her momma need Giuseppes<br/>
Mercedes need new shoes surrounded with Pirellis<br/>
A finger to the world, paid my dues and I'm ready<br/>
To pack up all the tools and just cruise in the Chevy<br/>
Million dollar deals makin moves on my celly<br/>
Cause I owe it to my girl to put food in her belly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Wake up and smell the coffee, it's time to make the doughnuts<br/>
A kid who had a kid, my kid made me a grown-up<br/>
You ever threaten mines I won't resist to put the chrome up<br/>
My guns'll be like gang signs (ALWAYS GETTIN THROWN UP)<br/>
Atlanta put your zone up, we true to these streets<br/>
I got 12 hungry artists, whole CREW gotta eat<br/>
So hell NO I don't sleep, I'm like an Energizer battery<br/>
Got 19 employees, I gotta pay they salary<br/>
My momma quit her job and I retired my pops<br/>
Got killers on the payroll, I hired some cops<br/>
I accept responsibility, they all pay rent<br/>
So if it don't make dollars then it don't make cents<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
