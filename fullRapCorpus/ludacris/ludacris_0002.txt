DTP nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Infamous 2-0]</i><br/>
I started with ten mack tens<br/>
And ten clips and ten pens<br/>
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years<br/>
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten<br/>
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fate Wilson]</i><br/>
At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs<br/>
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs<br/>
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves<br/>
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks<br/>
Watching eight flicks<br/>
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips<br/>
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles<br/>
DID I DO THAT or was it Mystikal and Urkel?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Infamous 2-0]</i><br/>
On to 7 Ak 47, so what?<br/>
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck<br/>
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week<br/>
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4<br/>
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door<br/>
These DTP niggas come ready for war<br/>
So don't start the fucking game<br/>
If you won't settle the score<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fate Wilson]</i><br/>
I got six hoes distributing on six blocks<br/>
It's blistering from cops tryna stop these rocks from distributing<br/>
Six gun shots left<br/>
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit<br/>
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus<br/>
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse<br/>
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars<br/>
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Infamous 2-0]</i><br/>
I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor<br/>
For you niggas talkin' shit<br/>
I'm fixin' to show you what for<br/>
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearst<br/>
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fate Wilson]</i><br/>
I fuck three best friends<br/>
Ran on all three the same game<br/>
In these streets I'm a murderer<br/>
I got three alias names<br/>
I'm three times insane<br/>
Three shots will cave your brain<br/>
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4<br/>
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door<br/>
These DTP niggas come ready for war<br/>
So don't start the fucking game<br/>
If you won't settle the score<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition<br/>
But at Friday the 13th<br/>
What's up now superstition?<br/>
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins<br/>
Double jeopardy<br/>
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fate Wilson]</i><br/>
I got one motto get dough till your gone<br/>
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes<br/>
I'm numero uno with one more before I go<br/>
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Infamous 2-0]</i><br/>
And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me<br/>
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys<br/>
0-6 is my clique along with PC<br/>
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1<br/>
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twain<br/>
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1<br/>
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twain<br/>
<br/>
It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4<br/>
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door<br/>
These DTP niggas come ready for war<br/>
So don't start the fucking game<br/>
If you won't settle the score
