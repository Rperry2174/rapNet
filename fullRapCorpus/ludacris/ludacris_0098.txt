<i>[Ludacris - Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[Ludacris - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Now I be riding in my Bentley coupe stuntin with the top down<br/>
four 24 inch rims so heavy they hold the block down<br/>
24 carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck<br/>
3 things you can’t take away from me, money, power and respect<br/>
I got it and hold on to it you knew that I never let it go<br/>
you prostitute it but money I never let it ho<br/>
speakin of hoe’s oh yes we meet em and we G’ em dude<br/>
and we may see em but we wouldn’t want to be em dude<br/>
I put my fist up, I got the power girl<br/>
I wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl<br/>
it’s been an hour girl, it’s time to go<br/>
and if my neighbour see you while you walking out my door (hey ho)<br/>
they be saying hey ho<br/>
they be saying hey ho<br/>
they be saying hey ho<br/>
they be saying hey ho<br/>
they be saying hey ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Kim]</i><br/>
Can’t nobody do it like Kim<br/>
only women that can do it like men<br/>
VVS is be them gems<br/>
(ho, now count that)<br/>
my money coming in<br/>
bringing them corners on them rims<br/>
so play the check book tell me how do you bounce that<br/>
I bounce into position like I am vinegar Kama Sutra<br/>
but money make me come, go and ask Luda<br/>
and women cheat better than men we don’t disturb them<br/>
my motto is "what they don’t know won’t hurt them"<br/>
we just do it like you do, see the roles done switched<br/>
if I’m a ho you’s a ho, if I’m a bitch you’s a bitch<br/>
know that I’ma stay rich so fella’s do what you do<br/>
cause you don’t fuck us niggas we fuck you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kim - Chorus]</i><br/>
(hey ho)<br/>
now we saying (hey ho)<br/>
now we saying (hey ho)<br/>
now we saying (hey ho)<br/>
now we saying (hey ho)<br/>
now we saying (hey ho)<br/>
<br/>
If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying...<br/>
<i>[Kim - Chorus]</i><br/>
If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Fate]</i><br/>
she likes the night lights, brights lights, big spending<br/>
Lil Fate been big pimpin, pimpin<br/>
so don’t be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny<br/>
cause you know that most you ladies trading sex for money<br/>
so if you coming out the pocket then you might get laid<br/>
thats how the rent car no the cell phone get paid<br/>
I bet the snakes all show once you cut that grass<br/>
and I’m a pimp so it’s time that I exploit they ass<br/>
you see it’s hoes after the party it’s hoes after the show<br/>
it’s hoes up in the lobby, it’s hoes out on the stroll<br/>
here’s some no dough, no dough no sleep<br/>
ho on your feet, if you don’t work you don’t eat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
