<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Look, I make my own decisions<br/>
Learn from my own mistakes<br/>
My enemies they want beef but don’t know whats at stake<br/>
I started out with nothing, just a dream and some hope<br/>
I fiend for the riches like them crackheads fiend for the dope<br/>
I went from freeze tag to holding some weed bags<br/>
To a clown of hoes juggling my bean bag<br/>
I went from spin the bottle to kiss the model<br/>
To 3 more seconds we gone find out if she spits or swallows<br/>
I heard its a recession, while you hardly survive<br/>
The hardest decision of my day is which car I’ma drive<br/>
Roll’s Royce Phantom, maybe the gold Ac’<br/>
Or the origami Ferrari the way it fold back<br/>
This ain't no 760, bitch this an Alpiner<br/>
Custom kicks chrome lips as deep as vagina<br/>
And women lost for words, guess they don’t know English<br/>
No matter what language they speak they all know dinglish<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Don’t you understand with this blunt in my hand<br/>
(I’m fire) smoke smoke smoke sumthin;<br/>
And don’t you understand with the World in my hand<br/>
If I ain't the shit<br/>
Don’t you understand with this blunt in my hand<br/>
(I’m fire) smoke smoke smoke sumthin;<br/>
And don’t you understand with the World in my hand<br/>
If I ain't the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now as the World turns spinning on its axis<br/>
My dick be brushing women’s lips like chapstick<br/>
They say it’s cold on the outside<br/>
So like a dentist I’m tryna keep the mouth wide<br/>
Reminiscing on my days on the southside<br/>
I made many leak and I ain't talkin’ ’bout no housewives<br/>
From eating canned tuna, to shoe hills with puma<br/>
From women saying “hey chris” to “GODDAMN LUDA!”<br/>
From playing slap box to making the ‘Lac drop<br/>
To white neighbours swear I’m selling crack rock<br/>
Eyes so low they think I’m Asian when I’m blazing<br/>
Cause that purples on my chest like I’m playing for the Ravens<br/>
Cadillac Devilles still rolling til the tires flat<br/>
Not from Arizona but I swear I want that diamond back<br/>
Sunroof tar, wood grain wheel<br/>
I sign for millions, ya’ll would never get the same deal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big K.R.I.T.]</i><br/>
I got a candy coated fetish, hoe don't you forget it<br/>
But big big big let me wet it, its that K-R-I-T stay besides me<br/>
We can go get this dough, then we mind if you show me dime<br/>
I promise you wont let go<br/>
I got an old school and that bass big<br/>
If it ain't on chrome than it ain't me<br/>
And my mouthpiece colder than the ice season<br/>
Call me father Winter in the peak of summer I spit December<br/>
Breaking backs as they cracking limber<br/>
If that's your bitch than she can’t remember<br/>
I give her wood, she holla timber<br/>
And the paint I play the sum or attention<br/>
Television of a player with an intention to be rich?<br/>
Well I hate to mention?<br/>
Back again, one more time for the buck niggas<br/>
And the thoroughbread that won’t fuck with ‘em<br/>
And hanged on cause I stuck with ‘em<br/>
I ain't got time to waste hoe<br/>
Didn’t have shit now I make more than I can barely count<br/>
Keep the thoroughbread shaking what the Good Lord gave ‘em<br/>
Yo chick ass been a bounce<br/>
We still live from the underground<br/>
Ain't nothing changed to me<br/>
I put it down from the south, and body everything these lames claim to be<br/>
Young Chris…<br/>
<br/>
