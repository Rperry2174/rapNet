Ey man, if you got a problem with somebody<br/>
Whatever happened to approaching them?<br/>
Looking at em eye to eye<br/>
Too much tweefin' going on in this world<br/>
Thumb thuggin' is at an all-time high<br/>
They startin' to take this shit a lil too far Jack<br/>
Rappers all in they feelings<br/>
Well here goes a little lyrical healing<br/>
<br/>
And hip hop is, uh<br/>
Too many rappers gettin' sensitive<br/>
Ya'll should start a pussy ass nigga initiative<br/>
Cuz even when I'm not mic'd up<br/>
I'll fuck your life up<br/>
Come to your show when ya crowdsurfin' and hold a knife up<br/>
I tell your momma you ain't shit<br/>
I hope you skydive and all land in an alligator pit<br/>
Your album ain't shit, you couldn't sell it at an auction<br/>
Your five minutes is up, like Antoine Dodson<br/>
Meanwhile that Mary Jane got me wiser<br/>
And Mr. Jack Daniels is my spiritual advisor<br/>
Now everybody said I'm strapped and I'm too scary<br/>
And keep a hand under the pillow like the tooth fairy<br/>
Your favorite rapper say I'm sick and they ain't no antidote<br/>
They kidnapping my flows they ain't even leave a ransom note<br/>
Your shit is faker than the knockoff man<br/>
I'll make you niggas quit rappin' start a hot dog stand
