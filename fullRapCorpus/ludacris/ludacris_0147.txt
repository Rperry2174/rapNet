<i>[Intro - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Over a decade later<br/>
Let's toast to the good life<br/>
We still living the hood life<br/>
Welcome to my world Ludaversal!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Listen<br/>
I think I got the best job in the world<br/>
Cuz I ain't gotta take the piss test<br/>
Michael sending me Jordans every 1st of the month<br/>
Said his kids love me, ain't paid for a pair of kicks since<br/>
Why is it that when 'em niggas gettin' rich<br/>
The whole world just wanna get you some free shit? (Hahah)<br/>
Ain't that 'bout a bitch<br/>
Especially when they told me I'll never do shit, or be shit<br/>
I made it and never took you for granted<br/>
Took off and I never landed, supply whatever demanded and no one's ever handed it to me<br/>
I kicked it off with me and my special team and shot the <i>[?]</i> to me<br/>
Touchdown on my old turf, money and bitches sucking me in my microphone vest<br/>
And know I'm not surprised that my old <i>[?]</i> taking niggas to school, go do your homework<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Yeah, and I been going around in circles<br/>
Like everyday is a rehearsal<br/>
Is my life your entertainment?<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
My life your entertainment<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Almost everyday I'm waking up in another city<br/>
Another country, a different climate and a time zone<br/>
Jet lag but I'm out of the bed fast for bad foreign bitches that I'm eager to lay my eyes on<br/>
So I opened up the blinds to the sky on<br/>
Wish that I could talk to God on my iPhone<br/>
I thank Him for all of his generosity<br/>
And for satisfying most of my curiosity<br/>
Fans asking me what it's like to be me<br/>
I always tell 'em it's more good than bad<br/>
They say I want what you got<br/>
I tell 'em you'll never have shit if you don't appreciate what you have<br/>
So I have learned to appreciate all the simple things<br/>
Like some good head and a fine wine<br/>
We all going through life searching for answers<br/>
And I been all around the world trynna find mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Yeah, and I been going around in circles<br/>
Like everyday is a rehearsal<br/>
Is my life your entertainment?<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
My life your entertainment<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Seems like everyday is a holiday<br/>
Celebratory popping bottles and model days<br/>
Stereotypical rap shit personified<br/>
From 8 albums committin' lyrical homicide<br/>
These airports like international mazes<br/>
Now my passport needs additional pages<br/>
Then I'm staring out at another horizon<br/>
Staying fly even in the no fly zone<br/>
Bodies on board but my mind's gone<br/>
Ain't no better feeling than when I fly home<br/>
Staring out the window of the plane in the rains even the clouds need a shoulder to cry on<br/>
I'm crying cuz I'm living out my dreams<br/>
But this life is not easy as it seems<br/>
It's sorta similar to a crack game<br/>
Ain't no slowing down when you living in the fast lane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Yeah, and I been going around in circles<br/>
Like everyday is a rehearsal<br/>
Is my life your entertainment?<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal<br/>
My life your entertainment<br/>
This has been my world, Ludaversal!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken Outro:]</i><br/>
Life is a gift<br/>
And we have a responsibility to live it<br/>
From the first breath to the last<br/>
Our future is built on the foundation of our past<br/>
Experience is a professor, and its test's at a highest pressure<br/>
While we can't afford to crack<br/>
We must bear not to break<br/>
Like a reed in the wind we go with the flow<br/>
While still reaching for the light<br/>
Avoid useless conflict while never running from the fight<br/>
The struggle that forever brought me to just beneath the surface<br/>
I'm dedicating to the service of self and to my people<br/>
And to never feeding the beast of unnecessary evil<br/>
We say the motion of <i>[?]</i><br/>
Take the action to display our character<br/>
From the first second that we start to feast until the day that we break this barrier<br/>
So disparaging is a civilized savage only strive to become average<br/>
I'm not happier as a maverick<br/>
A cowboy that uses his cabbage to get more green than most millions done seen<br/>
The good kind and never the bad bitch<br/>
The best that life has to give are the blessings of this life that we live<br/>
And everyday I'm <i>[?]</i> not lose my way I've had to learn<br/>
Just remember in any existence it's not the destination but the journey<br/>
Live your life<br/>
<br/>
Just Blaze!
