Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me<br/>
Now I really could give a fuck<br/>
Not when I own over $15 million in real estate<br/>
And bought all the Fast &amp; Furious trucks, haha<br/>
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows<br/>
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows<br/>
See the Bridges Family values on the southside<br/>
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta house, why?<br/>
I'm not married, I've never been engaged<br/>
But yo dumb-ass believes whatever's on the front page<br/>
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies<br/>
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at'cha own lives<br/>
Cause technology exceeds all humanity<br/>
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity<br/>
Now private pics on my private no longer private, mane<br/>
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - John Legend:]</i><br/>
Ohh-whoa, livin' in the spotlight<br/>
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight, I think I'm gonna take flight<br/>
But I'ma be alright (alright) I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)<br/>
Let me liiive, 'til I die - ohh I<br/>
<br/>
I'm doin' interviews, gettin' asked the same questions from 10 years ago<br/>
Wonderin' to myself what the fuck I'm there for<br/>
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10<br/>
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport<br/>
That repetition will drive any human being nutty<br/>
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch<br/>
Thinkin' I got that "do what the fuck I wanna do" money<br/>
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house<br/>
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do<br/>
Soon as you get some money, it's gon' be someone with more than you<br/>
Sci-fi movies, the fans said "This album's overdue<br/>
And if you don't put some music out, these niggas gon' be over you"<br/>
Talkin' 'bout "Where that old Luda for the rapper's sake?"<br/>
But Ursher told me if I don't evolve, I'll evaporate<br/>
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen<br/>
If you're smart and went to college better use your intuition<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them<br/>
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em<br/>
They said I'm so visual, they overlook the lyrics<br/>
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it<br/>
Then steer it in the direction of your memory<br/>
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries<br/>
Wrote a song for my girl, she couldn't stand straight<br/>
My man said, "Don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base"<br/>
I said, "Man, my female fan base gon' be here for forever"<br/>
Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together<br/>
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em?<br/>
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers<br/>
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth<br/>
And I ain't scared of shit except God in a life jail suit<br/>
Especially when all of my bills are paid for<br/>
And God answered everything that I prayed for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend ad-libs to the end]</i>
