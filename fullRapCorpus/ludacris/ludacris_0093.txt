<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My chick bad<br/>
My chick hood<br/>
My chick do stuff dat ya chick wish she could<br/>
<i>[repeated]</i><br/>
My chick bad, badder than yours<br/>
My my chick bad, badder than yours<br/>
My my my chick bad, badder than yours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 1]</i><br/>
I’m saying my chick bad<br/>
My chick hood<br/>
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could<br/>
My chick bad, badder than yours<br/>
My chick do stuff that I can’t even put in words<br/>
Her swagger don’t stop<br/>
Her body won’t quit<br/>
So fool pipe down you ain’t talkin bout shit<br/>
My chick bad, tell me if you seen her<br/>
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena<br/>
All white top, all white belt<br/>
And all white jeans, body looking like milk<br/>
No time for games, she’s full grown<br/>
My chick bad, tell your chick to go home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now your girl might be sick but my girl sicker<br/>
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor<br/>
She knock a bitch out and fight<br/>
Coming out swinging like Tiger Woods wife<br/>
Yeah she could get a little hasty<br/>
Chicks better cover up there chests like pasty’s<br/>
Couple girl friends and they all a little crazy<br/>
Coming down the street like a parade Macy’s<br/>
I fill her up balloons<br/>
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons<br/>
Doh, but I aint talkin bout homer<br/>
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my bestie<br/>
But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi<br/>
Trash talk to em then I put em in a hefty<br/>
Running down the court I'm dunkin on em Lisa Leslie.<br/>
It’s going down, basement, friday the 13th guess who’s playing Jason<br/>
Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy<br/>
It’s nightmare on Elm street and guess who’s playing Freddy<br/>
(My chick bad)<br/>
Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy<br/>
The mental Asylum looking for me<br/>
You a rookie to me<br/>
I’m in dat wam bam purple Lam’ damn bitch you been a fan.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
