<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I been drinkin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I<br/>
Ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
Right<br/>
I been smokin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
Right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't<br/>
Feel right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Conjure straight up on the rocks I don't chase shit<br/>
Real nigga man, your crew be on that fake shit<br/>
When it come to getting slizzered, man I hold the belt<br/>
Swimming pool full of liquor, bitch I'm Michael Phelps<br/>
Drowning all you non-drinkers, non-smokers,<br/>
Non-dippers, non-poppers<br/>
Babysitter drinking thinking that you might have to go see a doctor<br/>
Stop the bullshittin', I let these punks know<br/>
If you ain't turnt, what the fuck you in the club for?<br/>
These niggas must be bout that life, bitch you damn right<br/>
Get out my section, off my couch and out my damn sight<br/>
Ever since I left the crib, I hit the ground running<br/>
Tell the waitress keep<br/>
Them motherfucking bottles coming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I been drinkin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
Right<br/>
If I<br/>
Ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't<br/>
Feel<br/>
Right<br/>
I been smokin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
<br/>
Right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I<br/>
Don't<br/>
Feel right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
The be like Luda looking rough, but his rhymes smooth<br/>
I'm in the studio, I gotta get my mind skewed<br/>
Give me that cup, give me that<br/>
Blunt, give me that sticky green<br/>
Give me that light, give me that sprite, and that promethazine<br/>
Sippin' slow, no ho, I'm not in no rush bitch<br/>
Don't tell my doctor, let's just keep this on the hush bitch<br/>
I'm on another level, these niggas on the floor<br/>
They be like who's Luda's suplier, bitch you'll never know<br/>
Top notch, top tier, I'm a top nigga<br/>
Slap her bottom while your girlfriend give me top nigga<br/>
Told her listen, you should gargle more, and speak less<br/>
We took some shots<br/>
And turned that shit into a drink fest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I been drinkin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I<br/>
Ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
Right<br/>
I been smokin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
Right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't<br/>
Feel right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I can't think straight<br/>
Take a smoke break<br/>
Get the blood<br/>
Goin', goin'<br/>
Light it up and<br/>
Smoke somethin'<br/>
Smoke somethin'<br/>
Smoke<br/>
Somethin'<br/>
Smoke somethin'<br/>
<br/>
I can't think straight<br/>
Take a drink<br/>
Break<br/>
Get the cup goin', goin'<br/>
Fill it up<br/>
Drink somethin'<br/>
Drink<br/>
Somethin'<br/>
Drink somethin'<br/>
Drink somethin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I been drinkin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I<br/>
Ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
Right<br/>
I been smokin' all night<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel<br/>
Right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't feel right<br/>
If I ain't fucked up I don't<br/>
Feel right
