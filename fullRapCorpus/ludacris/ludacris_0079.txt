<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris]</i><br/>
I just touched down in killa Cali, <br/>
Strapped up my boots, <br/>
Got scooped up by Game, <br/>
So I hopped up in the coupe, <br/>
Gaah, What up nigga <br/>
What the hell is goin on, <br/>
I'm tryin to ease back, <br/>
And get my head in the zone, <br/>
Where the fuck you tryin to go, <br/>
Nigga this yo city, <br/>
Anywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties, <br/>
So full mash the gas, <br/>
The night is young, <br/>
All bull shit aside, <br/>
I'm tryin to have some fun, <br/>
Hit the hop in Lakewood, <br/>
Or ride down Slawson, <br/>
Or to Casino, <br/>
they say it's just like Compton, <br/>
Really doesn't matter, <br/>
Long as shots don't ring out, <br/>
Nigga I stay strapped, <br/>
I don't wanna pull the thing out, <br/>
Well keep the heat heat, <br/>
right up under the seat, <br/>
and let's roll to Roscoe's, <br/>
And grab somethin to eat, <br/>
But check ya rear view mirror, <br/>
I swear somebody's following, <br/>
Rollin in that dark blue, <br/>
SS Impala and, <br/>
All up on tha bumpa, <br/>
Man I'm just sayin, <br/>
Tell me you know this nigga, <br/>
Naw they betta stop playin, <br/>
He sped up around, <br/>
And drove right in front of us, <br/>
Could be one time, <br/>
Just tryin to bust one of us, <br/>
Till he smashed the brakes, <br/>
And we almost hit him, <br/>
Throwin signs out the window, <br/>
like something was wrong with him, <br/>
Before we jump out, <br/>
And get ready to clown, <br/>
Nigga call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Keep one eye open, <br/>
Cause the streets don't sleep, <br/>
If the streets get hungry, <br/>
Then the streets gon eat, <br/>
That's why I keep some heat, <br/>
And a couple of rounds, <br/>
Nigga call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down, <br/>
Call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down, <br/>
Yeah, call up the homies, <br/>
It about to go down, <br/>
Yeah, that's why I keep some heat, <br/>
And a couple of rounds, <br/>
Nigga call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - The Game]</i><br/>
Somebody tell Luda, <br/>
I'm on the way now, <br/>
Aight, just stepped one size 12, <br/>
Air force one in the A-town, <br/>
And you know where I'm headed, <br/>
To the Lennox Mall, <br/>
To get it done head to toe, <br/>
N.W.A. style, <br/>
Do it then, Keep it gangsta, <br/>
From the waist down, <br/>
And this chrome tre pound, <br/>
Got me feelin, <br/>
Atlanta brave now, <br/>
Right, disturbin the peace, <br/>
I'll let the lead spray, <br/>
I'm startin to love this place, <br/>
They even got red clay, <br/>
Okay, hit a different, <br/>
Strip club everyday, <br/>
And I don't make it rain, <br/>
It's a hurricane on the way, <br/>
And I got, <br/>
The A-town pump, <br/>
It'll make ya whole body, <br/>
Do the A-town stomp, <br/>
Then it's off, <br/>
To the waffle house, <br/>
And pancake mix, <br/>
Ain't the only thing, <br/>
coming out of mouth, <br/>
And the 42 D's, <br/>
Coming out her blouse, <br/>
So baby, daddy coming in, <br/>
Game get out the house <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Keep one eye open, <br/>
Cause the streets don't sleep, <br/>
If the streets get hungry, <br/>
Then the streets gon eat, <br/>
That's why I keep some heat, <br/>
And a couple of rounds, <br/>
Nigga call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down, <br/>
Call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down, <br/>
Yeah, call up the homies, <br/>
It about to go down, <br/>
Yeah, that's why I keep some heat, <br/>
And a couple of rounds, <br/>
Nigga call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Ludacris &amp; Willy Northpole]</i><br/>
Yeah I'm in a real life movie, <br/>
So this is take 3, <br/>
Where Luda step foot, <br/>
Out in Phoenix, AZ, <br/>
Super Bowl, super hoes, <br/>
Drivers on stroll, <br/>
So I put the call in, <br/>
To Willie Northpole, <br/>
Big homie I got ya, <br/>
Stick to ya like a cactus, <br/>
Welcome to tha bird city, <br/>
Cris take off ya jacket, <br/>
I know you kind of used to, <br/>
Big bootys in the club, <br/>
But ain't nothing wrong, <br/>
To have a little salsa in ya blood, <br/>
I see a couple thugs, <br/>
With some bitch Tennessees, <br/>
My town but, <br/>
I still got Phoenix enemies, <br/>
Haters wanna stop em, <br/>
And I really wanna pop em, <br/>
But it's hard to fight back, <br/>
When you got an album droppin, <br/>
Connect, We in south Phoenix, <br/>
Nigga Africa bang, <br/>
Matter fact Cris, <br/>
Tuck in ya Africa chain, <br/>
Cause I see some nigga staring at us, <br/>
With a lame frown, <br/>
I'm a call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Keep one eye open, <br/>
Cause the streets don't sleep, <br/>
If the streets get hungry, <br/>
Then the streets gon eat, <br/>
That's why I keep some heat, <br/>
And a couple of rounds, <br/>
Nigga call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down, <br/>
Call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down, <br/>
Yeah, call up the homies, <br/>
It about to go down, <br/>
Yeah, that's why I keep some heat, <br/>
And a couple of rounds, <br/>
Nigga call up the homies, <br/>
It's about to go down
