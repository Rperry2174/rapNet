<i>[Quik]</i> Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Ay man let me ask you somethin man<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> You ever have one of them days where you felt like<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Paid off a car note or somethin<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Just jumped out the shower feelin fresh than a muh'fucka<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Witcha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?<br/>
<i>[Quik]</i> You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it<br/>
<i>[Quik]</i> In Compton we call that "spur of the moment"<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way<br/>
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day<br/>
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8<br/>
fo' a date with some other bust downs<br/>
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top<br/>
I take the breeze, quick break the trees<br/>
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't<br/>
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Quik]</i><br/>
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage<br/>
When we pair 'em, we gon' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch<br/>
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chillin with Luda-<br/>
-cris stop and twist the buddha got me feelin like this is it<br/>
If we gon' party, we gon' sip, we got a bar<br/>
We all in shape, we gon' go far, you can't stop the car<br/>
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt<br/>
You woulda thought you woulda learned me when my hair was all permed<br/>
I think y'all bullshittin with it dawg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight<br/>
<i>[KJ]</i> Therefore, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright<br/>
G'd up, my mind is freed up<br/>
<i>[KJ]</i> From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Quik]</i><br/>
Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice<br/>
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose<br/>
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels<br/>
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes<br/>
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour<br/>
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power<br/>
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss<br/>
What does bein mental cost?  If you ain't knowin you already lost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy<br/>
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey<br/>
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin<br/>
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin<br/>
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now<br/>
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up<br/>
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around<br/>
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive riiiiight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world<br/>
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl<br/>
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her<br/>
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper<br/>
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back<br/>
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack<br/>
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel<br/>
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Quik]</i><br/>
If it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz<br/>
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit<br/>
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped<br/>
Cause I do {?} elevation<br/>
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo<br/>
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows<br/>
And call it "More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6"<br/>
And show it in the back of my truck, at the picnic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i>
