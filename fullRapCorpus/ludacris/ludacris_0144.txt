<i>[Intro - Kanye West + Ludacris:]</i><br/>
(Applause)<br/>
And the winner, for the best rap album goes to<br/>
Ludacris it's your year baby<br/>
(Applause)<br/>
<br/>
This goes out to my father, who is in critical condition right now<br/>
I appreciate your prayers<br/>
Mr. Wayne Bridges<br/>
I love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris Talking:]</i><br/>
Rest in peace Wayne Bridges<br/>
You're still living through me<br/>
Listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Look, I lost my father to the bottle<br/>
I'd hug him everyday like I might not see him tomorrow<br/>
Got a enough sorrow for a lifetime<br/>
Cause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen<br/>
When he was seldom in his right mind<br/>
My early years I was too young to understand<br/>
But I remember the smell of beer and seeing all the empty cans<br/>
Waking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments<br/>
Hands off my momma, somehow I knew he was the cause of it<br/>
Got a little older and he got a little worse<br/>
Drinking must be his remedy, he got a little cursed<br/>
Well, tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops<br/>
The beat goes on, but the drinking's gotta stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Monica:]</i><br/>
If I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow<br/>
I would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey<br/>
But now you got me drunk out that pain, gone after sorrow<br/>
Wishing every day you were here with me<br/>
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle<br/>
Ooh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I lost my father to the bottle<br/>
Functioning alcoholics what they call it far as I know<br/>
Became a teenager and started to understand<br/>
But even through drinks he still taught me to be a man<br/>
So before the hospital, where the paramedics rushed him<br/>
Any and everybody who met him, instantly loved him<br/>
I run the con concerts? Would have made him even sicker<br/>
Cause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor<br/>
And tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?<br/>
He had the biggest heart, but also had that liver damage<br/>
Tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops<br/>
The beat goes on, but the drinking' gotta stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Monica:]</i><br/>
Not a day goes by that I don't miss ya, and don't wish you were here with me<br/>
No matter what you did, I forgive you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
I lost my father to the bottle<br/>
Tell your parents you love 'em<br/>
You might not see them tomorrow<br/>
I swallow my pride, try to put my problems aside<br/>
But I feel so hollow inside<br/>
Gotta keep my eyes on the prize<br/>
Cause I'm steady wishing you were here<br/>
To see the goals that I plan to reach<br/>
You left the day after I put you into my Grammy speech<br/>
It's almost like you waited just to see me win<br/>
Well, pops I can't wait until the day we meet again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Monica:]</i><br/>
I can't get over you you you, hey<br/>
Love in a bottle, hey heyyy<br/>
Oh, I miss you!<br/>
I wanna see you tomorrow<br/>
I wanna see you again<br/>
I wanna see you tomorrow<br/>
I miss you, you you you you<br/>
I love you, you you you
