<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
AOWWWW!<br/>
I never used to snore in my sleep 'til this rap shit started<br/>
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted<br/>
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it<br/>
And y'all think I'm gon' stop?  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast<br/>
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past<br/>
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass<br/>
And y'all prayin that I flop?  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green<br/>
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean<br/>
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens<br/>
Try 80, want a discount?  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
See in just six months I infiltrated the system<br/>
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him<br/>
Niggaz hate givin me props cause I might use it against them<br/>
C'mon, get Ludacris out!  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Ludacris]</i><br/>
If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone<br/>
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home<br/>
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong<br/>
But after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
It's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger<br/>
I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers<br/>
I'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer<br/>
If you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law<br/>
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall<br/>
Next year I'm lookin in to buyin Greenbriar Mall<br/>
You probably own a lot of property!  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls<br/>
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls<br/>
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws<br/>
I'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'ma throw you a curve<br/>
You mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words<br/>
I'ma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves<br/>
Pepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
My black people show me love when I'm up on the block<br/>
And Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop<br/>
White people love the flow, they say, "Dude, you fuckin rock!"<br/>
Yo' fans are my fans, right?  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
So find my album in the stores and look for the white steam<br/>
Rip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream<br/>
It's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream<br/>
Yo' scans are my scans, right?  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
Now Luda's throwin up A's, and I'm lightin up L's<br/>
Around the globe gettin paid, you home bitin yo' nails<br/>
DTP, the only label that practice fightin ourselves<br/>
We probably gettin on your nerves, huh?  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
I been eatin and gettin FAT while y'all dyin of hunger<br/>
I get drunk in the winter, stay high in the summer<br/>
Watch out, my album's puttin up McDonald's numbers<br/>
You over 6 million served, huh?  BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!<br/>
WHOO!
