<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, hah..<br/>
When it all come down to it we ain't have shit!<br/>
(Woo!  Use your mouth, haha)<br/>
Ludacris, 4-Ize, it's like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
I make niggaz eat dirt and fart dust<br/>
Then give you a eighty dollar gift certificate to Pussies 'R Us<br/>
I eat the whole pie, and leave nuthin but the crust<br/>
So you can feel what it's like, with instinct but no guts<br/>
A sac wit no nuts or a mack wit no sluts<br/>
Give me a full-body massage, I still can't be touched<br/>
They call me Seymour Butts, cause I get mo' ass than most<br/>
They say I'm next and got that butter love, and get too close<br/>
Follow the leader cause I'm meaner than medula oblongota<br/>
My +Tribe's+ on more +Quests+ than +Midnight Marauders+<br/>
It's all pi√±a coladas, no cops and robbers<br/>
Takin trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas<br/>
I hump more than llamas, get rolled more than tires<br/>
If you say I'm not nice, then youse a motherfuckin liar<br/>
Entitled to your Opini-ons, into the next millenium<br/>
So many +Major Coinz+ that I thought I had +Amil+lion<br/>
<br/>
4-Ize.. 4-Ize whatcha?  4-Ize<br/>
<br/>
<i>[4-Ize]</i><br/>
Yo, I am goin to blow up the Earth<br/>
with my "pew-36 explosive space modulator"<br/>
Buddha be praised, you meditator<br/>
Drop squad interrogator, 85 percent regulator<br/>
The Educator and the Almighty Creator, dedicater<br/>
The seperater of fiction, I spark friction<br/>
Smoking "Hay" without the +Crucial Conflict+ion<br/>
4-Ize prescription; microphone, Jackie Stallone<br/>
Psychic prediction, Egytian descripition<br/>
of my psychical, my flesh is weak and it's pitiful<br/>
Spiritiual is hooked up to the invisibile<br/>
umbilical cord of my Lord, Kumbiya Devine Kah<br/>
Remove paper of tar from every cigar<br/>
I slap authority like Gabor, Zsa Zsa<br/>
Half Allah, Half Anti Christ Superstar<br/>
Rockin the microphone with a hand like Dr. Claw<br/>
While I'm hittin trees - harder than Sonny Bono<br/>
Double Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo<br/>
I kill villians in slow-mo for talkin crazy in my Dojo<br/>
Got nothin to lose, like I'm a boxcar hobo<br/>
When I get Ludacris with bridges on the promo<br/>
Niggaz wanna clown; I'm +Homey+ and +Bozo+<br/>
Cause in the grand prize game my life callin like Jo-Jo<br/>
The name sticks like Toto<br/>
I keep it realer than alien autopsy photo<br/>
You similiar to a Spice Girl goin solo<br/>
You lost like BEBE, or a dog named Toto<br/>
My statue of liberty is Rebecca Lobo<br/>
We +Cop+ +Robo+, virgo<br/>
Bust ass like a motherfuckin homo, como estas?<br/>
Tony Del Negro<br/>
Built to destroy these kid's blocks of Legos<br/>
Lego my Eggo cause I say so<br/>
Hold the microphone, 4-Ize, I stay gifted<br/>
Manifested, elevated, I uplifted<br/>
The elevator, the esclator<br/>
"That's not a knife?  That's a knife!"<br/>
Crocodile Dundee the Alligator Rustler<br/>
Cause I hustle ya, under the +China+<br/>
+Big Trouble+, little sewer but still I find ya<br/>
Cause I'm stinky<br/>
Manifest, throw you down the stairs like a slinky<br/>
Yo, my third eye is blinky<br/>
<br/>
