<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Give it to me now, give it to me now<br/>
Give it to me now, give it to me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawna]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Give it to me now, give it to me now<br/>
Give it to me now..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ludacris, then Shawna *2X*]</i><br/>
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from yo' head to yo' toes<br/>
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'<br/>
Then I wanna, ahh ahh - you make it so good I don't wanna leave<br/>
But I gotta, kn-kn-kn-know what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line<br/>
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree<br/>
And if you like in the club we can do it<br/>
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.<br/>
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top<br/>
Lick it don't stop, keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock <br/>
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait til the show stop<br/>
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand<br/>
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man<br/>
Table top or just give me a lap dance<br/>
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands<br/>
That man Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom<br/>
Or in back of a classroom<br/>
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon<br/>
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em<br/>
I flash 'em and out last 'em<br/>
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em<br/>
I'll let 'em free <br/>
And the tell me what they fantasy<br/>
Like up on the roof roof tell yo boyfriend not to be mad at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I wanna get you in the bath tub<br/>
With the candle lit you give it up till they go out<br/>
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert<br/>
Cause you know I got sold out<br/>
Or red carpet dick could just roll out<br/>
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out<br/>
We can do it in the pouring rain<br/>
Runnin the train when it's hot or cold out<br/>
How 'bout in the library on top of books<br/>
But you can't be too loud<br/>
You wanna make a brother beg for it<br/>
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud<br/>
We can do it in the white house<br/>
Tryna make them turn the lights out <br/>
Champaign with my campaign let me do the damn thing<br/>
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name a sauna, jacuzzi<br/>
In the back row at the movie<br/>
You can stratch my back and rule me<br/>
You can push me or just pull me<br/>
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh<br/>
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I wanna get you in the back seat windows up<br/>
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert<br/>
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, ruff sex make it hurt<br/>
In the garden all in the dirt<br/>
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk<br/>
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid<br/>
In the sun or up in the shade<br/>
On the top of my escalade<br/>
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade; tag team, off the ropes!<br/>
On the ocean or in the boat! Factories or on hundred spokes!<br/>
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt<br/>
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt<br/>
Scream help play my game; dracula man I'll get my fangs<br/>
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my grades<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 4X]</i>
