Sing along with me,<br/>
<br/>
Say fuck you Luda <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea, I guess that's why everybody hates Chris<br/>
<br/>
Say fuck you Luda <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea, I guess that's why everybody hates Chris<br/>
<br/>
Ok now, this is for the Gs and this is for the hustlers<br/>
This is for the diamonds and the watch all clustered<br/>
Spread em like mustard, canary yellow<br/>
Now women in my face like hello<br/>
Yea I'm sort of a big deal<br/>
These Giovanni rims are sort of a big wheel<br/>
This five course dinner is sort of a big meal<br/>
This Bentley GT can make Luda dissapear<br/>
Faster than David Copperfield mothafucka<br/>
<br/>
I'm talkin five star tellis, and penthouse suites<br/>
Yea I'm just a playboy between penthouse sheets<br/>
Hit the club and go and party with some penthouse freaks<br/>
Party with Britney, Lindsay and Paris together<br/>
<br/>
Get in line and buyin' bottles that's taller than Chris Webber<br/>
And makin haters sneeze from diamonds and sick leathers<br/>
Cause my ice gives em cold like they as if they under the weather<br/>
But my women keep me warmer than a polo sweater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now I stay fresh to death draped in gangsta fits<br/>
Over 12 million sold I drop gangsta hits<br/>
Live in mansions and drive around in gangsta whips<br/>
You swear I'm bout to get into some gangsta shit<br/>
<br/>
Oh no here comes trouble, my vision is skewed<br/>
I can only see in doubles, two models two bottles<br/>
That'll pop like bubbles and when I get home<br/>
The girls tops lift off like airspace shuttles<br/>
<br/>
60 seconds till blast off<br/>
My car got a face lift and took it's mask off<br/>
Tint so dark it look like I took the glass off<br/>
The body was white for 8 weeks<br/>
Before I finally decided to take it's cast off<br/>
Now it's blacker than a bottom less pit<br/>
You talk shit you'll end up with bottom less lip<br/>
I hit a nigga so hard, I'll make him swallow his spit<br/>
Then I be with Bobby V on that anonymous shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I go for broke like TLC<br/>
The hottest nigga on the mic<br/>
Yea I believe that's me<br/>
Now all the ladies wanna give a lil TLC<br/>
Cause Luda was set for life after 3 LPs<br/>
<br/>
Yep<br/>
<br/>
Still countin still climbin the charts<br/>
And rappers still talkin shit<br/>
Like they was rhymin in farts<br/>
I cross the finish line twice<br/>
They still tryin to start<br/>
But my infrared beam will make em shine in the dark<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
