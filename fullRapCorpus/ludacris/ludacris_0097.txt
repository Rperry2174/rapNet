<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

got to do with me me me<br/>
uh oh uh oh oh<br/>
got to do with me me me<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Listen,<br/>
I know you got a man, but your man ain't Luda<br/>
so please don't let him fool ya<br/>
cos the nigga don't really know how to do ya<br/>
who's your daddy rolling all up in the caddy<br/>
sun roof top with the diamond in the back<br/>
coming to get some of the bomb in the sack<br/>
like a bomb in Iraq Imma come and attack<br/>
every inch of your body after the after party<br/>
and then on to the hotel lobby riding me like a Ducatti<br/>
faster than a Bugatti<br/>
Im like whoa Kimosabe<br/>
Good golly shortie a freak or she been practising Pilates<br/>
I'm probably just stripping tongue sk-skipping like a track broke<br/>
but if she think I'm fronting just wait til she see my back stroke<br/>
haa, I be your side piece but whats our future plans<br/>
cause I be on ya like DAMNNN<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Flo Rida]</i><br/>
Hey, ok ok, so thats your mans and 'em<br/>
I aint tellin you to cancel him<br/>
do do your thing, look shorty I gotta respect your answer 'em<br/>
them there's your boyfirend, I just wanna be your toy friend<br/>
your other other man<br/>
not not your lo-lo-lover man, undercover man<br/>
how many rubber man's would it take for you lil mama to be apart of my plan<br/>
what do you need in advance,<br/>
I can see both of us showing in France<br/>
I can look back at your thong in my hand<br/>
Louis Vuitton no more Donna Karen<br/>
couple of stacks so what is you saying<br/>
like Denzel Washington "My Man"<br/>
I don't wanna hear no mo' more bout him<br/>
what it gotta do with me you grown ass woman<br/>
I'm a grown ass man so we both know a lot about the birds and the bee's<br/>
hold on shorty lets conversate, conjugate, constipate<br/>
get stuck on each other, you coming up outta your lingerie, hey<br/>
I know you got a man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Nada, nada, not a damn thing<br/>
he wouldn't know what to do if he tried it<br/>
and I ain't hating, you need some room to breathe and I can be your ventilation<br/>
you need a lil lovin' just a lil stimulation<br/>
a hug a lil kissing and then a lil penetration<br/>
give it to you like you never had it before<br/>
and you aint never gon think about his ass again<br/>
lips, hips, eyes, thighs here I'm gon have to give that ass a ten<br/>
and they can get a five even though one of them kinda fine<br/>
but ain't none of them got nothing on you you<br/>
so lets go somewhere to dine and sip some expensive wine<br/>
later on tell me what we gon do do<br/>
we gon bump and we gon grind so good it should be a crime<br/>
and next time tell your friends to come too, too.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
