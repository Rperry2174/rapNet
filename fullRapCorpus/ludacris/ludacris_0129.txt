("Money, forget the mo-ney")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
("Money") The root of all evil deceivin' <br/>
Cause even my closest people tryin' to get me for my ("money")<br/>
Cause envy breeds jealousy<br/>
Jealousy breeds HATE, they on the taste for the ("money")<br/>
Now where do I begin? <br/>
They send you out to reel you back in and it's all for the ("money") <br/>
Cause envy breeds jealousy<br/>
Jealousy breeds HATE, they on the taste for the ("money")<br/>
("Get you some, money")<br/>
<br/>
Hahaha, yeah...<br/>
My biggest gift and my curse<br/>
More money, more problems, tell me what's worse<br/>
Gettin' audited by the government, givin' up millions to the IRS<br/>
or havin' to take a paternity test from a BITCH I never met! (oh!)<br/>
I'm gettin' sued by my own family member (what?)<br/>
All cause my dog bit her<br/>
And she was the one who walked up and put her hand out and now she got her hand out<br/>
It's drivin' me crazy, almost as if this shit was planned OUT! (fuck~!)<br/>
What else can anybody do to me? It ain't new to me <br/>
when every time I turn around another money hungry motherfucker suin' me<br/>
Truthfully (ohh!) I've had it up to here<br/>
And it don't help that Forbes reports what I'm makin every year<br/>
They listen closely! And I was really simonized<br/>
that I was told to go to school, graduate and get a job<br/>
But I'm a hip-hop cash king, rapper from the South<br/>
And everybody wants the easy way out, and it's all for the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hahaha...<br/>
Yeah, rappers foreclosin' on their houses (fo'real)<br/>
Can't keep up the payments, they owe a couple hundred THOU-sand (oh!)<br/>
Say they makin' millions and bills steady pillin'<br/>
Diamonds on they neck, they kids' stomach out here growlin' (rrrr!)<br/>
Get your priorities in order nigga<br/>
You talk about it, but you really can't afford it nigga<br/>
That car you bought depreciated once you drove off<br/>
No wonder why baby momma wanna knock your FUCKIN' nose off! (BLAHH!)<br/>
Half the industry goin' bankrupt<br/>
You see 'em smilin' in the club with their drinks up (cheers)<br/>
Don't let that television fool ya<br/>
Off camera they sweatin' and stressin', my young students, let me school ya<br/>
The diamonds ain't worth half what you bought them for (no)<br/>
Soon all that Gucci don't fit and now you out of dough<br/>
One day your pocket's alright and now they all wrong<br/>
Fuck you gon' do when it's all gone? Talkin' 'bout the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Lemme talk to these hoes, woadie<br/>
<br/>
Uhh {"M-M-M-M"}<br/>
Uh, imagine bein' worth a 100 mil'<br/>
Your potentials of havin' a billion is only real<br/>
Images, more bitches and they named in your will<br/>
A new Mercedes, a baby, your aim was to chill<br/>
You choose a pussy or pop a bottle, grow half a mil'<br/>
All you wanted was some entertainment<br/>
All she wanted was some litigation<br/>
Exploitin' a simple penetration<br/>
Tellin' the courtroom that I'm being evasive<br/>
She wanted to walk into the SunTrust<br/>
She made me sign over my little son's trust<br/>
Take away the joy my little daughter brings<br/>
Bitch even wanted to take my daughter's rings<br/>
Misfortunes of a rich nigga<br/>
You watch BET while she look at the big picture<br/>
HUH! {"Maybach Music"}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
The best things in life are earned, not bought<br/>
Heheh...
