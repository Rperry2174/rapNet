<i>[Dru Hill]</i><br/>
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight... <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawnna (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
Ayyy, I can make that thang <br/>
go up and down like a rollercoaster<br/>
Make it go round and round <br/>
'til you make that sound, now let me hold ya<br/>
I kinda got somethin to show ya<br/>
I really wanna get to know ya<br/>
Shawty come and put yo' hands <br/>
all on my body like you 'posed to<br/>
Yeah, you pop one I'ma pop one too<br/>
It ain't no tellin what I'm gon' do<br/>
I'ma keep you sayin "Girl you got that good" (you got that good?)<br/>
Yeah, I got you screamin "Girl don't quit"<br/>
I'll make you ooh, like "Girl that's it"<br/>
Now gi-gi-give it to me like you should (like I should?)<br/>
Yeah, we can slow it down or speed it up<br/>
I love it when you flip it then beat it up<br/>
You know them other girls ain't sweet enough<br/>
So every time he see me he eat it up<br/>
Eat it up, eat it up<br/>
Don't slow it down baby keep it up<br/>
Keep it up, keep it up<br/>
I love it when you make it go deep enough<br/>
And I'm so gone I can't hold it in<br/>
Now one mo' round, can we go again?<br/>
I'm lovin each and every little thing you do<br/>
I kinda think I really wanna sing to you<br/>
Sing to you, sing to you<br/>
You got me in a zone when I think of you<br/>
Think of you, think of you<br/>
Now baby come and tell me what I need to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dru Hill]</i><br/>
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)<br/>
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight<br/>
Uh, said we're gonna take a ride<br/>
Up and down, front to back, side to side<br/>
Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)<br/>
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight<br/>
We're gonna take a riiiiiiiiide<br/>
Take a riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris (Shawnna)]</i><br/>
You got yo' boots, strapped up<br/>
and I got my ticket, got my ticket<br/>
And I'm ready for the ride of a lifetime<br/>
Is you wit it? Is you wit it?<br/>
Fasten yo' seatbelt, buckle up<br/>
Take two shots, double up<br/>
Play this song, pump it up<br/>
Then get a little closer, snuggle up<br/>
Take yo' time I'ma take my time<br/>
Sip a little somethin then relax yo' mind<br/>
Let's do it like we never did befo' (did befo'?)<br/>
Yeah, I got you screamin "Oh my God"<br/>
The headboard hit that wall so hard<br/>
Sound like somebody knockin at the do' (at the do'?)<br/>
Yeah, keep yo' hands inside the ride <br/>
when you up in the air and ridin high<br/>
Tonight it's on, I wanna hear you moan <br/>
when I put a little kiss inside your thigh<br/>
Put a little bass inside your ear <br/>
when I whisper and tell you that daddy's here<br/>
Daddy's here, the heat is on<br/>
and I love you with your little Vickie Secrets on<br/>
Even though I'll never let you keep 'em on <br/>
cause you pressed my button and the freak is on<br/>
Let's make it a night to remember <br/>
and bend that mattress that yo' sheets is on<br/>
Sheets is on, yank 'em off<br/>
And every little kiss I'ma make 'em soft<br/>
Yo' undergarments, take 'em off<br/>
Take 'em off so you can<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
On a rollercoaster ride<br/>
Up, down, front, back, side to side<br/>
On a rollercoaster ride<br/>
Up, down, front, back, side to side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sisqo]</i><br/>
Uh, ooooooh, huh, oooooh yeahhhh<br/>
Uh, cause we're gonna take a ride<br/>
Up, down, front to back, side to siiiiide<br/>
(Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight, hold tight)<br/>
Yeahhhhhhh, ha, Dru Hill and we're sayin<br/>
(Hold tight, cause we're gonna take a ride tonight)<br/>
Yeahhhhh yeahhhh yeahhhh-eh-eh-eh-eahhh, ohhh<br/>
(Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight, hold tight)<br/>
(Hold tight, cause we're gonna take a ride tonight)<br/>
Ohh yeah<br/>
