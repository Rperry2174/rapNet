<i>[Kelly Rowland]</i><br/>
I’ll be representing, representing<br/>
I’ll be representing, representing<br/>
<br/>
Luda!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 1]</i><br/>
You represent for bad bitches all around the world<br/>
The way you put it down in between the sheets<br/>
Is like no other girl<br/>
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness<br/>
When you blow my mind<br/>
To the point where all the other women<br/>
Kinda feeling like you stole their shine<br/>
<br/>
So I better come with it, then I better come spilt it<br/>
And I can admit that I’m feeling a little pressure<br/>
When you’re telling me I better come get it<br/>
But I’m the man for the job<br/>
Can’t nobody do it quite like I do<br/>
And the same go for you<br/>
We a match made in heaven<br/>
I’ma stand right by you<br/>
While you saying...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kelly Rowland:]</i><br/>
Just wanna keep all your attention baby<br/>
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)<br/>
It turns me on to know I turn you on, yeah, OK, OK, OK<br/>
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy?<br/>
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)<br/>
Sit in the front row and watch me perform<br/>
(You do that and you gonna learn today)<br/>
I’ll be representing, representing (get on that thang <i>[x3]</i> and represent)<br/>
I’ll be representing, representing (get on that thang <i>[x3]</i>)<br/>
Watch how I put it down put it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Put it down like ay,<br/>
Only know you can do it<br/>
Then I’ma hit every single one of your spots<br/>
And really you don’t need to walk me through it<br/>
But you can talk me through it<br/>
What I’m asking if it’s mine<br/>
Cause Imma be your motivation<br/>
Just tryna see if you can break my fucking spine<br/>
<br/>
I’m so attracted to the way you carry yourself<br/>
And keep your composure<br/>
You a lady in the street<br/>
But behind closed doors you’re a fucking soldier<br/>
A brother would never know<br/>
That’s how you like it ha,<br/>
But that booty pack a mean punch<br/>
And I’ma spike it, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 3]</i><br/>
You’re incredible, edible, unforgettable<br/>
Body is so angelical, a rebel with a cause<br/>
Speaking in hypotheticals<br/>
Could I marry you if I wanted to<br/>
I’ll take you how you coming<br/>
Just learn to live with your flaws<br/>
Even though it’s not that many<br/>
You give me that good and plenty<br/>
Then I walk around all day grinning<br/>
My mind and body are gone<br/>
That jj so sublime throw it in the air and turn to sunshine<br/>
You make me wanna call the crib<br/>
And say I’m never coming home, Luda!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
