<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
I know it's strange<br/>
But my brain's gone really insane<br/>
And I'm off the chain<br/>
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain<br/>
I feel like slappin a nigga today (slap slap)<br/>
Slappin a nigga today<br/>
I feel like slappin a nigga today (slap slap)<br/>
Slappin a nigga today<br/>
Slappin a nigga today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)<br/>
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)<br/>
I don't really wanna work, I'm tired<br/>
I hate my 9 to 5<br/>
And I'm thinking bout killin my boss today<br/>
Killin my boss today<br/>
I'm thinking bout killin my boss today (it's just a thought man)<br/>
Killin my boss today (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my best friend died (died)<br/>
Somebody came and took his life (life)<br/>
Now I'm looking up at the sky<br/>
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?<br/>
And I'm asking why did you take him away?<br/>
Why did you take him away?<br/>
I'm asking why did you take him away? (why'd you take him)<br/>
Why did you take him away? (hey)<br/>
<br/>
I need some money please (please)<br/>
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)<br/>
Cause I got a couple mouths to feed<br/>
My baby's in dire need<br/>
So I'm thinking bout robbin a bank today<br/>
Robbin a bank today<br/>
I'm thinking bout robbin a bank today<br/>
Robbin a bank today (real talk)<br/>
<br/>
Baby mama's at home and fussin' (fussin)<br/>
Callin up my mobile cussin' (cussin)<br/>
Always yappin about this and that<br/>
But she really don't be talkin bout nothin<br/>
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)<br/>
Take my pain away (please)<br/>
Somebody take my pain away (hey)<br/>
Take my pain away (I can't take it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)<br/>
Snatched up everything inside (inside)<br/>
Even got my 45<br/>
How am I supposed to survive<br/>
When I know that my stereo's taken away<br/>
Stereo's taken away<br/>
When I know that my stereo's taken away (I need my music, man!)<br/>
Stereo's taken away (hey)<br/>
<br/>
Gas prices are way too high<br/>
Rich people are way too fly<br/>
And I'm where I wanna be in my life<br/>
But why am I so behind<br/>
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away<br/>
Wasting my time away<br/>
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)<br/>
Wasting my time away (I can't help it)<br/>
<br/>
My grandmama's nerves are bad (bad)<br/>
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)<br/>
Cause President Bush could give a DAMN about our ass<br/>
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (don't say nothin)<br/>
Shit that he has to say<br/>
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say<br/>
Shit that he has to say (woo)<br/>
<br/>
Troops gone and we still at war (war)<br/>
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)<br/>
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store<br/>
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised man)<br/>
Tomorrow's not promised today<br/>
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (live like today could be your last man!)<br/>
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 4X]</i>
