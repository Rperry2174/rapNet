<i>[amazing intro...]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Luda!..<br/>
I done killed so many niggas in the booth,<br/>
I sell rappers on e-bay,<br/>
Soldiers couldn't cause more disaster on D-Day,<br/>
Haters better cover up their jon like freeway<br/>
Cause every hit record's been instant like replays,<br/>
Hold the line I got yo momma on 3-way,<br/>
Tell her Luda's got more records than a DJ,<br/>
Tell her she should blow me like candles on yo B-Day,<br/>
Cause I signed more lines than she's passed on the freeway,<br/>
Mo' checks than you ever could imagine,<br/>
Mo' wood up in ma wippin',<br/>
Than a forest full of cabins,<br/>
And yes I stay high on that purple like Aladdin,<br/>
Them women say I talk more game than Jon Madden,<br/>
How'd it happen how'd they let me in the booth,<br/>
How they let these rappers lie,<br/>
How dare I tell the truth!<br/>
I'm the truth, and these other boys phoney,<br/>
It's a movie so act like you know me...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Ludacris):]</i><br/>
I'm a lyricist till the death,<br/>
So I got what you need,<br/>
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dying breed,<br/>
And we almost extinct,<br/>
So I'm saying it loud,<br/>
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'<br/>
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'<br/>
Say it with me: 'MC means move the crowd'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ...ing]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I got it baby!<br/>
And I`m a MC,<br/>
I move the ground like Moses,<br/>
Like the Red Sea,<br/>
I wear red like roses,<br/>
Go against me and you be dead like roses,<br/>
Spittin` at yo head for the bread like toasts,<br/>
Never had a holdster,<br/>
I keep it on my lap,<br/>
And hip-hop ain't dead it just had a heart attack,<br/>
But you see I keep it pumping,<br/>
Yeah I got that hard back,<br/>
So just call me little carter,<br/>
Or little cardiac,<br/>
Precious like an artifact,<br/>
Valuable like a quarterback,<br/>
Hannibal like they call me Jack,<br/>
Fall back like a starter hat,<br/>
Now how did he thought a that,<br/>
I mean now did he think a that<br/>
I mean now did I think a that<br/>
Now like a rental bring-it-back,<br/>
I mean now did i think of that,<br/>
I surprise myself sometime,<br/>
Some one could throw me a suprise party for every rhyme,<br/>
Everytime I do it,<br/>
I do it dirty like swine,<br/>
For the dirty and fine,<br/>
Hip Hop I'm alive!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Ow, they say O'Reilly don't like him, nope<br/>
Oprah won't invite him, nope<br/>
The president denounced him no one will announce him, no!<br/>
Controversial lyrics like I'm cryin' for help<br/>
I'm very talented, but I should be ashamed of myself<br/>
<br/>
But this is my art, art, this is my music<br/>
I'm speakin' from the heart, hit record and I'll lose it!<br/>
Bite my tongue for no one, I'll put you on blast<br/>
So all the news channels, y'all could kiss my ass!<br/>
<br/>
And if I dish it I could take it, fix it if you break it<br/>
Could hit rock bottom and I'm still gon' make it, why?<br/>
Cause I'm a born hustler, natural survivor<br/>
Seed of a gangsta, I put that on my father<br/>
<br/>
YouTube or Google me, turn it up and play it<br/>
Cause many people think it, I just had the balls to say it, what?<br/>
And risk losin' everything, I stand for the weak<br/>
Plus I live for my freedom of speech, cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
