Gangsta whitewalls, TV antennas in the back (the back, the back...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
And I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
<br/>
diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper<br/>
Wonderin' how I can get me some<br/>
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch<br/>
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum<br/>
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses<br/>
But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes<br/>
And I was always reached for the sky, I dont know why<br/>
Ima little bitty kid wit' a whole buncha gangsta wishes<br/>
When I grow up, you just wait, Ima be so straight<br/>
And everything's gonna be so marvelous<br/>
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters<br/>
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges<br/>
Ima have it made in the shade, Ima be so paid<br/>
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills<br/>
Matta fact Im schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good<br/>
When I ditch these trainin' wheels<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Diamond in the back<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' in the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' in the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
And I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' in the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' in the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
<br/>
Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation<br/>
Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels<br/>
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes<br/>
In order to get myself some dollar bills<br/>
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box<br/>
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes<br/>
And I aint the only one trippin', or makin a fuss<br/>
My older cousin need some cheddar too<br/>
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick<br/>
It involves that local corner store<br/>
I overheard him say he knew who works there<br/>
And whatever they do, dont let the owner know<br/>
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change<br/>
At least for the summer<br/>
And if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want<br/>
Ima tell him I wanna...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Diamond in the back<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
Could use a (sunroof top)<br/>
Sho' wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
Sho' wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
<br/>
Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Why cant I walk with a limp mama? wont be no drama<br/>
For goodness sakes, Im just a kid<br/>
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'<br/>
Like there no remorse for what I did<br/>
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets<br/>
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal<br/>
"I coulda swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos<br/>
What I left to rob and steal<br/>
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', aint nobody givin' me nothin'<br/>
Find somethin' I love to do<br/>
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'<br/>
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw<br/>
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls<br/>
I'm adjustin' to my environment<br/>
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back<br/>
Why cant work feel like retirement?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Diamond in the back<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
Could use a (sunroof top)<br/>
Sho' wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wish I had a (diamond in the back)<br/>
I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
I wanna (diamond in the back)<br/>
And I wanna (sunroof top)<br/>
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)<br/>
<br/>
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta...
