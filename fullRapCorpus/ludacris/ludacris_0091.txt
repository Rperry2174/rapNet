Puff it pass it<br/>

Smokin' cheeba, twisted blisted, lifted puff it pass it<br/>

Smokin' cheeba, twisted blisted, lifted puff it pass it<br/>

<i>[Chorus - Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now I heard the ladies<br/>
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'<br/>
Do my fellas run this motherfucker?<br/>
(Hell yeah!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Female]</i><br/>
Now I heard the fellas<br/>
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'<br/>
<br/>
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Ludacris]</i><br/>
Luda!<br/>
On your mark, get set, put the music in the deck<br/>
And turn it up and let the system go<br/>
You done heard a lot of people in the past<br/>
But you never heard a nigga like this befo'<br/>
Ain't nobody better let the records show<br/>
If they outta order let a tec just blow<br/>
Over the border, I be in Mexico<br/>
Throwin' it up like an anorexic hoe<br/>
Anybody thinkin' like they just don't know<br/>
Tell 'em that Luda gotta electric flow<br/>
Come and see me live and I wreck a show<br/>
Sucka niggas better find the exit row<br/>
Extra cheese and the extra dough<br/>
And I'ma keep goin til the record's broke<br/>
So if you don't mean what you say when you spit it on a track<br/>
What the FUCK YOU RAPPING FOR?<br/>
Women wanna get me and I can't say no<br/>
So I get 'em fast and I sex 'em slow<br/>
But every now and then it get hectic<br/>
They holdin' on tight to a nigga and I gotta let go<br/>
Gotta go sign on the X with O's<br/>
Wrist gotta shine and my neck just glow<br/>
It's a man's world <br/>
And all you women I just want the rest to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now I heard the ladies<br/>
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'<br/>
Do my fellas run this motherfucker?<br/>
(Hell yeah!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Female]</i><br/>
Now I heard the fellas<br/>
They aight but they ain't hittin' on nothin'<br/>
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
