<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
10, 9, 8, 7<br/>
6, 5, 4, 3<br/>
2, 1 (uhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Never scared to be different<br/>
The improviser was put into existance<br/>
For in-stance, this is me<br/>
What did you expect from the 5th LP<br/>
Gone for a minute now I'm back again<br/>
Back to back, back to break backs again<br/>
Put 'em in the back seat of the 'Llac again<br/>
And rip off the Magnum packagin<br/>
What's happenin, I'm lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)<br/>
I'm just tryin to make these girls all smilllle (all smilllle)<br/>
And I'm gonna make 'em dance, so I<br/>
Can see 'em shake they ass, then I'll<br/>
Put 'em in a trance, 'til I<br/>
Get 'em out them pants, then I'll<br/>
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been to befo'<br/>
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below<br/>
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!<br/>
Fearless like Jack the Ripper<br/>
Hip-Hop needs help so I'm back to flip up<br/>
Flip and run 'em back cause I'm back to stick her<br/>
And flow up on the track like it's full of li-QUOR!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ludacris]</i><br/>
You're feelin kinda warm, like you was havin (sex)<br/>
You're wetter than a storm, like you was taxin (X)<br/>
Your mood intensifies, it's time for a surprise<br/>
So baby close your eyes, are you ready for what's (next?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
You lookin at rap's most consistant<br/>
Man, whatever they cain't do I can<br/>
What they wanna be in the future, I am<br/>
A hip-hop mogul's right where I stannnnd<br/>
God damn I'm good!<br/>
Stretchin out the limits of music, I should<br/>
Do it like I know and how only I could<br/>
Do it like a pro and how only I woullllld<br/>
Still I'm lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)<br/>
I'm just tryin to make these girls all smilllle (all smilllle)<br/>
And I'm gonna pour Patron, 'til I<br/>
Get 'em in the zone, then I'll<br/>
Get 'em all alone, 'til I<br/>
Make 'em wanna bone, then I'll<br/>
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been to befo'<br/>
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below<br/>
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!<br/>
L-U to the D-A-C<br/>
To the R-I-S and yeah that's me<br/>
A gift to read minds, got E.S.P.<br/>
Hottest thing on the go since PSP's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Wow, MC's I bake 'em<br/>
Put me in a circle of homies and I'ma break 'em<br/>
Mighta took your brain I'm in it to process<br/>
Take the whole game, I'm in it to top this<br/>
Just figured out that I'm ahead of my time<br/>
With a flow so fast I'm ahead of my rhyme<br/>
Your clock is off-beat, better set it to mine<br/>
With a six-year run havin a hell of a time<br/>
Cauuuuse I'm always lookin for some girls gone willllld (gone willlld)<br/>
I'm just tryin to make these girls all smilllle (all smilllle)<br/>
And I'm gonna get 'em high, 'til I<br/>
Make 'em touch the sky, then I'll<br/>
Make 'em wonder why, why<br/>
Why am I so fly, cause I<br/>
Take 'em to a level that they mighta never been to befo'<br/>
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo' you'll get hit below<br/>
I got somebody I want you to get to know - ME!<br/>
A millionaire with extra paper<br/>
If you haven't heard, go and ask a neighbor<br/>
I'm like hot sauce with extra flavor<br/>
So put it on your tongue for your mouth to SAVOR!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
