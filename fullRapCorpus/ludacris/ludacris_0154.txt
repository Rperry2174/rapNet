Na na na gonna have a good time<br/>
Na na na gonna have a good time<br/>
Hey hey hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yo, girl you taste like a cinnabun<br/>
So sweet from the thighs to the cheek<br/>
Sex on the beach check the size of my meat<br/>
Call me the pusher ludacris king ding-a-ling sheet smusher<br/>
Sweet street pusher give me that gusher.. nasty stuff<br/>
Looker I took her..ran out of liquor... (time to re-up)<br/>
Here comes her nigga (who give's a fuck)<br/>
Rap fame and plat thangs they can't hang<br/>
I mack dames and pack thangs and act strange<br/>
Jang-a-ling dang-a-ling oh no they can't stop<br/>
Take it to the floor back up and then drop<br/>
Effervescent.. time times of the essence<br/>
Make em undress in less then 3 seconds<br/>
So whore's keep steppin whore's keep slobbin<br/>
Sex as a weapon clothes that I slept in streets keep mobbin<br/>
Thieves keep robbin get two in yo butt three to yo noggin<br/>
Creepin and crawlin I'm incogneg<br/>
can't catch the balls then you in the wrong league<br/>
Let a dog breathe watch a pimp walk<br/>
Shut yo ass up when you hear a pimp talk<br/>
Risky and clean crispy of creams<br/>
You lookin mighty fine in them jeans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
All you brothas want a fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl (who, me?)<br/>
You know I gotta fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl (what do ya mean?)<br/>
It means I gotta fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl (fat as a bitch)<br/>
Fatty girl, fatty girl, fatty girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LL Cool J]</i><br/>
International baller baby...<br/>
Young birds in the coupe goin<br/>
(Papi tell me if you don't feel me)<br/>
Easy.. I feel greasy when you squeeze me<br/>
(Cause de blood claat talk can do if ya wan please me)<br/>
I'm talkin down home smothered in gravy cool J be<br/>
Havin young ladies bustin like 380's<br/>
Lubricated silencers crushin all challengers<br/>
Gats that be claiming they glocks but really dillingers<br/>
Get it?.. glock dillingers<br/>
I'm big you small.. more nuts on yo face than graffiti on the wall<br/>
Hair like brillo .. cuttin up my pillow got em sayin (hello)<br/>
Naked in a tub of a jello.. still no competition<br/>
Still flow nigga listen<br/>
(I'm not supposed to do this type of thing I'm a christian)<br/>
Amen .. its like a scene out of player's magazine<br/>
Let them other cats holla.. L will make you scream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keith Murray]</i><br/>
This isn't thought? of those broads who got the goods<br/>
To the chicks who don't and its still all good<br/>
Some broads got an automatic thickness for 8<br/>
You'll soon get it just stay workin hard at it<br/>
Goodness gracious good god almighty<br/>
You got a baduka girl don't hurt nobody<br/>
Toes all painted .. feet all out<br/>
Here's an aphrodisiac for the mall without a doubt<br/>
Juicy chunky stanky funky gut slappin ball slappin<br/>
Cater to yo every fantasy<br/>
You got the tongue clitoris tits and belly pierced<br/>
necklace around yo waist toe rings<br/>
Girl do yo thing<br/>
I mean in them jeans yo shape is beautiful<br/>
And everything is clean cut down to the cuticle<br/>
Whoo-wee Jesus JoJo K-Ci and Mary<br/>
Girl you don't know what you do to me<br/>
Ain't no doubt about it..<br/>
When she walk by tongues hang out eyes pop out the socket<br/>
(BING!) cats cringe and point like pssh ummph<br/>
You can see that thang from the front<br/>
We gas those up like full service<br/>
and keep 'em drunk like Kathie Lee Curtis<br/>
And when you shake it.. you rock my world<br/>
I done died and went to heaven.. you got a fatty girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat to the end]</i>
