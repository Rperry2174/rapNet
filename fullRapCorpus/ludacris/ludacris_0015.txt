Roll out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat 6x]</i><br/>
Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - "roll out!" in background]</i><br/>
I got my twin glock .40s, cocked back<br/>
Me and my homies, so drop that<br/>
We rollin on twenties, with the top back<br/>
So much money, you can't stop that<br/>
Twin glock .40s, cocked back<br/>
Me and my homies, so drop that<br/>
We rollin on twenties, with the top back<br/>
So much money, you can't stop that<br/>
<br/>
Now where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?<br/>
Where'd you get that matchin Benz with them windows tinted?<br/>
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin through?<br/>
Man I ain't got nothin to prove, I paid my dues<br/>
Breakin the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin a cruise.<br/>
Tell me who's your weed man, how do you smoke so good?<br/>
You's a superstar boy, why you still up in the hood?<br/>
What in the world is in that BAG, what you got in that BAG?<br/>
A couple a cans a whoop ass, you did a good ass job of just eyein me, spyin me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Man, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?<br/>
That's eighty-thousand bucks GONE, where in the fuck did you spend it?<br/>
You must have eyes on your back, 'cause you got money to the ceiling<br/>
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin<br/>
The better I'm feelin, the more that I'm chillin<br/>
Winnin, drillin and killin the feelin<br/>
Now who's that bucked-naked cook fixin three-course meals?<br/>
Gettin goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels<br/>
What in the world is in that ROOM, what you got in that ROOM?<br/>
A couple a gats, a couple a knives, a couple of rats, a couple of wives<br/>
Now it's time to choose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Are you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?<br/>
Playstation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo-kitted?<br/>
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?<br/>
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips, touchin lips to the top of the dick and then whewwww!<br/>
Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in your house?<br/>
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?<br/>
What in the world is in that CASE, what you got in that CASE?<br/>
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place  at a similar pace<br/>
So shake, shake it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[(Chorus) 1/2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Get out my business, my biznass<br/>
Stay the fuck up out my biznass, ah<br/>
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit and it's my business,<br/>
my biznass<br/>
Stay the fuck up out my biznass, 'cause it's mine, oh mine<br/>
My business, my biznass<br/>
Stay the fuck up out my biznass<br/>
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit.......<i>[fade]</i>
