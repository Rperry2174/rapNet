Uh, mic check 1-2 (Go get 'em)<br/>
Listen close, nigga, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Uh, if rappers want it, they can get it<br/>
Flow tighter than four fat bitches sittin' in a Civic<br/>
My flows are unimaginable, Hannibal Lecter shit<br/>
Eatin' emcees for breakfast, bitch<br/>
Since I was born to touch the mic<br/>
The first time it's been a problem<br/>
Your life was a mistake<br/>
Your pops should've wore a condom<br/>
You niggas think you hard<br/>
I think you better come harder (Go hard)<br/>
I leave rappers confused like will.i.am barber<br/>
Ah, fuckin' with Luda's not a great look<br/>
A verse'll make your fans unfriend you on Facebook<br/>
Click, my styles are goin' into labor<br/>
So if stars won a war, I made daddy like Darth Vader<br/>
And since I'm always high, it's kind of hard to overlook me<br/>
For over a hundred stacks, it's kind of hard to overbook me<br/>
And a whole 'nother house for my cars is on my checklist<br/>
Cause to fit 'em in one garage is like a nigga playin' Tetris<br/>
But they say patience is a virtue<br/>
Cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew<br/>
Guess I was a thief that got away with these words<br/>
Slangin' chickens out my whip like I been playin' Angry Birds<br/>
In a black Rolls Royce, Dark Knight like Batman<br/>
Everywhere you turn, the Ghost follows like Pac-Man<br/>
And I sleep with the John Dillinger<br/>
And always keep an eye half-open like Forest Whitaker<br/>
No, you boys ain't ready for combat<br/>
Be more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract<br/>
What path is he on? Opponents, I laugh and be gone<br/>
They handin' in the towels like they work in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond<br/>
But in the midst of all the melee<br/>
Y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh<br/>
Your rap styles are phony, your lines are just dead<br/>
And I be on them lines like a nigga just played<br/>
Guess I'm tryin' to say I'm advanced, you intermediate<br/>
You wouldn't know the real me if your bitch Wikipedia'd it<br/>
Just know that I never tried to be hard<br/>
Probably cause Mr. Glock 40's my security guard<br/>
You'll get chopped like judo<br/>
Gangs in my hood make you reverse<br/>
And change your color like the block's playin' Uno<br/>
And, yes, some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs<br/>
But I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud<br/>
They show me love<br/>
That's why I'll always stay reppin' until the death of me<br/>
Rappers talk shit, but ain't nobody ever stepped to me<br/>
I hereby command all my fans' to inject it<br/>
Overdose on Red Bull in your veins if you ever slept on me<br/>
Yeah, my mind is sharper than a guillotine<br/>
All the nines extended from the knuckles of Wolverine<br/>
Not a X-Man, but, man, I got that X<br/>
I'm on my hardest, switch labels, but I still get a cheque<br/>
The more albums they sell, the more we all win<br/>
And I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin<br/>
Or watchin' CBS in a Cadillac DTS<br/>
I plan to reach the world, man, your plan is MetroPCS<br/>
I changed my music up cause I was gettin' bored<br/>
You may not like the way I shoot, but my points go on the board<br/>
My name still engrained and these books will be the outcome<br/>
And this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas' albums<br/>
<br/>
Peace, fuck out of here, rewind that shit<br/>
Ha-ha-ha, Luda, ain't shit changed
