<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Can the church say Amen? (Amen reverend)<br/>
We gon' do another off in right now<br/>
We gon' do another one in fifteen minutes<br/>
And we gon' do one mo', right after that<br/>
Yes, women you lookin so very beautiful here today<br/>
Some of you with the same thang on from the club last night<br/>
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away<br/>
Oh Lord Jesus I wish you'd taketh away Sister Mary's wig<br/>
Oh you disrespectin the House of God with that thing<br/>
It don't even look real; aww, it's testimony time<br/>
Oh who is that?  Young Chris Bridges<br/>
Boy I'm glad you finally grew into them ears<br/>
Go on and testify<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Lord, please forgive me for the mistakes I've made<br/>
And thanks for keepin my momma safe when she wrecked my Escalade<br/>
See I could replace a Cadillac but I can't replace my momma<br/>
I'm sorry for the hip-hop beefs, we sorry for the drama<br/>
But you gotta understand us rappers ain't never had nothin<br/>
And one's loss is another's gain so we gotta grab somethin<br/>
Lord, got so many questions I need the answers to<br/>
And sorry for the thangs I put my baby's mama through<br/>
I feel that women are really the strongest human beings<br/>
but why do you make 'em so emotional, and other minor things<br/>
I guess it's your way of sayin we gotta love 'em and gotta praise 'em<br/>
cause without 'em we'd be nothin, plus our kids they gotta raise 'em<br/>
while we, out and about and seein what life has to offer<br/>
But if you offer a new life then what we need is better fathers<br/>
Either I'm smarter cause of my daughter or I'm just too dense<br/>
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin sense<br/>
And I've been...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One]</i><br/>
Searchin so looooong, I was lost in the clouds<br/>
I'm tryna stay strooooong, and make you prouuuuud<br/>
It took me some tiiiiime, but now I see<br/>
That Heeeee resiiiiides, in me yeahhhhh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Lord, forgive me for anytime a fan said I was bein rude<br/>
I'm only human, I'm not always in the best of moods<br/>
But thanks for givin the gift of rap to write my feelings down<br/>
And sorry for cursin sometimes but feelings make me shout 'em out<br/>
Forgive the people that wanna blame everything on rap music<br/>
If they didn't live it they can't relate or even adapt to it<br/>
Forgive those who don't think I'm great and wanna see me go<br/>
Forgive Oprah for editin most my comments off her show<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I know some people got a image to hold<br/>
But those who criticize the youth might just be gettin too old<br/>
We still travellin through life, findin what's right or wrong<br/>
I know some folks may not agree or even like this song<br/>
But I'm just speakin MY truth, cause I heard it sets you free<br/>
And my conversation's with God, even though he speaks through me<br/>
I'm smarter cause of my daughter, and I'm NOT too dense<br/>
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin sense<br/>
And I've been...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - over Chorus One]</i><br/>
I've been searchin so long<br/>
I admit that I've been lost in them clouds<br/>
I'm just tryna stay strong baby<br/>
You know I'ma make you proud<br/>
I know life is full of contradictions<br/>
I'm tryna become a better man<br/>
Prayin for redemption, each and every day<br/>
<br/>
(Hallelujah, as the choir sings)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two: sung by choir]</i><br/>
Searchin so looooong (so long) lost in the clouuuuuds (in the clouds)<br/>
Tryin to stay strooooong, and make you prouuuuud - make you proud!<br/>
Took me some tiiiiime (took me some time) now I seeeee (oh now I see)<br/>
Heeeee resiiiides, in me (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
(Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest in the house tonight<br/>
Came with some words of encouragement, Bishop Eddie Long)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two - repeat 2X, minus ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Bishop Eddie Lee Long]</i><br/>
What you just heard is real life<br/>
It's real life for you, it's real life for many<br/>
It's about where you been, yet at the same time you<br/>
Ay, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil<br/>
Yes I'm talkin to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil<br/>
Cause you realize HEY - it's, time to change right now<br/>
And in the middle of that I wanna say this<br/>
The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child<br/>
I understood as a child, I fought as a child<br/>
Hey, but when I became a man<br/>
I put away those, childish things<br/>
Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?<br/>
Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes<br/>
In the upper downtown, wherever it was<br/>
The people around you, the things around you<br/>
cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn<br/>
But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book<br/>
God called you a prophet<br/>
When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out<br/>
And it commands attention, it commands change<br/>
I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you<br/>
And in the midst when you're, starting to understand<br/>
that I caught the wrong message, and now it's time<br/>
I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God<br/>
He said, "Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation"<br/>
Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold<br/>
Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you<br/>
It's time to stop the killing<br/>
I said it's time to stop the stealing<br/>
It's time to stop disrespecting our women<br/>
It's time for us to come home and raise our children<br/>
It's time for us, to really mold our communities<br/>
It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion<br/>
But to get hooked up in relationship, with God<br/>
And the amazing thing about it<br/>
is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess<br/>
and you can tell God "I'm sorry;<br/>
I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing<br/>
I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right<br/>
And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me<br/>
And I may have done the things, that they said I did<br/>
But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be<br/>
and I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments<br/>
But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up<br/>
And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line<br/>
Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!"<br/>
You can't resist the change<br/>
And you're not condemned by your yesterday<br/>
If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny<br/>
Move, change, and be, now!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Three: sung by choir]</i><br/>
Searchin so looooong, lost in the clouuuuuds<br/>
Tryin to stay strooooong, and make you prouuuuud - make you proud!<br/>
Took me some tiiiiime (took me some time) now I seeeee<br/>
Heeeee resiiiides (Heeee resiiiides) in me (in me yeahhhhh)
