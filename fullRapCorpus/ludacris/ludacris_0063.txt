<i>[Hook (Pharrell / Ludacris):]</i><br/>
Shake your money maker<br/>
Like somebody about to pay you<br/>
I see you on my radar<br/>
Don't you act like you afraid of<br/>
Shh...<br/>
You know I got it<br/>
If you want it, come get it<br/>
Stand next to this money<br/>
Like - ey ey ey<br/>
Shake your money maker<br/>
Like somebody boutta pay you<br/>
Don't worry about them haters<br/>
Keep your nose up in the air<br/>
You know I got it<br/>
If you want it, come get it<br/>
Stand next to this money<br/>
Like - ey ey ey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Shake shake shake your money maker<br/>
Like you were shaking it for some paper<br/>
Took your mama 9 months to make you<br/>
Might as well shake what you mama gave you<br/>
<br/>
You ... you looking good in them jeans<br/>
I bet you look even better with me in between<br/>
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind<br/>
But yous a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind<br/>
I got j.o. on my right side pourin some cups<br/>
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't giving a fuck<br/>
<br/>
So feel free to get loose and get carried away<br/>
So by tomorrow you forgot what you was saying today<br/>
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get<br/>
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat<br/>
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jet<br/>
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Switch, switch, switch it from right to left and..<br/>
Switch it till you running right out of breath and..<br/>
Take a break until you ready again and..<br/>
You can invite over as many friends as..<br/>
you want to, but I really want you<br/>
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to...HEY<br/>
Luda...I'm at the top of my game<br/>
You want my hands from the bottom to top of your frame<br/>
And I...just wanna take a little ride on your curves<br/>
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and..<br/>
<br/>
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis<br/>
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius...YUPP<br/>
Call me the renaissance man<br/>
Get up and I stay harder than a cinder block man....HEY<br/>
I'm just a bedroom gangster<br/>
And I been meaning to tell you that I really must thank you when you..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Rock rock rock it and make it work girl<br/>
Please don't stop it until it hurt girl<br/>
You..you been looking a little tipsy<br/>
So if you could just shake it a little this way<br/>
See I'm a member of the BBC<br/>
The original bread winner of DTP<br/>
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad<br/>
Cause everybody in the camp is like OH MY GOD..she could<br/>
<br/>
