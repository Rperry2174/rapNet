Hey! Thank all you all for comin' out tonight<br/>
It was a beautiful night tonight and The Shizznit<br/>
Where pimpin' and dead, these hoes just scared<br/>
Thanks Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, all the niggas from the LBC<br/>
It was a beautiful night tonight<br/>
Oh, look at these fools, Ay! Security! Come get these niggas!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Luda (Snoop)]</i><br/>
Fresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach<br/>
Ready to relax, kick up my feet<br/>
Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I wanna do<br/>
Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)<br/>
Oh, nothin' just called, lookin' for some women that can fondle my balls<br/>
(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that<br/>
Gimme 15 minutes, and I'll hit you rite back)<br/>
Off to the hotel, I was ready indeed<br/>
Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed<br/>
Put one up in the air, the cops just stared<br/>
Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care<br/>
Got to the tele and I slid through the door<br/>
On to the elevator, hit the penthouse floor<br/>
And what would happen next only time could tell<br/>
Cause I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Ah! Damn!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room?<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Luda]</i><br/>
Now it was five B.A.P hoes and they look like trash<br/>
But one was midget, so we'll just say four and a half<br/>
I was stuck speechless, couldn't believe my eyes<br/>
What'd I do to deserve this unpleasant surprise?<br/>
And I was thinkin' to myself, "This is just my luck"<br/>
Then my nigga bust in like "What the fuck!?"<br/>
(Oh shit it's Snoop!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop (Luda)]</i><br/>
Who in the hell let them booger bears out they cell (Not me)<br/>
And what they doin' in ya' room? Nigga make 'em bail (Yeah)<br/>
Got some fine bitches, dime bitches on they way (Okay)<br/>
And told security, "Let 'em in, with no delay" (Ha Ha!)<br/>
So when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked<br/>
Don't mean to trip out, but bitch you all got to dip out (Dip Out!)<br/>
Catch the elevator up one floor<br/>
Presidential with the slidin' key for the door (Oh No!)<br/>
What the fuck goin' on? Shit, all around the world Luda, then its the same song<br/>
Them bitches was so ugly, I told 'em to go home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who let these hoes in my room?<br/>
(Man who let these hoes in my room?)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room? (Oh no!)<br/>
(Did you let 'em in?)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room?<br/>
(Well who let 'em in then?)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room? (Get out!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Luda (Snoop)]</i><br/>
Now, these chicks wouldn't leave, they was ready to clown<br/>
One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds<br/>
(No she didn't come through with a thong on<br/>
She did for the hell of it, big fat whale of it)<br/>
You can't separate me, I'm gonna separate you<br/>
Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew<br/>
(You filthy, nasty, sick in the head<br/>
Sittin' in my dressing room with dick on ya' bread)<br/>
She said "I want you to climb in this underwear, silly"<br/>
But I was turned off by her tupper-ware titties<br/>
(Fake bitches, break bitches, make bitches<br/>
Kick rocks, when they fucked up in they face<br/>
Tick-tock, you gots to get up out my space<br/>
Hey Ludacris let's get the fuck up out this place, let's bounce)<br/>
Then it got to my head, and somethin' reminded me<br/>
I know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly (Faggot)<br/>
(Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who let these hoes in my room?<br/>
(Who let these hoes in my room?)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room?<br/>
(I need to know, who let these hoes in?)<br/>
Who let these hoes in my room?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop, Talking]</i><br/>
Ay, ay you all gotta go<br/>
You all gotta get the fuck up outta here, ugly ass bitches<br/>
I don't understand how these bitches always get in my dressin' room<br/>
You know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Soon as I get off stage, it's 7 or 8 ugly ass bitches posyed up in my dressin room<br/>
And security act like they don't know who did it<br/>
I know you feel what I'm sayin', I'm my nigga around the whole world<br/>
We need to form a society or somethin'<br/>
Fat, gorilla, monkey mouth bitches cant get in our motherfucking dressing room or backstage<br/>
And if they do, we kindly put our foot up their asses<br/>
And re-direct them bitches to security dressin' room, you dig?<br/>
Sick of these ugly ass bitches bein' my dressin' room
