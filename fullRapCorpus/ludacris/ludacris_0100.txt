<i>[Radio DJ]</i><br/>
Battle of the sexes radio, <br/>
Where it is 12:45 in the<br/>
A.m n disturbing the pieces<br/>
Are in studio guests, <br/>
Our hotline is lit the fuck up<br/>
With people with relationship issues, <br/>
Caller number one yall I'm air,<br/>
<br/>
Yeah Man, yall tell me if I'm crazy<br/>
Because this girl in here trippin, <br/>
You know what I'm sayin, <br/>
I'm a real man, I take care of my<br/>
Home, I take care of my kids, <br/>
Pay all my bills, I mean I ain't<br/>
Gone lie, I may check a little<br/>
Female from time to time on<br/>
The side, you know what I'm talkin bout, <br/>
But what man don't, so how can I break<br/>
This down to her, <br/>
Ludacris how do you feel about<br/>
This particular situation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Get your money right Ladies<br/>
Learn to sign your own checks, <br/>
But don't call me after midnight unless we havin sex, <br/>
Don't ever assume nothin no man gone be a man, <br/>
A groupie gone be a groupie, a fan gown be a fan, <br/>
These tricks gown keep on trickin<br/>
Those hustlers gown keep hustlin, <br/>
As long as there's new couchy, dogs gone keep fuckin, <br/>
So don't be all up in my phone, replyin to womens pagers, <br/>
I thought your mama taught you, you should never talk to strangers!<br/>
Don't you ever ask no question that you really don't want the answer to, <br/>
So stop poppin off at the mouth, like Neno Brown ill have to cancel you, <br/>
Handle you, stop the ride, leave you on the avenue, <br/>
half of you, always wantin some nigga to pampa you and that'l do for him<br/>
But not for me, I'll probably baffle you, <br/>
And if he wants to act a fool, Il show em what the gat will do, <br/>
run along go find somebody to snitch on or go chit-chatter to, <br/>
Then your name will follow with A<br/>
What ever happened to... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Radio DJ]</i><br/>
Exact-del, that's just what she need-ele... <br/>
Damn Right player AIHT, thank you<br/>
For callin, next caller, <br/>
<br/>
Yeah I hear you<br/>
But, let's talk about the fake ass brothers<br/>
With the 24's but can not pay the note<br/>
On they lease, and my nigga with this<br/>
High style chains and I can't get him<br/>
To pay his damn child support, that's<br/>
Why we makin mo money and ownin our own property, <br/>
And right just as nice, so now, I guess if we want to, we can bare ya too now<br/>
<br/>
Interestin, Shauna you wanna<br/>
Stick on this one?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawnna]</i><br/>
Get your money right nigga's<br/>
Get a bitch that can keep up with you, <br/>
I'm tired of thinking to myself why in the hell did I ever fuck wid you! <br/>
Don't stup wid you, sick of your childish games and all the stuff you do,<br/>
I proberly mentioned your name, but true to the game, I've had enough of you, <br/>
I've seen your type before, doin the 4's all over the floor,<br/>
he's flashin his chain's, he's flashing his dough, he drinkin the<br/>
Fifths, then drinkin them all, <br/>
but what you don't know this nigga fraud <br/>
he can't even afford to smoke, <br/>
back in the hood all the hustlers and g's, no he's a joke, <br/>
that's why I treat a nigga, just when he eat it I tell him 'beat<br/>
It nigga' real bitches, true to the game, <br/>
That's how you G a nigga, <br/>
DTP stayin the zone, like we on PCP, <br/>
Chrome on the SS Shawn, I blow the PCP<br/>
Yall niggas ain't on my level, i do it so hood,<br/>
Pine apple an berry weed we feeling so good, <br/>
lightning is Sup-doo, I get my own stack, <br/>
that's why I leave them 200 i never call back, <br/>
<br/>
Thats right shawnna pussy rule the world!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Radio DJ]</i><br/>
Yes it does, next caller, <br/>
What's up<br/>
<br/>
Man what's up this is Marv, I wanna<br/>
Know the log that some body talk to<br/>
This triflin ass women like me, <br/>
I'm a good man but all these<br/>
Good men get treated like shit<br/>
Our friends callin at 3:30 in the morning<br/>
Marcus dont wanna talk about no numbers, <br/>
Marcus wanna talk about that ass, <br/>
And I ain't havin it, ya got someone<br/>
To talk to these women, because they<br/>
Need to be told, eye twenty you better<br/>
Talk to em, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[I-20]</i><br/>
Get your money right Ladies tell the man to get gone, <br/>
But don't you show up to my crib with your period on, <br/>
This is lesson one baby, Listen, how should I begin, em, <br/>
Ain't no such thing as a plutonic friend, <br/>
your lying to yourself if you don't think you want more, <br/>
so don't you call me insecure when he show up at your door,<br/>
you all claim to have substance, self respect and some class, <br/>
But half naked in the club, and steady shaking your ass, <br/>
Screamin I ain't done enough to touch you under your skirt, <br/>
But who the hell are you to tell me what my money is worth, <br/>
I'm on the streets and you trippin "I don't make you feel safe" <br/>
I stay at home and you complaining that you "think we need space"<br/>
I'm that sayin that its fair but thats the way that it is, <br/>
Ain't no nigga tryna marry you with four or five kids, <br/>
It may sound a little harsh but it's straight from the heart, <br/>
A nigga didn't write the scripts so I'm just doin my part, <br/>
Yeah, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Radio DJ]</i><br/>
Preach my brother preach, <br/>
I be woman that heard that, <br/>
And you better believe they did<br/>
And some millions of people listening, <br/>
That's our show for this year, <br/>
Good ladies and gentle man, <br/>
I got to get a piece of ass my damn self<br/>
AIHT, check at same time, same place<br/>
Tomorrow, Battle of the sexes radio<br/>
Signing off, good night!
