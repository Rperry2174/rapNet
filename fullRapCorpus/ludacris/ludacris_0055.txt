<i>[Small World X4 (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
Uhhuhh no way no how, get like blaow, blaow, blaow kapaow<br/>
(Yeah, you ever hear somebody sayin' something and you think they talking)<br/>
(Bout you, you not quite sho' Younasayin' but it aint no way they talking' bout)<br/>
(You, introducing the new membes of Disturbing Tha Peace: Small World)<br/>
(From Norfclk, Dolla Boi from Playaz Circle, Here we go What?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>

<i>[Small World]</i><br/>
3, 2, 1<br/>
What's begun, is the start but bitch we be saying we<br/>
"we just getting started it since one"<br/>
Y'all been monitoring, pondering bout it<br/>
How bout I, pull it out and kapaow, I'll heat em up out his mouth with it<br/>
Big Small World, Norfclk is the gang, extended clip in the jeans<br/>
Put em in a box like Bisquick<br/>
I'm a laker wit clips, get em in the lake wit clips<br/>
Truth is ya a clipper with clips aint cha bitch<br/>
I'm bout my loot and dollars, I'll shot you for looting dollars<br/>
But you lootless and dollarless, fuck it I shot for Luda n Dolla<br/>
I crash parties, blast with proposed toast<br/>
Im a have a problem like Scrap blat with me short of hoes<br/>
Muffle ya damn lips, or there be mixture of blood and dandruff<br/>
If you don't get my damn drift<br/>
Creep to ya grave and leak DT Piss<br/>
This is yo highness at his less tempered<br/>
Keep it pimpin' and watch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
Who the fuck you talking to?<br/>
Not me, Couldn't be me, Naw not me<br/>
Who the fuck you talking to?<br/>
Not me, Couldn't be me, Naw not me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dolla Boi]</i><br/>
I been having a bad day, the same ol shit<br/>
We don't give a fuck about who you is<br/>
The same ol clique, and the same ol biz<br/>
The same ol flip , wit the same ol whip<br/>
The same 4-4, with the same ol clip<br/>
Half the bullets gone, the otha half you can get, bitch<br/>
R.I.P. Rick James "I'm Rich Bitch"<br/>
You talkin' to much, nigga you a snitch bitch<br/>
And we don't do it like that<br/>
We do 3 quarter drops and we bring a brick back, black<br/>
Don't act get ya whole trap splat, ack<br/>
Unload em reload em, we back black<br/>
And when dem gats letting off<br/>
Red dots loud noises like planes taking off<br/>
Dolla Boi I got the game in a cross, make me bang at cha boss<br/>
For dem things coming soft, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
Who the fuck you talking to?<br/>
Not me, Couldn't be me, Naw not me<br/>
Who the fuck you talking to?<br/>
Not me, Couldn't be me, Naw not me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh<br/>
Now if a bad bitch wants dick, then its dick I give her<br/>
Ludacris nigga, I stand and deliver<br/>
Neva back down, won't shake nor shiver<br/>
Fuck with me and get found in the Chattahoochee River<br/>
This 7 inch shank, will put a stop to his ticker<br/>
But shoties to the body make him drop much quicker<br/>
Yeah I appear to be a nice lil nigga<br/>
Fuck with anything I love, I'm a stone cold killa<br/>
Eating off of 'Sace, sleeping on chinchilla<br/>
8 figga nigga, I'm a multi milla<br/>
See me in the street, it can't get no realer<br/>
Giving back to my hood with a pocket full of scrilla<br/>
My neighbors say my house can't get no bigga<br/>
I do good ass bidness, with a bad ass temper<br/>
Please tell ya bitch, stop playing with my zipper<br/>
Or I'll Brrrrddd Stick Her HaHaHa Stick HER!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
Who the fuck you talking to?<br/>
Not me, Couldn't be me, Naw not me<br/>
Who the fuck you talking to?<br/>
Not me, Couldn't be me, Naw not me
