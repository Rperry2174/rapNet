<i>[Hook - Ludacris(Big K.R.I.T.):]</i><br/>
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean<br/>
Every time I pull out a new whip I cause a scene<br/>
Rolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy<br/>
So whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me<br/>
(Come and see me) Come and see me<br/>
(Come and see me) Come and see me<br/>
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me<br/>
(Come and see me) Come and see me<br/>
(Come and see me) Come and see me<br/>
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
I'm talking Monte Carlos, Crown Vics, Cadillacs and Regals<br/>
If I get pulled over, everything I got's illegal<br/>
But I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun<br/>
Knowing that I need a meal ticket and I can't stop until I got one<br/>
<i>[Big K.R.I.T.:]</i><br/>
Shit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too<br/>
Hanging out the window front and central serving niggas like a late-night Wendy's drive through<br/>
Tweeters, speakers, jeekers fiendin', diamond in the back my nigga<br/>
I got two white girls, think I oughta have a curl in return of the mack, my nigga<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
It's the return of the 'Lac<br/>
Riding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo<br/>
Candy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'mma let my soul glo<br/>
Fleet, flickin', screaming, bitches, pitchin', counter, past fate<br/>
And all of the women get jealous cause of the way my car can make its ass shake<br/>
<i>[Big K.R.I.T.:]</i><br/>
Last to base, in the face<br/>
The law's right beside me, my window tint, dawg<br/>
My rims are too large<br/>
As soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me<br/>
Ridin', candy paint with two poles in the trunk<br/>
Popped up twice with two hoes in the trunk<br/>
Disturb your peace with fifteens that thump<br/>
Duck my slab get sawed off with the pump<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Big K.R.I.T.:]</i><br/>
I got two floors in my trunk, club lights in my trunk<br/>
I charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk<br/>
Cause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard<br/>
My wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, lord<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong<br/>
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on<br/>
My seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet<br/>
Suffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette<br/>
<i>[Big K.R.I.T.:]</i><br/>
007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho<br/>
I got all these alpine, it could turn a square chick ratchet, ho<br/>
Neon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho<br/>
Young and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Like a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan<br/>
Reach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin<br/>
I'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room<br/>
So I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Ludacris(Big K.R.I.T.):]</i><br/>
Okay now, ho, pour out that drinking watch me fire up that blunt<br/>
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk<br/>
(Don't make you pop your fuckin' trunk)<br/>
Don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk<br/>
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk<br/>
<i>[Big K.R.I.T.(Ludacris):]</i><br/>
Okay, now bow down when you see me, don't be trippin' on the thump<br/>
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk<br/>
(Don't make you pop your fuckin' trunk)<br/>
Don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk<br/>
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk<br/>
Hold up
