<i>[Intro: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
You know one thing I hate<br/>
It's when a person come up to me<br/>
Or I hear somebody say "it must be nice"<br/>
You know my answer that<br/>
Is "You must me a hater"<br/>
Tell me why you mad fo<br/>
Listen Luda we gotta keep it real boy<br/>
We gonna do it like this baby<br/>
Listen here you know what I'm saying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Come around the hood<br/>
See us sitting there looking good<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Cause you be on the radio<br/>
Sounding like you made a million dollars<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo, hah?<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Time to start putting grown-ass men on time out<br/>
Go to the corner and cry somewhere man<br/>
Old insecure ass nigga<br/>
Your heart pump Kool-Aid man<br/>
What you mad at me for<br/>
Is it cause I got houses on every coast<br/>
Or that I'm on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke<br/>
While they're blowing that smoke<br/>
I'm blowing a couple million<br/>
Making a killing stunting on impostors<br/>
Only rapper in the game with a Grammy and an Oscar<br/>
7-figure movie deals, 8 figure bank runs<br/>
And I'm still feeding the same hood that I came from<br/>
Any car that you got I've altready drove<br/>
Any chick that you hit, nigga I've already ho'd<br/>
Say it with your chest like these diamonds on my tongue<br/>
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm<br/>
Air traffic control say "Ludacris is insane"<br/>
That niggas daughter's birthday's the tail number on his plane<br/>
Fuck with me but nobody's fucking with me<br/>
Take in the sight of my cognac, more millions<br/>
Real G's chug it with me<br/>
If I'm happy there's no reason you should be sad for<br/>
So will somebody, can somebody please...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Come around the hood<br/>
See us sitting there looking good<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Cause you be on the radio<br/>
Sounding like you made a million dollars<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo, hah?<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Ha!<br/>
Is you niggas hating 'cause you mad<br/>
Or is you mad 'cause you hating?<br/>
Choose one, hater<br/>
Now if these niggas hating on me I'm a kill them dead<br/>
If I wasn't rapping I'd be probably be in the fifth<br/>
In the cell, getting mail, with a million dollar bail<br/>
But instead of counting blues, I'm a take this YSL<br/>
And this Gucci, and this Louis, Prada 'cause I'm hotter<br/>
I used to ball in Philly, with that nina and get dollars<br/>
I beefs up in my Bimmer, check aboard my collar<br/>
And when I check my bank account<br/>
I'm checking for them commas<br/>
I'm like all these niggas haters, all these bitches fucking<br/>
At 24 I went and bought a Ghost like it was nothing<br/>
At 25 I bought that Aston Martin, now we stunting<br/>
And you nigga still talking all this money shit you bluffing<br/>
You bluffing, you bluffing, I really think you bluffing<br/>
100, 000 dollars man them bottles we just crush 'em<br/>
Now tell me why you hating? You hating 'cause you mad?<br/>
Or is you mad because you hating, boy you sad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Come around the hood<br/>
See us sitting there looking good<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Cause you be on the radio<br/>
Sounding like you made a million dollars<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo, hah?<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Ok, I see why you mad, I'm counting all this money<br/>
And I'm popping all these tags,<br/>
Hopping to it, Fucking bunnies<br/>
Real nigga, One hundred<br/>
You trying to do it, I done it<br/>
I spit sick on this rap shit<br/>
Make them sick to they stomach<br/>
I'm clean man, you hate<br/>
Mad 'cause I'm gonna keep it real with a real nigga<br/>
I got racks on racks, and a black Maybach<br/>
Call it black on black, cause I kill niggas<br/>
In the club all girls, no niggas don't talk to me<br/>
'Cause I ain't really trynna hear niggas<br/>
In the coupe it's the truth<br/>
And the roof go poof, vamoose<br/>
I can make it disappear nigga<br/>
See this the type of shit that I be saying<br/>
Just because I'm balling, that don't mean a nigga playing<br/>
Haters can blow me like a fan<br/>
Flyer than a bitch, I don't think I'm a ever land<br/>
But in the meantime, baby what's your plan<br/>
You can call me daddy but I can't be your man<br/>
Fiending like the addicts, when I pull it out they panic<br/>
Bitch I do damage, you gonna need an ambulance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Come around the hood<br/>
See us sitting there looking good<br/>

Cause you be on the radio<br/>
Sounding like you made a million dollars<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo, hah?<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Showtime<br/>
Put one hand in the air if you know somebody<br/>
That's mad at you right now for no reason<br/>
Riding around in my jeep<br/>
Bumping that 2pac<br/>
I'm walking around in my hood<br/>
Cocked back two glocks<br/>
98 in my status<br/>
I came back I'm the baddest<br/>
Christian's on my feet<br/>
I told you I'm the baddest<br/>
All the way in Paris<br/>
Don't talk you'll get embarrassed<br/>
My watch is fucking nice<br/>
Yeah you get embarrassed<br/>
500 on them racks,<br/>
Pulled out them stacks<br/>
Mix this chocolate crazy<br/>
Droptop Maybachs<br/>
My life is just Ludacris<br/>
Sucka you just new to this<br/>
430s pulling up<br/>
God damn we do this shit<br/>
Chickens and the waffles<br/>
Chilling in the villa<br/>
Bumping Ludaversal<br/>
Getting that scrilla<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Come around the hood<br/>
See us sitting there looking good<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Cause you be on the radio<br/>
Sounding like you made a million dollars<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo, hah?<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Pusha T]</i><br/>
Yuck!<br/>
Hey Luda, you know why these haters mad fo right?<br/>
The truth shall set you free<br/>
If you sellin' all the records and you fuckin' all the bitches<br/>
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin' out your wishes<br/>
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered<br/>
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin' home to visit<br/>
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches<br/>
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business<br/>
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system<br/>
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison<br/>
Got you tweeting all stupid, is you skatin', is you dissin'<br/>
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented<br/>
Won't need it in your name like Pac when he went missing<br/>
Makaveli lives on so I'm riding on you bitches<br/>
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin' I was dealing<br/>
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling<br/>
Bullseye, be that motherfucking target for this killing<br/>
Ain't y'all the motherfuckers with the millions?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Come around the hood<br/>
See us sitting there looking good<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Cause you be on the radio<br/>
Sounding like you made a million dollars<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo, hah?<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo<br/>
Tell me what they mad fo
