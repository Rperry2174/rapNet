<i>[Hook: Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
Runaway love<br/>

Runaway love<br/>

Runaway love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now little Lisa is only 9 years old<br/>
She's trying to figure out why the world is so cold<br/>
Why she's all alone and ain't never met her family<br/>
Mama's always gone and she never met her daddy<br/>
Part of her is missing and nobody will listen<br/>
Mama is on drugs getting high up in the kitchen<br/>
Bringing home men at different hours of the night<br/>
Starting with some laughs - usually ending in a fight<br/>
Sneaking in her room while her mama's knocked out<br/>
Trying to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'<br/>
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her<br/>
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her<br/>
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own<br/>
Forced to think that hell is a place called home<br/>
Nothing else to do but get some clothes and pack<br/>
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
Runaway love <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Little Nicole is only 10 years old<br/>
She's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold<br/>
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her<br/>
Alcoholic step-dad always wanna strike her<br/>
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises<br/>
Teachers ask questions she making up excuses<br/>
Bleeding on the inside, crying on the out<br/>
It's only one girl really knows what she about<br/>
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends<br/>
Promise that they always be tight 'til the end<br/>
Until one day little Stacy gets shot<br/>
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block<br/>
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own<br/>
Forced to think that hell is a place called home<br/>
Nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack<br/>
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
Runaway love <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Little Erica is eleven years old<br/>
She's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold<br/>
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain<br/>
Plus she's having sex with a boy who's sixteen<br/>
Emotions run deep and she thinks she's in love<br/>
So there's no protection he's using no glove<br/>
Never thinking 'bout the consequences of her actions<br/>
Living for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction<br/>
The days go by and her belly gets big<br/>
The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid<br/>
Knowing her mama will blow it all outta proportion<br/>
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion<br/>
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own<br/>
Forced to think that hell is a place called home<br/>
Nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack<br/>
She say she's about to run away and never come back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
Runaway love<br/>
Don't keep on runnin'<br/>
Runnin' <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Don't keep on running<br/>
I know how you feel, I've been there<br/>
I was runnin' away too<br/>
<br/>
I will run away with you <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Runaway Runaway Love<br/>
Don't keep running away<br/>
I'll run away with you, if you want me too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I can only imagine what you're going through ladies,<br/>
Sometimes I feel like running away myself,<br/>
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes,<br/>
And picture us running away together,<br/>
When we come back everything is gonna be okay,<br/>
Open your eyes...
