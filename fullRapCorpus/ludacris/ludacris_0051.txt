<i>[Repeat 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Man I'm like a needle in a haystack so face that going back to the drawing board connect dots<br/>
But can't trace that Matta fact erase that cause I'm this late track get you face slapped and I'm<br/>
Straight so don't taste that try something different and shit I'm listening and shit speaking about<br/>
What hip-hop missing and shit I'm bout to fill a void Ludacris born in Illinois raised in Atlanta<br/>
Taught hamma since I was a little boy ain't nobody like me so they wanna fight me fight me step<br/>
To me now but it ain't like me people swear they sike me just cause he's light-skinned with braids in<br/>
His hair don't mean that nigga look like me trick get you mind right living in a limelight so<br/>
Picture what they'll do for my jimmy and a Klondike Bar Bar hardy hard tell yo mama I'm a ghetto<br/>
Superstar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Only 75 I make but still a bigshot plus I gotta big clean everyday stay fresher than whats in<br/>
A ziploc tell yo man to kick rocks when I make my pit stops I'm in then its hard to get me out<br/>
Like I'mma slip not Born to be a leader and not no not a follower only hang wit chicks that got mo<br/>
Twist than Oliver And I'mma tell my hollower would I like to borrow her lips bringing out the best<br/>
In me specially if she's a swallower freaky-deaky yellow man, and I'm sayin' hello man to all the lovely ladies that like to<br/>
Jiggle like jello man bigger booty small waist put me in a small place and if it ain't no ass<br/>
Where I'm at then I'm in the wrong place bells like a bondsman but keep 'em dancing got pop potential stay black<br/>
like Bob Johnson who the hell is that in that fancy car tell yo mama I'm a ghetto superstar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Jump down turn around<br/>
Pick a bale of cotton<br/>
Jump down turn around<br/>
Pick a bale of hay<br/>
Oh Lordy pick a bale of cotton<br/>
Oh Lordy Pick a bale of hay<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Still working like a slave<br/>
Learning tricks in the trade in the ghetto state of mind till I'm rich and I'm paid picking records<br/>
Like cotton in the thick of the day<br/>
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten and they send us away life no different that ozar minimum wage<br/>
Mo money but still locked in a similar cage either losers of tomorrow or we winners today, Now just that and theres<br/>
Really nothing missing to say but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
