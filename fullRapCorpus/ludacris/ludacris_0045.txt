Yeh, ohh!<br/>
Check me out, look<br/>
<br/>
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain<br/>
Fo' albums in the can and I'm STILL in the game (what up?)<br/>
And last album, they don't like me to tell this<br/>
Debuted at #1 and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)<br/>
That's what they tellin me, switch up your melody<br/>
Through with misdemeanors, they tryin to give rappers felonies<br/>
So they can lock us up one at a time<br/>
But true writers stay FREE in e'ry one of our lines<br/>
And if you not feelin I'm the cream of the crop<br/>
I'll KNOCK rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!<br/>
Still you lookin at a man that's financially stable<br/>
Only nigga gettin checks cut from four different labels<br/>
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts<br/>
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as FUCK<br/>
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody<br/>
It's cause I'm thinkin 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty<br/>
Me and Shaka still starvin and lookin for meals<br/>
And HEADS UP!  Ludacris is almost out of his deal<br/>
I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK<br/>
And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK<br/>
Mad rappers I hear you talkin way down at the bottom<br/>
Though I make big money, still handle small problems<br/>
The ramblin at the mouth, I don't PLAY THAT SHIT<br/>
I'm the best and I ain't really got SAY THAT SHIT!
