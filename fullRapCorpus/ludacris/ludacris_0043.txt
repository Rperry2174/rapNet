<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
DTP we got them guns that go...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[I-20]</i><br/>
Yea I'm all about that pistol player, cold blooded killer<br/>
Niggas recognize my name, I dub the young dealer<br/>
You better tell ya man that with the gages I'm nice<br/>
Ill shoot up you all white shirts until you all look like dice<br/>
But I'm through with all the talking time to show all you niggas<br/>
I 2-0, I'm like J-Lo...going through niggas<br/>
DTP we ain't playing if you try to get our pen<br/>
A.K's get to spraying like...<br/>
Bottom line that mean I'm bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it<br/>
Bust you in the broad day, on a street that's fully crowded<br/>
Find a hole inside your chest, just for thinking it's rap<br/>
And tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats<br/>
Chaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree<br/>
So you should watch what you saying if it's intended for me<br/>
So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking<br/>
And that Uzi get to talking like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tity Boi]</i><br/>
Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em<br/>
Can the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em<br/>
Press him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up<br/>
Bake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up<br/>
A-B-C-D-E-F shawty is you a G or what<br/>
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world<br/>
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl<br/>
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em<br/>
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle...<br/>
And I'm throwing techs like a NBA ref<br/>
I got, all gold guns like they came from I-RAQ<br/>
Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols<br/>
I point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya<br/>
And ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'm gonna click<br/>
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate<br/>
And I'm webbing choppers like heli-copters<br/>
You gonna need hella doctors, when the glok go...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chingy]</i><br/>
Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip that text be quick<br/>
20 over thurr, Tity over thurr, Luda over thurr, ain't no exit trick<br/>
Us you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks<br/>
Reload with the next clip, I'm the wrong nigga to flex with bitch<br/>
Come on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit<br/>
Put a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch<br/>
Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click<br/>
My pistol grip sound like this...now what<br/>
Who want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust<br/>
You all cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up<br/>
You all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra<br/>
We'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut<br/>
My wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone<br/>
So thurr for you should invest, in a vest for ya dome<br/>
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing<br/>
Beast the nick, but my cannon go...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Fuck a medic, we gonna call yo ass a taxi cab<br/>
Bleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad<br/>
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month<br/>
A.K. 47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps<br/>
Got killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group<br/>
But I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit<br/>
I'll peel your CAP BACK with the BLACK MACK<br/>
Till your BACK CRACK, cock the GAT BACK like...CLAK CLAK CLAK<br/>
Swallow a hallow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber<br/>
Yo futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar<br/>
I, do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long<br/>
Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song<br/>
My Shotguns are cold and hard, but my Desert is easy<br/>
And my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me<br/>
And for these fakers talking greasy, I'm starting the show<br/>
My Uzi got a drum roll, it goes...
