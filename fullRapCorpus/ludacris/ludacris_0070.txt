<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Billy Paul Sample]</i><br/>
"The time has come for bad things to end <br/>
The time has come for life to begin <br/>
The time has come for the war of the Gods" <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Luda Talking]</i><br/>
It's that time <br/>
I'ma take the subtle approach first <br/>
Cuz I'm just gettin' started <br/>
Let's go, look <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm the best and there's nothin' that you can do about it <br/>
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it <br/>
Even in the core of the streets you can't sway the youth about it <br/>
But keep runnin' yo mouth, and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it <br/>
I never claimed to be nothin' but who the fuck I am <br/>
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin' man <br/>
Understand, nothin' you did makes you better nigga <br/>
You claim the streets but the streets respect that cheddar nigga <br/>
Luda got twice as much, your life you can charge it to him <br/>
I fit four of your houses inside my daughter's room <br/>
And still have room for young Karma to play <br/>
Givin' back to the children of tomorrow for good karma today <br/>
So you can say what you wanna say and you can talk that talk <br/>
But real niggas ain't doin' no talkin' cuz we walk that walk <br/>
Album for album you can see I got a multi-million plan <br/>
So call yourself whatever you want except the multi-million man <br/>
Nigga! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[Sample]</i><br/>
"Lucifer, oh lucifer" <br/>
(Whatever you want except the multi-million man) <br/>
"God of evil, you're the god of pain" <br/>
(Call yourself whatever you want except the multi-million man) <br/>
"Lucifer, oh lucifer" <br/>
(Call yourself whatever you want except the multi-million man) <br/>
"The Darkness is where you find your light' <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
How many times is you gon' rap about bustin' your gun <br/>
How many times is you gon' trap without bustin' your gun <br/>
Only shots you ever took was subliminal to the general <br/>
Disrespectin' those doin' real time with real criminals <br/>
And I ain't never did a day in my life <br/>
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life, I paid the price <br/>
And the cost to be the boss, so you could rest your mouth <br/>
I'm universal, Luda never limits hisself to the south <br/>
I give a damn about your hootin' and hollerin', it ain't botherin' me <br/>
I hear you talkin', but you ain't made it to three <br/>
You know where I live but you ain't made it to me, you ain't made nigga! <br/>
I'm havin' a house party 'kid', come get 'played' nigga <br/>
You got played, my record label never jerked me <br/>
So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me <br/>
I feed of ya energy, my power's with God <br/>
So it's even better is you make ya diss record real hard <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[Sample]</i><br/>
"Lucifer, oh lucifer" <br/>
(Make the record real hard) <br/>
"God of evil, you're the god of pain" <br/>
(Make the record real hard) <br/>
"Lucifer, oh lucifer" <br/>
(Make ya diss record real hard) <br/>
"The Darkness is where you find your light"
