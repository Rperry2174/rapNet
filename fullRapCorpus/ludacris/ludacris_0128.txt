Yeah, ahh~! I'm ready to do it all over<br/>
My heart colder, hip-hop I'm part owner<br/>
Southern rap specialist, verses intelligent<br/>
Elegant, it's Ludacris, don't EVER question my relevance<br/>
No pun intended, if no one's offended, get offended<br/>
Don't get it twisted, guns can get extended<br/>
Ready to DIE for my respect, my value, my worth<br/>
Unequivocal, lyrical BEAST on every FUCKIN' verse!<br/>
I throw the curse just to stretch the emotions<br/>
Somebody said I'm washed up, I told 'em "Pass me the lotion<br/>
Cause the industry's dryin' up and these verses are moisturizer<br/>
Then hand me your favorite rapper and Luda will posterize him"<br/>
I'm dunkin' over you critics, dozin' off when I'm spittin'<br/>
My fans locked behind these bars, I put my life in a sentence<br/>
Good riddance, I wake 'em up if they step to the plate<br/>
Cause sleep's the cousin of death and I could NEVER relate!<br/>
Luda!<br/>
<br/>
See the only people I owe my loyalty to are the ones who made me question it<br/>
Loyalty goes both ways but never push a loyal person<br/>
to the point when they no longer give a fuck<br/>
There comes a time in life where you walk away from all the drama<br/>
and the people who create that shit - destroy what destroys you!<br/>
You'll never see all the great things ahead if you keep lookin' at all the bad things behind you<br/>
They say the hardest things in life is know which bridge to cross<br/>
and which ones to burn, so may the bridges I burn light yo motherfuckin' way!<br/>
("So what's the number one cause of all these problems?")
