<i>[Funkmaster Flex]</i><br/>
Yeah Dirty South baby - Ludacris<br/>
Shout to Shaka Zulu, my man Shawn Taylor<br/>
.. it's goin down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DTP]</i><br/>
Yeah, Funk Flex, Volume Fo'<br/>
Disturbin The Peace, Def Jam South<br/>
'Cris (yeah) you ready?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Oh it's my turn?  Aiight..<br/>
I got permission to put ya mamma in a headlock (what?)<br/>
She tried to jook me in a figure-fo' leg lock (ohh)<br/>
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock<br/>
or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock, and it's on<br/>
So stop the sweatin like a wristband<br/>
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand<br/>
I think I changed the definition of a hit man<br/>
Cuz I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!<br/>
We puttin holes in your residence<br/>
And lose anybody for the right president<br/>
We thugged out street niggaz with intelligence<br/>
So all that bullshit you yappin is irrelevant<br/>
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside<br/>
I'm a dentist makin women open they mouth wide<br/>
You be in jail still runnin it on the outside<br/>
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth riiiight, but who cares?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
I got my corner on lockdown<br/>
About to hold this whole block down<br/>
Ludacris tell um how the South sound<br/>
UUH BUDDAH-LAA AH, UH UH UH BUDDAH-LAA<br/>
UHH BUDDAH-LAA AH uh oh uh oh uh oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Comin to Shady Park is like a peep show<br/>
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes<br/>
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes<br/>
You'll end up missin more than Shaq when shootin free throws<br/>
They packin and bout to open up the dope spot<br/>
My neighborhood is stoppin cars like a roadblock<br/>
They movin' weight like Atlanta was movin boat rock<br/>
And catchin ums like seeun Muslims eatin pork chops - never happen<br/>
And meanwhile I been thinkin man<br/>
Niggaz been slangin tapes like they slangin 'caine<br/>
Cuz in the hood its gettin ugly like orangutang<br/>
So if you tryin to stop the hustle get the dangalang<br/>
Okay, we tryin to make our own White House<br/>
Paint it black and start yellin our fuckin pipes out<br/>
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out<br/>
They can't fuck with us niggaz you think they dyked out, so don't play<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Disturbin The Peace, we do that funky shit<br/>
Hey, what can I say?  We got a monkey clique<br/>
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit<br/>
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit<br/>
Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up<br/>
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up<br/>
Aint nothin nice a full house don't make you fold up<br/>
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like - <br/>
hold up, god damn - I need to say it on a megaphone<br/>
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone<br/>
These fools is tickin me off like fifty metronome<br/>
I'm takin all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!<br/>
Alright?  I got the pistol and the safe key<br/>
You betta tell your bitch to follow you to safety<br/>
How dare you wanna be heroes and chase me<br/>
It's Ludacris wont leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Funky shit oh<br/>
Do that funky shit oh<br/>
Do that funky shit oh<br/>
Do that funky shit oh<br/>
Do that funky shit uh<br/>
Do that funky shit uh<br/>
Do that funky shit
