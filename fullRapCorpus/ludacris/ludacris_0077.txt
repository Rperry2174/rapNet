<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris]</i><br/>
I keep a fresh pair of One's on my feet<br/>
And double deuces on the chevy<br/>
3's company the double 4's on my belly<br/>
5 hot amps speakers shake like jelly<br/>
So many wires in my trunk look like a bowl of spaghetti<br/>
Assault and batteries, but my trunk stay "everready"<br/>
Assault and battery if you scared you never ready<br/>
And yeah I went green, and 26's on the hybrid<br/>
Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids<br/>
Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time<br/>
Still my paint got more candy then your valentine<br/>
For 5 Mill I bought a lake front crib<br/>
Bentley Car cover lookin like a laced frontwig<br/>
Of course they hating cause they still riding the Martor train<br/>
Re-name the yacht but put the plane in my daughters name<br/>
Now that's karma so call me Daddy War Bucks<br/>
If you got money, I got more bucks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <br/>
Cause I got it, <br/>
All these haters wanna grill me<br/>
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me) <br/>
(YEEAAH BABY)<br/>
(And I'm up to no good) <br/>
Ayyy I wish a motherfucker would<br/>
<br/>
NEW YORK &amp; JERSEY COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would <br/>
L.A. &amp; THE BAY COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Ludacris]</i><br/>
LUDA!<br/>
I'm a freak like a scorpio<br/>
Custom hood scoops make the coupe look like Pinocchio<br/>
I'm rich bitch, I should drop cash<br/>
The inside of the Lac' look like a wood shop class<br/>
And these women gimme "Love" like it's tennis time<br/>
So many shoes that my closet look like Finish Line<br/>
So many acres that my crib look like Bermuda<br/>
So many diamonds the safe look like Kay Jewelers<br/>
That Spider about to drop my team said Luda get it<br/>
Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it<br/>
First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles<br/>
the car is all black like it got traded to the Timberwolves<br/>
And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining<br/>
but as the weather change my weed adjust to different climates (Okkk)<br/>
Green in the summer time, orange in the spring<br/>
Now it's black with that purp I call my whip the "Sac King"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <br/>
Cause I got it<br/>
All these haters wanna grill me<br/>
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me) <br/>
(YEEAAH BABY)<br/>
(And I'm up to no good) <br/>
Ayyy I wish a motherfucker would<br/>
<br/>
Chi-Town and Detroit, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would <br/>
D.C and B-More, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm fly enough to fly away <br/>
trouble I don't shy away<br/>
from it I annihilate suckers in they driveway<br/>
In church on sunday morning praying about what happened Friday<br/>
But them the consequences for coming at pimpin sideways<br/>
Now a days guess it pays to change<br/>
in cahoots with corporations making major change<br/>
With magnificent watches and amazing chains<br/>
Plush pad in Atlanta and L.A.'s the same<br/>
I'm balling til I'm bored with selections and assortments<br/>
of automotives worth a small fortune<br/>
of course it's the '72 Chevelle hardtop, '69 drop<br/>
60 carat piece you can barely pay your lease<br/>
Dude wanna talk new school tell him go ahead<br/>
drop head double R-Maybachs and corner sales<br/>
Swag got the ass, stack cash to the hair line<br/>
Fuck another car it's time to try an buy a airline<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <br/>
Cause I got it<br/>
All these haters wanna grill me<br/>
(But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me) <br/>
(YEEAAH BABY)<br/>
(And I'm up to no good) <br/>
Ayyy I wish a motherfucker would<br/>
<br/>
Miami to Alabama, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would <br/>
Phily and Boston, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Ayyyy I wish a motherfucker would <br/>
St. Louis to Tennessee, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Phoenix to V.A, COME INTO THEY HOOD <br/>
Ohio and Inidiana, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Mississippi to Carolinas, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
and little Rock, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Oklahoma to Louisiana, COME INTO THEY HOOD <br/>
Kansas City to Seattle, COME INTO THEY HOOD<br/>
Minneapolis to Milwaukee, COME INTO THEY HOOOOOOD
