<i>[Chorus 2x: Ludacris]</i><br/>
<br/>
Move bitch, get out the way<br/>
Get out the way bitch, get out the way<br/>
Move bitch, get out the way<br/>
Get out the way bitch, get out the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
OH NO! The fight's out<br/>
I'ma 'bout to punch yo...lights out<br/>
Get the FUCK back, guard ya grill<br/>
There's somethin' wrong, we can't stay still<br/>
I've been drankin' and bustin' two<br/>
and I been thankin' of bustin' you<br/>
Upside ya motherfuckin' forehead<br/>
And if your friends jump in, "Ohhh gurrlll", they'll be mo' dead<br/>
Causin' confusion, Disturbin Tha Peace<br/>
It's not an illusion, we runnin the streets<br/>
So bye-bye to all you groupies and golddiggers<br/>
Is there a bumper on your ass? NO NIGGA!<br/>
I'm doin' a hundred on the highway<br/>
So if you do the speed limit, get the FUCK outta my way<br/>
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober<br/>
and you about to get ran the FUCK over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mystikal over second chorus]</i><br/>
BITCH! Watch out, watch out, watch out<br/>
BITCH! Watch out, watch out, watch out, move<br/>
<br/>
Here I come, here I go<br/>
UH OH! Don't jump bitch, move<br/>
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?<br/>
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through<br/>
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down<br/>
I fuck the crowd up - that's what I do<br/>
Young and successful - a sex symbol<br/>
The bitches want me to fuck - true true<br/>
Hold up wait up, shorty<br/>
"Oh wazzzupp, get my dick sucked, what are yoouu doin'?"<br/>
Sidelinin' my fuckin' bussiness<br/>
Tryin' to get my baby child support soon<br/>
Give me that truck and take that rental back<br/>
Who bought these fuckin' T.V.'s and jewelry bitch, tell me that?<br/>
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck<br/>
But i'ma tell you like this bitch<br/>
You better not walk in front of my tour bus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[I-20 over second chorus]</i><br/>
Bring it, get 'em<br/>
<br/>
Too bad I'm on the right track<br/>
Beef, got the right mack<br/>
Hit the trunk, grab the pump pump, I'll be right back<br/>
We buyin' bars out, showin' scars out<br/>
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out<br/>
Grab the pills cuz we poppin tonight,<br/>
Beat the shit outta security for stoppin' tha fight<br/>
I got a fifth of the remy, fuck the Belve and 'cris<br/>
I'm sellin' shit up in the club like I work in the bitch<br/>
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggaz<br/>
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggaz<br/>
I'm from the D.E.C., tryin' to disrespect D.T.P.<br/>
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the V.I.P.<br/>
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in your body<br/>
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party<br/>
So move bitch, get out the way hoe<br/>
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
