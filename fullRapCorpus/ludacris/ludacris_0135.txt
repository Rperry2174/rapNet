Yeah<br/>
Did some movies and started missing this rap shit<br/>
Back to rap and starting missing them movies<br/>
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick<br/>
Get with one chick started missing them groupies<br/>
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober<br/>
Next year I got drunk and did it all over<br/>
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough<br/>
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff<br/>
I got rich and learned life was a bitch<br/>
Now everybody's after all of my ends<br/>
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)<br/>
When I was broke all love from my folks<br/>
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends let the story begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
The grass is always greener on the other side<br/>
Always searching for another high<br/>
The grass is always greener on the other side<br/>
Caterpillar to a butterfly<br/>
<br/>
Bye bye butterfly<br/>
Fly away<br/>
Bye bye butterfly<br/>
Fly away<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Start exercising and winning got me a six pack<br/>
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk<br/>
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back<br/>
My six pack reverted back to a gut<br/>
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit<br/>
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib<br/>
I used to be out partying every damn night<br/>
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids<br/>
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)<br/>
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame<br/>
Guess what I'm really saying<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted<br/>
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)<br/>
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back<br/>
Grew it back then started missing my fade<br/>
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground<br/>
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)<br/>
When you down and people give you the runaround<br/>
But feels great to know who really gives a shit<br/>
You cut the grass and the snakes will show<br/>
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)<br/>
We always searching what we never had<br/>
Always ignoring what's in front of our face<br/>
We've been conditioned to think<br/>
<br/>
