<i>[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]</i><br/>
Baby, I gotta, get you up out of<br/>
your clothes, your clothes, your clothes<br/>
It's somethin about the way you move<br/>
I just cain't let go, let go, let go<br/>
Baby, youuuuu've got me open<br/>
Baby, I just wanna make you mine<br/>
By the end of the night, end of the night<br/>
By the end of the niiiiight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
It's inevitable and incredible, listen, it's Luda!<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the night you gon' be wantin to marry a nigga<br/>
Cause I make 'em erupt like volcanoes, you just shake and you shiver<br/>
Get 'em up, get down, turn around and put your face in the pillow<br/>
Cut 'em up like Jason, just face it that boy Luda's a killer<br/>
Half man, half gorilla, beatin all on my chest<br/>
Pleasin all of your flesh, squeezin all on your breast<br/>
Givin you reasons to rest, and ain't never say no to papi<br/>
Wake 'em up like Folgers cause I fold 'em like origami<br/>
Hey mami let's get it poppin like Orville Redenbacher<br/>
The way you move once you started nothin could ever stop ya<br/>
Sweeter than Betty Crocker, and I'm ready to belly flop ya<br/>
Just mention today but for now I forever gotcha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
(Whoo!) Verse two, it's like this<br/>
<br/>
Gotta get 'em up out of them clothes, if I throw a couple dollars then pose<br/>
We could drink a couple bottles and go, and ride off in the Impala on vogues<br/>
And Rolls, gold is all on my neck, all on my wrist<br/>
So just let go of yo' hoe, don't hog her to death, lend her to Chris<br/>
Just for a little while for a little bit<br/>
Just wanna see her smile and get the bigger fish<br/>
She said that you had a little dick<br/>
Now how in the hell can she benefit from somethin like that?<br/>
I be up in that cat, make her put a hump in that back<br/>
Black, I swing low and sweet chariot, meet me at the Marriott<br/>
Key access, I'll be at the very top<br/>
Don't hesitate to stop the elevator either<br/>
I'll show you the ups and downs, you'll be my elevator diva<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
All I need is a couple hours baby, for real<br/>
<br/>
Come up out that Prada, Chanel, Chloe, Loius and Gucci<br/>
Escada, Dior, Fendi, that Masconi and Juicy<br/>
Rockin Republic, True Religions and Citizen's jeans<br/>
Your Jimmy Choo's are so sexy but Giseppi's is mean<br/>
La Pearla lingerie, ya panties and bra matchin<br/>
Put down your clothes and I'll put you UP on the latest fashions<br/>
Cause with cameras and action, I'm a deadly assassin<br/>
I love your clothes but what's underneath I love with a passion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - over Chorus]</i><br/>
Gotta get you outta them clothes baby<br/>
Somethin about the way you move<br/>
I cannot let go, whoo!<br/>
You know you got me open<br/>
I just wanna make you mine, haha<br/>
By the end of the night, you gon' be mine<br/>
Luda!  And Valentin' the dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bobby Valentino + (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
Don't leave your girl round me (guard your women fellas)<br/>
Said don't leave your girl round me (Disturbin' Tha Peace)<br/>
Don't leave your girl round me (yeah, whoo!)<br/>
True playa for real, for real, for real, for real<br/>
Don't leave your girl round me<br/>
Said don't leave your girl round me<br/>
Don't leave your girl round me<br/>
True playa for real, for real, for real, for real
