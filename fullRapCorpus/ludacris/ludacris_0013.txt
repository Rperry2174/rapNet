Yeah yeah<br/>
It's an everyday stuggle<br/>
Trying to get out<br/>
Trying to get out<br/>
Trying to make it<br/>
Check this out nigga<br/>
What<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place<br/>
Bad luck is what resluts from my paper chase<br/>
I keep looking it ain't no dough<br/>
So I don't wanna look no mo what<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
I need to get away to another day or place in time<br/>
And find where reality can ease my mind<br/>
And shine on me like the sons of the earth<br/>
For what it's worth my turf is ruff and rugged so I gave birth<br/>
To a dream where cream lies between<br/>
All the dirt and the gravel so I battle to achieve my green<br/>
And still try to move forward at a steady pace<br/>
Cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase<br/>
So I erase the crime lies and sad cries<br/>
Wit sore eyes and keep mines on the uprise<br/>
But it don't work cause im steady getting jerked<br/>
By my neighborhood up to no good where bad niggas lurk<br/>
The urk me leaving effects that's too negative<br/>
So Ludacris is looking for a better place to live<br/>
And I can't stand it it's really got me buggin<br/>
It's like im in the war and I just keep on tuggin cause i'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I try to find a way outta this maze<br/>
It's got me crazed im in a daze<br/>
So many ways to boost into a different phase<br/>
But I can't think I can't do nothing<br/>
You think I'm fronting<br/>
You hear me grunting<br/>
Lord you ain't even saying nuttin<br/>
I need some currency before there's an emergency<br/>
Forget crimes I won't let my mind get the best of me<br/>
It's not gone happen I'm trapped in two worlds<br/>
On one side I see diamonds on the other I see pearls<br/>
It's a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides<br/>
So i'm gone with the wind and come right back with the tide<br/>
Cause I keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds<br/>
And when my mouth is shut up it makes my thoughts get loud<br/>
It's like a crowd in a stadium<br/>
Mils I be craving em<br/>
Money making schemes locked up in my cranium<br/>
Cause I need outta this critical situation<br/>
My mind's in jail I don't know the time that it's facing i'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm sick of knockin I'm sick of clocking<br/>
I'm sick of droppin in a hole never reaching my goal<br/>
It's got my soul seperated into pieces<br/>
It just increases<br/>
I'm hit wit anger like a cooked tit wit hot greases<br/>
So if you understood my attitude<br/>
Maybe you feel what i'm feeling<br/>
And then it start appealing<br/>
To ya intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations<br/>
Death by temptations even got my heart basting<br/>
So i'm tracing the line where I can find a better path<br/>
And make it last sit back and laugh before the aftermath<br/>
The tragic flaw is what makes it raw<br/>
So let it fall and i'll get through it even if I have to crawl<br/>
My way, I see the sun and there's no delay<br/>
And i'ma pray cause the lord will make a brighter day<br/>
Or will he keep me in his holding cell<br/>
But enough wit the questions the only story to tell<br/>
is that I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
