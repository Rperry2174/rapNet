<i>[Notorious B.I.G. sample:]</i> "I grew up a fucking screw-up<br/>
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fucking blew up"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Ludacris speaking over B.I.G. sample repeated]</i><br/>
Yeah! Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment<br/>
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY<br/>
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!<br/>
Yeah! Grew up a screw up baby<br/>
Got introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Ever since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out<br/>
Something in my brain said, "Wake up and kick out!"<br/>
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out<br/>
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out<br/>
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out<br/>
Peace up, A-Town down and then I dipped out<br/>
And oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out<br/>
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out<br/>
Somebody get him, the little nigga's out of control<br/>
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold<br/>
Gold gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent<br/>
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen<br/>
freshing freshing, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping<br/>
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections<br/>
Still the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan<br/>
And I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. sample variations repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Ayyyy<br/>
Y'all already know what it is<br/>
I'ma tell you nigga<br/>
C.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5<br/>
<br/>
Homey fronted me a sip, shit I made it a bird<br/>
That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word<br/>
Say the, ice is cool but them pots is hot<br/>
You better cook slow but that money come fast<br/>
I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash<br/>
You know the kid pimping all over the world<br/>
A hundred carats got me all over your girl<br/>
YEAH, five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag<br/>
A corporate thug, I run with a Playaz Circle<br/>
I got a Field Mob that'll +Disturb+ your +Peace+<br/>
Blowing Sean Jay, all we do is smoke<br/>
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'ma be all the way real with this, look<br/>
When I came into the game they ain't do nothing but doubt me<br/>
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothing without me<br/>
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown<br/>
Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down<br/>
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys<br/>
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's<br/>
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions<br/>
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons<br/>
From, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a<br/>
plane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA<br/>
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips, but harder<br/>
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK! Guard your<br/>
women dawg I went from ashy to classy<br/>
Went from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty<br/>
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars<br/>
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you're playing your cards<br/>
Boy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
