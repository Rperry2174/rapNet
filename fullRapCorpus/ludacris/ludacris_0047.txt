<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Heads Up! Heads Up! Here's another one.. and a.. and a.. another one.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) Why you all in my ear? Talkin' a whole bunch a shit that I ain't tryin to hear.<br/>
Get Back! Motherfucker You don't know me like that.<br/>
Get back! Motherfucker You don't know me like that!<br/>
(Yeek-Yeek Woop-Woop) I ain't playin' around.. Make one false move, I'll take you down.<br/>
Get back! Motherfucker You don't know me like that.<br/>
Get back! Motherfucker You don't know me like that!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
So, so, come on, come on. DON'T get swung on, swung on. It's the knick-knack-patty-whack still riding cadillacs. Family<br/>
off the streets, made my homies put the baggies back. (Whoo!) Still stackin' plaques (yep), still action-packed (yep), and<br/>
dope.. I keep it flippin' like acrobats. That's why I pack a mack, that'll crack a back, cause on my waist, there's more<br/>
heat than the shaq-attack! But I ain't speakin' about ballin', jus' thinkin' about brawlin' 'til y'all start ballin'. We<br/>
all in together now, birds of a feather now, jus' bought a plane so we changin' the weather now. So put your brakes on,<br/>
cats put your capes on, and knock off your block, get dropped, and have your face blown. Cause I'll prove it, scratch off<br/>
the music, like hey little stupid, don't make me looose it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I came (I came), I saw (I saw), I hit him right dead in the jaw (in the jaw). <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
See I caught him with a right hook, caught him with a jab, caught him with an upper cut, kicked him in his ass. Sent him<br/>
on his way cause I ain't for that talk, and no trips to the county.. I ain't for that walk! We split like 2 pins at the<br/>
end of a lane, we'll knock out your spotlight and put end to your fame. Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo' chain, and put<br/>
the booty of a swish at the end of a flaamme.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Hey, you want WHAT with me?!<br/>
I'm gonna tell you one time,<br/>
don't FUCK with me!<br/>
Get down!<br/>
Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose,<br/>
and I'm havin a bad day,<br/>
don't make me take it out on you!<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Maann, cause I don't wanna do that. I wanna have a good time and enjoy my Jack.. sit back and watch the women get drunk<br/>
as hell, so I can wake up in the morning with a story to tell. I know it's been a little while since I've been out the<br/>
house, but now I'm here.. you wanna stand around runnin' yo' mouth? I can't hear nothing you sayin' or spittin', so what's<br/>
up? Don't you see we in the club?, man shut the fuck up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Ah! We in the red light district!<br/>
Ah! We in the red light district!<br/>
Whoo! We in the red light district!<br/>
Ah! We in the red light district!<br/>
Whoo! We in the red light district!<br/>
Whoo! The red light district!<br/>
Whoo! The red light district..<br/>
Ah! The red light district..
