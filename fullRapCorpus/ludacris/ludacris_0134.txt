Mic check, 1 2<br/>
I'm just going to get right to it<br/>
Luda!<br/>
<br/>
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me when it come to getting lyrical<br/>
Murdering the rapper and killing beats nigga!<br/>
I'm cinematic making everybody panic<br/>
I be bustin' like a fully automatic feel the heat nigga!<br/>
We can battle in the Phantom in Atlanta the rover in Minnesota or the Arizona streets nigga<br/>
They sayin' all these offensive lines I snapback it's the quarterback sneak nigga!<br/>
One time for the sneak dissers Ol' puss ass fuckboys say my name!<br/>
Anybody coming at me know I never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame!<br/>
You lame<br/>
And my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day<br/>
They say Luda don't want it no mo'<br/>
No nigga I'm as hungry as the first day<br/>
What you want how you want it you can get I'm the definition of a real g from the south side<br/>
The crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape and the chalk and I'm leaving everybody outline<br/>
I'm all about mine<br/>
Getting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back<br/>
Used be like everybody is a lil kid now Big Boy, outcast like three stacks<br/>
Laying all it in the Cadillac with a red bone giving me dome my music on with the seats back<br/>
Ludacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight<br/>
Even if a nigga leak that<br/>
Timmy all up on the David Banner track with Janet Jack in the back like "Damn Luda freak that!"<br/>
Break it down like you dropping to the ground but we like the 808 in Atlanta so bring the beat back<br/>
Sample had to eat that<br/>
Couldn't control-alt or delete that<br/>
But put any other rapper on the track and I guarantee they'll never know how to treat that<br/>
I'm a boss I'm a king I'm a legend I'm a drill it in your head till you dose off<br/>
And I just so happen to be the type of rapper that make your women want to take her clothes off<br/>
So let's get to the action<br/>
Let's get to the show<br/>
I'm been getting to the Forbes list six year straight let's get to the do'<br/>
Shout out to the Luda Nation<br/>
All my fans just got live<br/>
And they waitin' for everybody to put me in the rapper category of ya top five<br/>
<br/>
Let me get it back<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I<br/>
Came in the game it ain't never been the same<br/>
Can't nobody do it like me<br/>
Is it ever gonna be another Luda you know that'll never happen that's highly unlikely<br/>
Knowing that I'm better than everybody you put me up against I'm in the hall of fame<br/>
So fuck call to call we can go bar for bar I'll put your name up on the wall of shame<br/>
And everyday is the same thing<br/>
Looking for another way for me to make paper<br/>
I think it's time for every single rapper to go to church<br/>
Whoever is my opponent you better pray first<br/>
They like "Luda why you rapping so fast?"<br/>
I'm like "Bitch why you listen too slow?"<br/>
I'm the truth in the booth and they can't keep up hardly cause I always hit em with a new flow<br/>
And the two door with the coup low with the Hublot off the window with the two low blades<br/>
From the top like judo listening to bruno on the way to school though getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though<br/>
Cause I'm numero uno and the crew know it's a couple loop holes when it come to fluke hoes cause some of they pussy bite like kujo<br/>
But back to the you know who<br/>
I can't stop till you tell me I'm the greatest<br/>
If you need a reminder then put the whole song on repeat and continue to play this<br/>
Better turn your stereo louder<br/>
Listen up and let me preach<br/>
And let's get arrested for disturbing the peace
