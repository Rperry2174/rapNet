<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar, you know who we are, cause we pimpin all over the world,<br/>
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar, you know who we are, cause we pimpin all over the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Sing it hoes,<br/>
All over the world baby, it's only right that I share my experiences with ya'll, cause I've been<br/>
Places where you'll never imagine, but Ima start at home, when I see a girl I like I walk straight up to her<br/>
And I'm like (ugh), Heyy girl how ya doin, you are the woman that I'm really pursuin, I would like to get<br/>
To know ya, can you gimme ya name, if you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, Heyy<br/>
See I'm the man of this town, and I hope you would'nt mind if I showed you around, so when you<br/>
Go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me, we got people to meet and many places to see, Heyy<br/>
I'm really diggin ya lips,but be careful where you walkin when you swingin them hips, I'm kinda<br/>
Concerned that you'll be causin a crash wit ya traffc jam booty, heads pausin so fast, Heyy<br/>
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it, I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it,<br/>
And how the colors cordinate wit ya clothes, from your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
You hear the song so dance, don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants,cause see me my<br/>
Pimpin's in 3-D, I'm takin you places you only see on T.V., tryna show ya that livin is trife,<br/>
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life, one day we on the autobahn<br/>
Swervin drivin, next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands, if you wit me ain't no time to<br/>
Sleep, especially at wet willies on Miami Beach, but I drive you off and pay you no attention if<br/>
I make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention, then jump in the car and just ride for hours,<br/>
Makin sure I don't miss the homecomin at Howard, Hawaii to D.C.  it's plenty women to see, so if<br/>
Yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Heyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade, then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin hand<br/>
Grenades, outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest, in Mardigra all the women tryna show me<br/>
They chest, Heyy<br/>
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks, while the ladies all beggin me to mash it up, I had sad<br/>
Beginnings when I rap wit no fans, now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Heyy<br/>
I used to think that it was way too cold til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes, now I<br/>
Hit the caribana every year in Toronto, then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago(ugh),Oh<br/>
Yet and still you would'nt believe your eyes if you went to Brazil, (where the best at) ain't no need of even askin<br/>
Brah, the best women are reside in Africa, and that's real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Sing it hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[$Money Mike$]</i><br/>
Pimpin pimpin pimpin, ladies and gentlemen as  we ride out, could we have all the real pimps,<br/>
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air, now ladies look around wit me, lets see if<br/>
We can weed some of these niggas out, cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin, no<br/>
If you happen to see a nigga wit two sweat patches up under his arms, look like he been swimmin<br/>
In shoulder height water, please tell that nigga, put yo hands down, if you smell like you been<br/>
At work all day and your car, please put your hands down, now look up at the pinky fingers that<br/>
Are still in the air, if you see him ashy around the knuckles, like the nigga wash half of his<br/>
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body, please say put yo hands down, if yo spinnin rims<br/>
Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin, if you are dancin on the dancefloor and you look to<br/>
Yo left and yo right and you do not see a woman in sight, guess what you guessed it you are not<br/>
Pimpin, if your Vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood, that's because you did'nt<br/>
Order Vodka buddy, that's why it's three dollars a glass, put your hands down, now look down, I<br/>
Need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time ok, you see the nigga wit the white socks NOT<br/>
PIMPIN! <i>[fading out]</i>, sorry unless you tryna do the Beat It entorauge, if your shoes have a buckle<br/>
On, your not pimpin
