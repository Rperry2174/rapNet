<i>[Fate Wilson]</i><br/>
Okay, I remember the days<br/>
High rights, low lefts, Even Stevens and Fades<br/>
Troops Lotto and BK's those was the days<br/>
High tech boots spray paintin' with you name<br/>
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same<br/>
They carry long chains<br/>
One gone but yo we miss ya'<br/>
Harris photos school shots can you remember<br/>
Bury him told his bitch go to the prom and die<br/>
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5<br/>
When she disobeyed hand off clated craze<br/>
Just to reiterate dog those was the days<br/>
Fo' the invasions of haters I ain't cool to mile around<br/>
Use to get down at True Flavas bumpin Key Lo<br/>
Walkin' Damage, Cross Colors, and Paco<br/>
While Playboys stepped at talent shows<br/>
Prom nights tux and cane know its so cool<br/>
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Keon Bryce:]</i><br/>
We were trying so hard<br/>
Hard to survive<br/>
Cause eventhough we were young<br/>
We had to stay strong<br/>
No matter what we went through<br/>
It was me and my crew<br/>
And that's how it went<br/>
When we were kids<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fate Wilson]</i><br/>
In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown<br/>
Hamwood and Diplomats<br/>
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats<br/>
We was lovin' that<br/>
Before to started jacking jacks<br/>
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through<br/>
College Park after dark<br/>
Crown Victoria's police unmarked cars<br/>
Be aware... Wayne Williams was out there<br/>
But we didn't care kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there<br/>
To busy playin'...Double Dare<br/>
You touched shorty on the ass that's a bet<br/>
Want ya Kool-Aid and sugar smack ya hands and say sweat<br/>
It's mine now place it in my Louie Vaton pouch<br/>
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch<br/>
Slout socks box Chevy Caprice<br/>
Hot knees cut the holes Disturbing The Peace<br/>
Wit no conscience broke niggas call em nonsense<br/>
No com-mission this is little fate payin' homage to College Park<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Keon Bryce]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I had a Long John but no Silver<br/>
No gold or plat<br/>
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back<br/>
With 2 sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches<br/>
And set fires in garbage pales and cabbage patches<br/>
A child of the corn been wild since I was born<br/>
Climbin' over barb wire clothes got torn<br/>
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy<br/>
Wherever I go they went they my buddies<br/>
I brush teef brush naps and cause treats<br/>
Dreamin' of Cadillac with wood wheels and plush seats<br/>
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats<br/>
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf<br/>
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for ACTION!<br/>
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one<br/>
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys<br/>
And be with the people making all that goddamn noise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Keon Bryce (x2)]</i>
