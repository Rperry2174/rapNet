<i>[Ludacris - imitating Austin Powers]</i><br/>
Yeahhhh baby, heh heh, yeahh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Back again (that's right) Luda! Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)<br/>
It gets meaner and meaner each time baby<br/>
Feelin real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face! (Yeah)<br/>
I'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)<br/>
Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)<br/>
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all<br/>
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm never goin nowhere so don't try me<br/>
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV<br/>
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy<br/>
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me<br/>
Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY<br/>
Hope all is well, kiss the plantiff and the wifey<br/>
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me<br/>
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me<br/>
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me<br/>
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)<br/>
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me<br/>
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)<br/>
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me<br/>
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee<br/>
Nobody light-skinded reppin harder since Ice-T<br/>
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)<br/>
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Alright)<br/>
Rappers swearin they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)<br/>
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)<br/>
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)<br/>
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)<br/>
Keep it goin it won't stop! (What you doin man?)<br/>
I'm comin for that number one spot!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada<br/>
Ready to break the steerin column on yo' Impala<br/>
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla<br/>
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha<br/>
Father, father, and hey I love gold<br/>
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold<br/>
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold<br/>
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled<br/>
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake<br/>
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake<br/>
I crush mics until my hand breaks<br/>
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight<br/>
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy<br/>
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+<br/>
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar<br/>
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Causin lyrical disasters, it's the master<br/>
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards<br/>
These women tryin to get me out my Pelle Pelle<br/>
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"<br/>
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin like Flo-Jo<br/>
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen ahh, boys and girls<br/>
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
