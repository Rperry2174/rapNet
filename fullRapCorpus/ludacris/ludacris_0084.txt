<i>[Hook - Jamie Foxx]</i><br/>
Simply marvelous - that’s what you are, that’s what you are, that’s what you are<br/>
More than outrageous, ooh ooh, that’s what you are<br/>
Beyond incredible - that’s what you are (yeah yeah) that’s what you are, that’s what you are<br/>
Now that’s contagious (ooh ooh) ooohhh, that’s what you are, (Luda) hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris]</i><br/>
I must admit that you are truly sumpthin’ special<br/>
So hop up in my vessel, let’s wrestle like I’m The Rock (Rock)<br/>
Deep in your ocean I’ma find your buried treasure<br/>
So hop up on the dresser throw your legs up to the top (top)<br/>
Stretch it out like calisthenics, better that Luda wet it and get it<br/>
And have somebody call the medic (Medic !!!)<br/>
My head is in the right direction, my quarter’s in your jukebox<br/>
Girl, you are my number one selection<br/>
I’ll play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder<br/>
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)<br/>
And I’m a soldier, see it ain’t no limits to the things we could do<br/>
And I made this record for you’z, and’a we can break it down <br/>
To the nitty gritty one time, and when it comes to the sexin’<br/>
I get busy with mine, do you get busy with yerrz?<br/>
I guess we destined to see, baby girl you a destine to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Jamie Foxx]</i><br/>
Simply marvelous - that’s what you are, that’s what you are, that’s you are<br/>
More than outrageous, ooh ooh, that’s what you are<br/>
Beyond incredible - that’s what you are (yeah yeah) that’s what you are, that’s what you are<br/>
Now that’s contagious (ooh ooh) ooohhh, that’s what you are, (yeah, uh), hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Ludacris]</i><br/>
So supernatural, wonderful and miraculous<br/>
You got me buggin’ off your attractiveness like whoa! (whoa!)<br/>
So precise, so fine in your position that my unanimous decision<br/>
Is to never say no (no), You got me strung like a guitar,<br/>
Playin’ the sweetest melody, is definitely heavenly by far (far)<br/>
Further than the moon, and I never fake it, but I take it<br/>
When you get naked cuz your body’s like boom (boom!)<br/>
How could I resist it, I’ll be there in a instant<br/>
When you call, like tornadoes you got me twisted<br/>
I know you missed it, so I’ma give it good<br/>
You’ll go ballistic, because I give it hood<br/>
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should<br/>
If you hear screamin’ then Luda’s up in your neighborhood<br/>
Good gracious, yeah I do it right, and all night you are… (back to hook)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
It’s courageous how you drop the phone and rush over<br/>
Crazy how you make me high when I’m sober<br/>
Just when I thought, I’ve seen it all, you put it down on me (ooh, ooh, ooh)<br/>
It’s contagious how your lips make me lose composure<br/>
Addicted to the kisses your blow got me swole up<br/>
There’s only one ?? That’s what you are to me…
