Some days I think I love my whip more than I love my bitch<br/>
Everytime we argue I just hop up in my car and split<br/>
And my car never talked back to me<br/>
It just turned up and played this track to me<br/>
And my girl getting jealous trying to wild on her<br/>
Calling her used cuz I actually got so many miles on her<br/>
And try to make her feel inferior<br/>
Since I'm rubbing on my Acura's interior<br/>
Whenever I'm with either of my ladies I just love her<br/>
See cuz one rides me while I ride in the other mane<br/>
I'm bout to go get in trouble mane<br/>
With the one that's like my sidekick the other thinks she my mother mane<br/>
And I ain't with that<br/>
They both got mean bodies but with this Maserati see how I trip that<br/>
Pretty feat with nice painting they both drop the top<br/>
And both stressing everythang in the parking lot<br/>
Gone
