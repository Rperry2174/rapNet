<i>[Spike Lee]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Hip hop nation, this is Spiz-ike Lee<br/>
Been sleepin for too long, wake up..<br/>
Wake up - WAKE UUUUUUUUUUP! <i>[rooster crows]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP! <i>[rooster crows]</i><br/>
I see the sunshine GAZING through the window pane (yeah) <br/>
Blazin like indo flame; it's to WAKE UP!! Come to yo' sense manye<br/>
Snow is all around you, but you don't play in the winter games!<br/>
Cartridges surround you, but you ain't playin Nintendo games!<br/>
Load 'em up and fill 'em up, to the top before you cock and aim<br/>
Tryna get from the bottom to the TOP, like the stock exchange<br/>
Shower shit and shave and hit the corner for a block exchange<br/>
Amazing what my people'll (DO), for some pocket change<br/>
But maybe this ain't the life that you chose (chose)<br/>
This is the life where you stay strapped <br/>
and pack a knife or end up with a blooded nose<br/>
Street survivor or survivor of the streets! (streets!)<br/>
And only the strong survive, there's no survival for the weak! (weak!)<br/>
Catch a sneak peak of DEATH if you ain't on ya Ps and Qs<br/>
They carry banana clips and niggaz'll peel you for ya shoes<br/>
It's the (Blues), but not on (Hill Street)<br/>
Hmm, you could call it, "kill or be killed" street<br/>
"Lost a pint of blood, let it SPILL" street<br/>
STOP AND WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! <i>[rooster crows]</i><br/>
WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! <i>[rooster crows]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
They say my folks'll do WHATEVER for the fortune and the fame<br/>
And it'll take a FORTUNE to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin <br/>
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
You say the only family that you got is in a gang<br/>
And the only way to make it is by sellin cocaine, but I'm sayin<br/>
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
Use your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Common]</i><br/>
I've been in this 'ere since we were drinkin beers<br/>
Years we've spent together, used to break up, get together, split a fight<br/>
Every night, gettin cheddar, movin white<br/>
Our thang, so we had to (Do it Right) like Spike<br/>
Holdin 40s, gettin green on acres, these broads were our mules<br/>
That's when we used to serve in front of Com'wealth School<br/>
Fuel for cars and jewels, chains and tools<br/>
It was (Organized) crime but we remained (Konfused)<br/>
Mom in the pews, singin, "Lord, protect 'em"<br/>
You might not a-gree with our views, but you had to respect 'em<br/>
Diamonds in the rough, but were we reflectin<br/>
a system that's aburpt, the streets, or no ?pressure?<br/>
One morning in the mirror, I seen my reflection<br/>
A young man with good spirits, but needed direction<br/>
I guess my man's death, was my (Ressurection)<br/>
'cause now I hear him sayin from heaven,<br/>
"Wake up! (WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUaaaahhhhh-)<br/>
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! (aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-up!)<br/>
Wake UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ Common rapping the 3rd+4th and 7th+8th line]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I, woke up this morning and got a call<br/>
My pot'nah said he had news about a girl named Baby Doll<br/>
She got fo' baby daddies - fo' kids by fo' different men<br/>
And she just found out she's pregnant, I said, "No, not again!"<br/>
Man, when she gonna learn she don't wanna spend her life in court?<br/>
Lookin for back payments and fightin for that child supports<br/>
Chasin checks, chasin her ounce of respect, chasin paper<br/>
Chasin entertainers or rappers and ballplayers<br/>
Not carin about a condom, I say, "Help her Lord, PLEASE"<br/>
'fore she stuck wit mo' babies or ends up fightin some di-SEASE<br/>
You know that you a momma and mommas, we cain't lose ya (no!)<br/>
Treat yourself better, you carry seeds to the future (whoo!)<br/>
And the future looks dim if we don't get ourselves together<br/>
We gotta sacrifice, some do WHATEVER for the cheddar<br/>
So make the right decisions 'til you ready to give birth<br/>
And know that you the most precious gift we have on this earth<br/>
Babies, stop and WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!! <i>[rooster crows]</i><br/>
WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!! <i>[rooster crows]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
They say my folks'll do WHATEVER for the fortune and the fame<br/>
And it'll take a FORTUNE to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin <br/>
Use your brain baby, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
Use your brain baby, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
You say you want a family but it's hard without a mayne<br/>
And the only way to make it is to get him fo' his change, but I'm sayin<br/>
Use your brain baby, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
Use your brain baby, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spike Lee - Outro]</i><br/>
Wake up, wake up..<br/>
It's a new day! C'mon brothers, wake up<br/>
C'mon sisters, wake up<br/>
ATL, wake up, wake up, baby<br/>
Chi-Town, wake up wake up<br/>
Brooklyn's in the house!<br/>
Wake up, Brooklyn!<br/>
Ludacris! Common Sense and ME, SPIKE LEE! <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
