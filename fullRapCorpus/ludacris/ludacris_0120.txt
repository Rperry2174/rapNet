<i>[Intro: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
What’s up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ludacris &amp; Jeezy x2]</i><br/>
Keep my name out your motherfuckin’ mouth (out yo’ mouth)<br/>
Keep my name out your motherfuckin’ mouth (out yo’ mouth)<br/>
Keep my name out your motherfuckin’ mouth (out yo’ mouth)<br/>
Keep my name out your motherfuckin’ mouth (out yo’ mouth)<br/>
‘Cause I was raised in the motherfuckin’ south (in the south)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Southside, College Park, yeah I rep that<br/>
Where there’s money, all my dawgs, go and fetch that<br/>
Niggas robbin’ in the hood, we don’t sweat that<br/>
Throw some some red dots up on your head and connect that<br/>
I guess you in the right place, at the right time<br/>
And I been drinkin’ I’m not really in my right mind<br/>
The wrong move’ll make a Nigga grab the right nine<br/>
Knock your livin’ daylights out, Bitch, night time<br/>
Come off up them stacks<br/>
If you don’t give ‘em then we gon’ take ‘em<br/>
Go and get ‘em or we gon’ chase him<br/>
Go stick him and might erase him<br/>
Or turn him into a patient, any demon’s we gon’ face ‘em<br/>
Or see all the pigs and all that bacon<br/>
We gon’ As-salamu alaykum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
These pussy niggas only talkin’ ’cause they got lips<br/>
Guess them choppers only bustin’ ’cause them bitches got clips<br/>
Got them niggas bustin’ off the motorcycle like Chips<br/>
Think I seen them round Bloods, so they mighta been Crips<br/>
All this rappin’ ain’t no action, see I can’t respect that<br/>
Bout to ask him for that trap, and nigga I’mma check that<br/>
Hundred units in the living room, and you can bet that<br/>
I’m so high up in this bitch look like I got a jet pack<br/>
If you a real street nigga, won’t you tell me how it feel<br/>
So bought some 26s before you played her like Bill<br/>
So keep your name up out your mouth<br/>
Gives a fuck bout how you feel<br/>
‘Cause in these motherfuckin’ streets, I Am Legend like Will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Ludacris]</i><br/>
These niggas is sweeter than a sweet potato<br/>
Softer than Play-Doh, hope bitch nigga, lay low<br/>
A-Town by the way of Illinois<br/>
And our blocks come together likeLegos, they know<br/>
Who I am, I’m the man with a plane<br/>
And a nigga with verses, blowin’ a rapper to pieces<br/>
Got a crew full of untamed dogs, and I’m thinkin’ that<br/>
I’m really bout to let ‘em off the leashes, (Roof)<br/>
I’m scratchin the surface<br/>
The nigga with the million dollar verses<br/>
These rappers are worthless<br/>
And all I really wanna do is piss ‘em off on purpose<br/>
I’m possessed, stick a needle in your back<br/>
Like a nigga doing voodoo curses<br/>
Givin’ them a two piece with a biscuit<br/>
And hell no I ain’t talkin ’bout churches<br/>
Get nervous, get robbed of your valuables nigga<br/>
Like I’m snatching your purses<br/>
And I got a couple urges<br/>
To clown on you niggas like a three ring circus<br/>
If you ain’t got no warrants<br/>
Then you best to believe it’ll be nose arches<br/>
So keep my name up out your mouth before I close your curtains<br/>
<br/>
