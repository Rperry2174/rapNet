<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop<br/>
<br/>
Now this is what they call poetry in motion<br/>
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screams with emotion<br/>
This my daily devotion, that verses stay deeper than the ocean<br/>
So hip-hop you owe me a promotion<br/>
Yeah, I do a little boastin’ and braggin’<br/>
What’s all the commotion and naggin’ about<br/>
‘Cause I’m still the champ in the south<br/>
‘Cause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin’ them out<br/>
Where they fired and these pink slips I keep handin’ them out<br/>
‘Cause this is Theater of Mind, consider it a sign<br/>
Of what’s to come next, my money’s just fine<br/>
Bank filled with dump checks<br/>
Terrorist threat flow, proceed to drop (bombs) like Mr. Funk Flex<br/>
But I don’t do it for the money, I do it from the heart<br/>
I’ll do it with the beatbox, I did it from the start<br/>
I’ll do it for the DJs, I’ll do it for the charts<br/>
The Van Gogh flow, Luda do it ‘cause it’s art<br/>
I do it for the fans, I do it on command<br/>
I do it for the front row, I do it for the stands<br/>
I spit it for the hood, I do it for the block<br/>
And since nine years old, I did it for hip-hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
So, I don’t do for the chains and the fancy drops<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
They say I’m so low key, I’m socially awkward<br/>
Only those that really know me are the ones that I talk with<br/>
They smile in the light, hate in the dark,<br/>
you call it beef, to me its's just a fuckin’ walk in the park<br/>
Because you are who you are when nobody is looking<br/>
That's who you are so when the cash and cars is gone, the day after tomorrow<br/>
Don’t be askin’ to borrow, ski maskin’ it hard, like the way you rap in your bars<br/>
I could ride on you and whoever, devise new endeavors<br/>
I’m as live as hive full of predators<br/>
Twenty thousands different species of bees<br/>
Some half poisonous sting, some just pollinating their leafs<br/>
It's just like rap, some will buzz some will attack, compromising their own life in fact<br/>
Sixteen years since my first sixteen, pardon the rest of my niggas<br/>
But I’m the best whoever did it<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, I do it for hip-hop<br/>
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop, uh<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Why we do it kid, I do it for hip-hop<br/>
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop, uh<br/>
I do it for hip-hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hip-hop, started out in the park<br/>
We used to do it to avoid the Narcs<br/>
I used to do it so the homeboy Clark can get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs<br/>
I used to rap to impress my friends<br/>
The past of time when I was gettin’ it in<br/>
Just so happens I’m so illegal with the pen, they ain’t want me to do anything illegal again<br/>
I lost a lot of dawgs to these streets<br/>
I got Grammy awards on these beats<br/>
Thank God for Cool Herc<br/>
Without this shit I probably would’ve got murked<br/>
Shout outs to Grandmaster Flash and the cash<br/>
And even Jaz bum ass<br/>
Hip hop helped me wash my rocks<br/>
These other rappers couldn’t wash my socks<br/>
That’s why I took the number one slot<br/>
The realest shit in rap comes from my voice box<br/>
Lord knows when I was on my clock<br/>
I probably never would’ve stopped<br/>
Thank God for hip-hop<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Both]</i><br/>
I do it for hip-hop
