<br/>
<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
And, hear ye, hear ye<br/>
Disturbing Tha Peace presents, "Theater of the Mind"<br/>
Get your popcorn, get your popcorn<br/>
You scoot over to the left a little bit<br/>
Single file line now<br/>
It's an extravagant event starring Ludacris<br/>
Please silence all cell phones<br/>
We're about to go on a ride!<br/>
Let the show beginnnnnn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Lights, camera, annnnnd<br/>
ACTION! Take 6, Ludacris, it's nice to meet ya<br/>
Blow the smoke in the air 'til I blow out your brain<br/>
Turn it up until I blow out your speakers<br/>
Gotta keep them Tweeters tweakin, gotta keep them woofers pumpin<br/>
Then I blow out one of these verses<br/>
Spit 'em in ya, got a million more comin<br/>
However you want it, I can give it but you gotta admit it<br/>
Other rappers talk it, try to walk it, Luda live it<br/>
Sign it and seal it, multi-mil' it, said it and did it<br/>
They give me sixteen bars on another nigga's song <br/>
and you know that I'ma FUCKIN KILL IT<br/>
Cause I'm the FUCKIN realest, when it comes to this rappin sheeit<br/>
Semi-automatic tongue when I spit another verse cock back, I'm packin beeitch<br/>
And I'm back and attackin with album six<br/>
Tell them other niggaz we see danger<br/>
Probably cause I got enough, albums to fill yo' CD changer<br/>
Gotta buy my whole collection, gotta beat my whole selection<br/>
Hit your neighborhood record sto', and you can get it in the smokin section<br/>
Now that's a coke connection, these fiends are addicted to it<br/>
No guts no glory, so that's my story and I'm STICKIN to it<br/>
<br/>
That's my story and I'm stickin to it<br/>
Here's my story and I'm stickin to it<br/>
Here's my story and I'm stickin to it<br/>
Here some stories and I'm stickin to it<br/>
Annnnnd CUT! On a good gate we're movin on
