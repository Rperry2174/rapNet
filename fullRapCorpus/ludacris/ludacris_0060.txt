<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo<br/>
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo<br/>
We sippin on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though<br/>
I drop you off at, Willoughby and Myrtle<br/>
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off<br/>
You seen me convince your homegirl though<br/>
<br/>
Plus she says her life is too hard<br/>
She says that she wanna come and build with the God<br/>
Promise that she gon' play her part<br/>
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart<br/>
And, she's damn fine, feet Hammertime, damn if I mind<br/>
Love is the bu-bubblin back of your waistline<br/>
I don't waste time, gotta GET GET ON IT<br/>
Just you and me, two glasses, sip on Patron and<br/>
in the club scene where I met Ms. Green Eyes<br/>
She walked by askin me, "Are you Nas?"<br/>
Why?  "If you was I'd be totally twi"<br/>
What's that?  "Totally with it, T.W.I."<br/>
Ha ha, well, here I am, yep I'm the man<br/>
Bartender put a Cosmo in that girl hand<br/>
So, here we standin before I begin<br/>
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem<br/>
Tongue skills, yeah I like that, now we on the right track<br/>
Straight to my Phantom, call Africa Black (brrrring)<br/>
Ever since then, she been yappin a track<br/>
Told her friends, now they hollerin behind her back<br/>
Sing!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo (that's right!)<br/>
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo (tell 'em, tell 'em)<br/>
We sippin on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though<br/>
I drop you off at, Peachtree and Myrtle (uh)<br/>
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off<br/>
You seen me convince your homegirl though<br/>
<br/>
Now I was, so fresh and so fly in diamonds<br/>
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shinin<br/>
Bling!  A little cute thing said, "What's yo' name?"<br/>
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain<br/>
Oooh ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up<br/>
BLAOW!  Ludacris in the ho-oooh-ouse<br/>
The needle hit the record, they was playin this song<br/>
All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON<br/>
Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance<br/>
While I'm laid back chillin in my b-boy stance<br/>
Could be a little pop lockin if your girl's top droppin<br/>
But watch for cockblockin on my coochie stock options<br/>
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track<br/>
Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that<br/>
honey in the black cause I'm feelin her curves<br/>
He looked down at what I had and said WA WA WORD<br/>
Why only serve one when we can serve up two<br/>
Then at the bachelor's pad, doin what the Virgos do<br/>
And these women so shy but get loud undercover<br/>
So we can have sex but I CAN'T BE YOUR LOVERRRRRRRRRRR<br/>
<i>[DEF breakdown:]</i> buck buck buck buck buck buck<br/>
Ah, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha ah ah-ah SING!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Doug E. Fresh]</i><br/>
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo (c'mon)<br/>
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo (c'mon)<br/>
Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo (c'mon)<br/>
We sippin on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though (that's right)<br/>
I drop you off at, Two-Fifth and Lex-o<br/>
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off<br/>
Seen you convince your homegirl though<br/>
<br/>
They got my voice for the record and my voice for the beat<br/>
Virgo proof baby run the streets<br/>
So let's go (let's go) let's go (let's go) for the beat<br/>
Let's go (let's go) it's the Virgo<br/>
Let's go (Nasty Nas) let's go (Ludacris)<br/>
And if you don't know, now you know - Doug E. Fresh
