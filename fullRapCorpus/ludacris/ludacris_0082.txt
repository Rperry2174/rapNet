<i>[Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Oh Oh oh oh oh oh<br/>

<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[Chris Brown]</i><br/>
I know what them girls<br/>
I know I know what them girls<br/>
I know I know what them girls<br/>
I know I know what them girls like<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett]</i><br/>
I know what they feel<br/>
Cause I'm breathing on the hills<br/>
And it's me that they wanna kill<br/>
Cause I give her what them girls like<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown]</i><br/>
I know what them girls<br/>
I know I know what them girls<br/>
I know I know what them girls<br/>
I know I know what them girls like<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett]</i><br/>
I know what they feel<br/>
Cause I'm breathing on the hills (HAHAHA!)<br/>
And it's me that they wanna kill (LUDA!)<br/>
Cause I give her what them girls like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Relax &amp; take notes,<br/>
While I'm put you up on game<br/>
Get a sweeter connect, as put up on cane,<br/>
But you should grab yourself a seat and Whisky Double,<br/>
Because the girls are the world ain't nothing but trouble,<br/>
They like a little danger, and might not admit it,<br/>
But, They on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,<br/>
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowing with swagger!<br/>
And that keeps all his women draped in Louis Vuitton Bags!<br/>
With Louis Viton pumps, look at them walk to 'em,<br/>
I like open toast straps, but SG talk to em!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett]</i><br/>
I wanna whole buncha girls to bring out the kryptonite,<br/>
Betta wear your cake, they bringing that kryptonite,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yea, we gonna take this to verse 2,<br/>
Some of them wanna a family, a sense of security,<br/>
A neckless, bracelet and all other types of jewelery,<br/>
So, shop till you drop em, till it makes you psychotic,<br/>
Here's a triple Black Card, it ain't tricking if you got it!<br/>
Others'll stay content if you be making them laugh,<br/>
Send em to the spa, a massage then bubble bath,<br/>
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in their hand,<br/>
And try any and everything they never did with their man, me!<br/>
So get loose and slide of those garments,<br/>
Show em whose the boss, cause they take orders from the sergeant<br/>
There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,<br/>
So in the sack, talk to me, bout whats on your mind,<br/>
I got plenty more to learn if you're invested in me,<br/>
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,<br/>
And for that I'll give you everything up under the sun,<br/>
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!<br/>
So if you can't take the heat, get the f***k out the kitchen!<br/>
Cause that ride or die man for his ride or die chick gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I say,<br/>
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!<br/>
So if you can't take the heat, get the f***k out the kitchen!<br/>
Cause that ride or die man for his ride or die chick gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yes! They want what they can!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Women, I love you all, theres just not enough time.<br/>
Believe that, if your man don't tell you how beautiful you are,<br/>
Your beautiful baby!<br/>
I love women so much, I have one,<br/>
Hahaha,<br/>
LUDA! Chris Breezy, this too easy,<br/>
SG what up!<br/>
Hahaha.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Oh Oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
Oh Oh oh oh oh oh
