Big Bada boom, Luda’s in this bitch<br/>
Pussy niggas clear the room<br/>
I came through the door, I said it before<br/>
I’m the truth in this bitch and you niggas all hoes<br/>
<br/>
Counterfeit rappers say I’m stealing their flows,<br/>
but I can’t steal what you never made up bitch<br/>
Y’all some duplicate rap cloning niggas<br/>
I manufacture you hoes put on your makeup Bitch<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain, nothing’s been new since Big Daddy Kane<br/>
Flows will get recycled passed around to different names<br/>
But what’s the same, that every verse I spit is insane<br/>
Got more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting<br/>
And ya’ll get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting<br/>
Who’s gassing ‘em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I’m just puff puff passin’ ‘em<br/>
Until they roaches, buried in my ashtray<br/>
Nigga burn slow, better pray like it’s your last day<br/>
You lying to yourself, just admit it<br/>
May not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy<br/>
Do your research before you make a claim so bogus<br/>
That's disrespecting pioneers in the game<br/>
Fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes<br/>
Then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants (sir, yes sir)<br/>
See I’m ya past, I’m ya future and ya present<br/>
So watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend<br/>
16 times platinum, 6 number 1′s<br/>
So I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week<br/>
You’s weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy<br/>
Don’t make me expose the truth, you’s a hoe boy<br/>
Don’t make me get on that Stomp shit and get back at it<br/>
You rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket<br/>
Why am I wasting my time<br/>
Yeah I admit I get a little Ludacris with my rhymes, sometimes<br/>
But my fans know the difference because “My Chick Bad” went platinum still winning muthafucka<br/>
<br/>
The nerve of you niggas man, you ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy<br/>
Fall back in formation, y’all outta line<br/>
I was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon<br/>
So the next time you nats got a real problem<br/>
Don’t be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to be going on twitter rants and shit<br/>
Nigga say it to my face
