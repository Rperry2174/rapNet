<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hey, before I eat an MC I say my grace<br/>
Leave you dead without a trace<br/>
Got a problem with me, say it to my face<br/>
To my face, to my face, to my face, to my face, to my face<br/>
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place!<br/>
Didn't your bosses ever tell you niggas you could be replaced<br/>
To the fans you's a disgrace, got a problem with me?<br/>
Say it to my face, to my face, to my face, to my face, to my face<br/>
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ay, got a chopper, kinda like a helicopter<br/>
For any nigga that think its sweet<br/>
And you better call a doctor<br/>
Have you shaking like a maracas<br/>
Dripping like this beat<br/>
Blood spillin' like a faulty faucet<br/>
Plug his ass, 'fore you end up in the host<br/>
Put the gear in reverse<br/>
Then you better hit the fucking gas<br/>
You broke, now you bitter<br/>
But how the hell is a nigga start beef with me on his fucking twitter?<br/>
You know where I'll be, you know where I'll stay<br/>
I ain't that hard to find!<br/>
All upon my D, when the DTP boy, you're sweeter than a valentine!<br/>
How can you call yourself a man, boy?<br/>
You's Ludacris number one fan, boy!<br/>
Then you left, and you're gone, goodbye<br/>
Lazy eye don't miss you!<br/>
Then you signed to a nigga, who signed to a nigga, who signed to another nigga, smart move!<br/>
Boy, you dumb as hell!<br/>
You should take your soul and have an 'end of the summer sale'!<br/>
But all your records my theme songs?<br/>
Why? cause I'm still shopping of your ring tone!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 2]</i><br/>
To you internet gangsta's<br/>
Facebook hoes, e-mail bullies, I can see your camel toe<br/>
Instead of talking to a nigga straight up, you rather send a text<br/>
Well, I think you a bitch, and you should change your sex!<br/>
Hiding behind your phone screen, better run the other way<br/>
You playing for the wrong team<br/>
Dick in the booty ass, nigga<br/>
Oh, take another dude to the movie ass, nigga<br/>
I can see you're Kit Kat, gimme a break, hit him in his face<br/>
How you keep it real when you know a nigga fake?<br/>
Better hit the brakes when you see me nigga shake<br/>
You going into convulsions, hater emotions and epileptic seizures<br/>
Put a nail in a nigga, your career is over, hang em up like Jesus!<br/>
Amen! Sayonara! Okay then<br/>
Next time you crying, tell a bitch, nigga!<br/>
But keep in mind, you's a bitch nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Put a pussy ass nigga in his face with that tooly on my waist like "huh?"<br/>
I put it to his face then I ask a pussy ass nigga how taste like "huh?"<br/>
He said it taste like nah (nah)<br/>
Told 'em it's a glock 10 though<br/>
Niggas thinking it's been a game til the shots hit his body bend his ass like limbo<br/>
Give my shooters your info<br/>
Tell 'em right to your place, put 'em right in your face<br/>
Nigga like what you say?<br/>
Catch you night time and then brighten your day<br/>
Shots at your head, they don't like what you say<br/>
Coroners coming to wipe you away<br/>
Thang you with jiggy? Here right the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Wherever you standing, that's right where you lay<br/>
Ya'll niggas run yo mouth just like a bunch of bitches<br/>
Pussy niggas talking just like a bunch of snitches<br/>
Lord be my witness, I ask for forgiveness<br/>
But if these pussy niggas keep running they mouth, I'ma give them the business<br/>
Heard you pussy ass niggas talking about me when I'm not around<br/>
Told another nigga, so he told another nigga and it got around<br/>
So I told the other nigga, go tell the other nigga, move out of town<br/>
Cause my dawg playing hard ball with the sawn off like you outta bounds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
