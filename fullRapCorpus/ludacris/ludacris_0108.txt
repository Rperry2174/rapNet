Ey! Save it for another day<br/>
I ain't try to hear that shit, no way<br/>
Hold up, Let me take two sips<br/>
And you can can miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Hold up, Let me take two sips<br/>
And you can can miss me with that bullshit<br/>
<br/>
You look like an a 8 figya nigga<br/>
Gone off the liquor<br/>
And I'm fired up like the booty of a swisha<br/>
Make the trunk shake like a california quake<br/>
And everywhere I go these bitches tryna take my pictcha<br/>
All white beama accentuated features<br/>
Talk around the rim like a fucking margarita<br/>
Cops profiling but I'm still wildin' hoping that they never find this cannibis sativa<br/>
Toke in moderation like niggers on probation<br/>
I break it like a record then I put it on rotation<br/>
Pass it like a test cause the system got me stressed<br/>
So when they stop me askin for license and registration<br/>
<br/>
I'm like<br/>
<br/>
Ey! Save it for another day<br/>
I ain't try to hear that shit, no way<br/>
Hold up, Let me take two sips<br/>
And you can can miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Hold up, Let me take two sips<br/>
And you can can miss me with that bullshit<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, pass the lighta I'm rollin like a tire<br/>
Yeah we bout to blow I got that bomb like Al Queda<br/>
The streets is not at ease so I keep a Desert E<br/>
And any given day you get that cannon like mariah<br/>
Yeah I rock the cradle, drop you like your label<br/>
I got so fired up some illegal like my cable<br/>
Try me and you wishin for a gang of ammunition<br/>
I'm handy with this cap people thinkin I'm disabled<br/>
Couple ladies with me cause I'm long like pippy<br/>
So you'll just find yourself like a minaj like Nicki<br/>
A sucka for them curves went over a billion serves<br/>
I said Bitch! get on deez and I ain't talkin about Micky<br/>
<br/>
She said<br/>
<br/>
Ey! Save it for another day<br/>

Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Hold up, Let me take two sips<br/>
And you can can miss me with that bullshit<br/>
<br/>
Problem's ova, driving on the shoulda<br/>
Bass booms trunk got that thunda like oklahoma<br/>
Woofers on them tweets my accura's got beats<br/>
My kicka's go hard, yeah my speakers got a boner<br/>
Crome kitted 5% tinted on the highway gettin head I told her push me to the limit<br/>
She got my balls sprung like a I hit a homerun<br/>
She make her mouth stretch like the fuckin 7th inning<br/>
So it, one, two, three strikes you outta there Luda got em playing with theyself like Solitaire<br/>
Birds of a feather supposed to stick togetha<br/>
But sick of women saying they friend look like Halle Berry<br/>
<br/>
I'm like<br/>
<br/>
Ey! Save it for another day<br/>
I ain't try to hear that shit, no way<br/>

Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>
Miss me with that bullshit<br/>

And you can can miss me with that bullshit
