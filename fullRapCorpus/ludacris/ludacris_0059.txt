<i>[Intro: ludacris]</i><br/>
Ooooh you feel that as i take you to them dirt roads deep in your southern roots <br/>
When nobody said life was going to be easy and we travel to this emotional roller coaster called life <br/>
And we have our ups and downs <br/>
Just keep in mind <br/>
When you hit rock bottom <br/>
There aint no where to go but up baby <br/>
Just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me.. listen here <br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
When life seems hopeless <br/>
It make a nigga lose focus <br/>
Empty beer bottles and roaches, helps to get it off my chest cause <br/>
Im so stressed and all i here is "fuck tha world" <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 1: ludacris]</i><br/>
Man ever since life been a gamble <br/>
My life been in shamblez <br/>
Double edge sword burnin both sides of the candle but cris but you cant handle the truth <br/>
Dont wanna face reailty <br/>
So lord accept my apology <br/>
Please like when police say freeze <br/>
And i aint do shit <br/>
But im down on my knees <br/>
Its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away i charge the game <br/>
And put my problems on layaway <br/>
A black man but i feel so blue <br/>
So i smoke green and purple til my dreams come true <br/>
Then my eyes turn red <br/>
Sky turns grey <br/>
Children slangin white in the hood <br/>
We call it yaay drink old gold <br/>
Down my yellow brick road <br/>
Then rewrite my script til my story is untold <br/>
See i got a little money and my life sped up now <br/>
Im fallin and i cant get up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 2: trick daddy]</i><br/>
I had to dream about a dope fiend <br/>
And its strange cause he can bearly write or read but seems to get folkz about anything curious about him <br/>
I wanted to talk to him but he was to busy fo that <br/>
But i was more then welcome to walk with him <br/>
As we walked <br/>
He talked and i just listen <br/>
He said theres a big differnce between crackas and niggas <br/>
See he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uh black folks blang wit tha black folks <br/>
When they aint enough black roakz <br/>
When you ooh to make a long story short <br/>
We need pay more attenion and do things that are more compleset and he told me <br/>
You kno i woulldnt say something that wouldnt work and i wouldnt damnwaste my time telling something that would hurt you <br/>
But you would fall for anything <br/>
If you dont stand for something <br/>
But thats for certain but niggas dont be listen and that shit be hurting <br/>
No all of us but some of us <br/>
And if we dont hurry up <br/>
They going to bury each and every one of us <br/>
And if we dont hurry up <br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus repeat 2x w/ trick daddy]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 3: ludacris]</i><br/>
Sometimes i cant deal wit my daily issues <br/>
Just being sober lifes a bitch and i cant control her <br/>
I wish i could and sometimes to cry on <br/>
We need a shoulder <br/>
The goverment stand us up <br/>
To run us over <br/>
And in the hood they dont seem to understand <br/>
God damn whats really got me wondering <br/>
Is if its a part of a bigger plan man <br/>
I smell some thing fishy goin on and its way beyond blowin away the smoke from these swisher <br/>
Goin on it aint much i can do about it but preach the word of telling my people to spend ya money wisely dont be obcared<br/>
By some things that depresiated like what like a home to open ya eyes to <br/>
Whats the fucks thats goings on cause the constantly getting rid of us one by one wither its drugs or diesase or gun by<br/>
Gun i aint no saint either i feel that im even doing wrong by usein this chorus to get thru this song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus repeat 2x w/ trick daddy]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[outro: trick daddy]</i><br/>
You know yall going to mess around and complain about slavery that was over 40 50 years ago black folks need to move on<br/>
Yall keep playin wit a crackerthey going to have yo ass tied up wired up to them back roads south florida and they made<br/>
Them laws say they cant do anything for you can a church get a amen and god for the thugs.
