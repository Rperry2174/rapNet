<i>[Preacher]</i><br/>
sister, mother so glad to see you<br/>
so glad your parol came through<br/>
so glad everybody came out this morning<br/>
we reading from the book of hush, today<br/>
verse sixty-nine, come on somebody, come on somebody<br/>
good to see all of you came out this morning<br/>
even though some of you just leave at one twelve<br/>
smellin like booty, and hennessee, come on<br/>
cabasille double shots, ha-hah, it dont matter!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Keep it on the hush, dont say nothing<br/>
Aint gone be no talking, while Im doing my thang<br/>
Keep it on the hush, dont say nothing<br/>
Aint gone be no talking, while Im doing my thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Im loving the way your legs go so far back, your one of those flexible girls<br/>
I figure your daddy always said you was one of the best in this world<br/>
But never the less in this world, Im just proffesional girl<br/>
I teach 'em a lesson, have 'em stressin and confessin the girl<br/>
How good it was, and how good it could be, if they just tried it<br/>
Taking my double dosage skip the daily dick diet<br/>
T-ried it, they so excited, and cant hide it<br/>
Im trying to do my thang, but you gotta be quiet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now even when i just come in your house <br/>
and cover your mouth because your momma is home<br/>
You grippin' the sheets and making a effort not to holler and moan<br/>
You got to keep it on the hush, cause we in no rush<br/>
You tellin' me its the little things that mean so much<br/>
And its an illusion to think you can match what I can do best<br/>
So if ya man call, tell him to put some hair on his chest<br/>
But he dont even have to know, we keepin it on the low<br/>
You walking it like a dog, and stay working it like a pro, so..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Imma taste ya neck, and begin to nibble around your earlobes<br/>
Down to your belly button, then im un-snappin' your bra <br/>
thinkin' your titties are tryna tell me somethin<br/>
Hard nipples, colder then ice-sicles<br/>
Workin' it with my tounge, you can just tell me if it tickles<br/>
Freaky deaky kinda sneaky, Ludacris and the gang<br/>
Disturbin' the peace, we runnin' the streets and steady slangin' them thangs<br/>
But you gotta keep the noise down, in order to keep the boy down<br/>
Its joy all around, and you know how it sounds, if you just..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat til fade]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Preacher]</i><br/>
As the crime scene evolves, the doors are open, the doors are open<br/>
<br/>
Look at you sister Johnson in the front row<br/>
with thongs on, your legs open tryna tempt me<br/>
keep it on the hush, i'll be over at about seven o'clock<br/>
keep it on the hush, shhh
