Stand up! Stand up!<br/>
Stand up! Stand up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ludacris and (Shawna)]</i><br/>
When I move you move (just like that?)<br/>
When I move you move (just like that?)<br/>
When I move you move (just like that?)<br/>
Hell yeah! Hey DJ bring that back!<br/>
(When I move you move) just like that?<br/>
(When I move you move) just like that?<br/>
(When I move you move) just like that?<br/>
(Hell yeah, Hey DJ bring that back!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - 1]</i><br/>
How you ain't gon' FUCK! Bitch I'm me?<br/>
I'm the GOD DAMN reason you in VIP<br/>
CEO you don't have to see ID<br/>
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali<br/>
BLAOW! We ain't got nothing to worry about<br/>
Whoop ass, let security carry em out<br/>
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless<br/>
Feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my neckless<br/>
I pulled up wit a million trucks<br/>
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!<br/>
Pass the bottles, the heat is on<br/>
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech &amp; Chong<br/>
What's wrong?! The club and moon is full<br/>
And I'm lookin for a THICK young lady to pull<br/>
One sure shot way to get em outta them pants<br/>
Take note to the brand new dance, like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - 2]</i><br/>
Go on wit ya big ass! lemme see something<br/>
Tell ya little friend he can quit mean mugging<br/>
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks<br/>
But where the FUCK is the waitress at wit my drinks?!<br/>
My people outside and they can't get in<br/>
We gon' rush the back door and break em in<br/>
The owner already pissed cause we sorta late<br/>
But our time and our clothes gotta coordinate<br/>
Most girls lookin right some lookin a mess<br/>
That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress<br/>
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts<br/>
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest-ahh<br/>
C'mon! we gon party tonight<br/>
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life<br/>
Don't be scurred, show another part of your life<br/>
The more drinks in your system the harder to fight!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Stand up! Stand up!<br/>
Stand up! Stand up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - 3]</i><br/>
Damn right the Fire Marshall wanna shut us down<br/>
Get us out so someone can gun us down<br/>
We was two songs away from getting some cutta<br/>
Now we one song away from tearing da club up<br/>
Move over! Luda got something to say<br/>
Do it now cause 'tomorrow' ain't promised 'today'<br/>
Work wit me! let's become one with the beat<br/>
And don't worry bout me steppin all over ya feet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Stand up! Stand up!<br/>
Stand up! Stand up!<br/>
Stand up! (just like that?)<br/>
Stand up! (just like that?)<br/>
Stand up! Stand up!
