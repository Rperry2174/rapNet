<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be <br/>
Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry <br/>
Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang <br/>
How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name? <br/>
Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session <br/>
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession <br/>
Start up ya own company, trademark the name <br/>
That's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change <br/>
Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps <br/>
Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks <br/>
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need <br/>
Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed <br/>
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered <br/>
Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard! <br/>
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be <br/>
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
But I can't hold my tounge <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
This biz ain't all fun <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Give it to ya straight, no chase <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Look you straight in yo face <br/>
And I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
<br/>
I can't hold my tounge <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
This biz ain't all fun <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Give it to ya straight, no chase <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Look you straight in yo face <br/>
And I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
See, mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems <br/>
The money could be the problem, but money can't solve 'em <br/>
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy <br/>
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy <br/>
I'm close 'cause those close wanna live off my fame <br/>
And that type of shit alone will drive a nigga insane <br/>
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandelous promoters <br/>
Crabs will try to sue ya, magazines will misquote ya <br/>
Most of these label-heads, they don't care nothin' about ya <br/>
If you stop sellin' records, they'll act like they don't know ya <br/>
It's hard mixin' business with pleasure, so don't play <br/>
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other day <br/>
Rappers ain't above the law, but our life is so fast <br/>
That we got a Special Task Force of police on our ass <br/>
All that, and this is really just the start of it <br/>
Hip Hop, you really wanna be a part of it? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I can't hold my tounge <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
This biz ain't all fun <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Give it to ya straight, no chase <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Look you straight in yo face <br/>
And I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
<br/>
I can't hold my tounge <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Man this biz ain't all fun <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
I'ma give it to ya straight, no chase <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Look you straight in yo face <br/>
And I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
What's worse than havin' no money is havin' it and losin' it <br/>
What's worse than havin' some money is grabbin' and abusin' it <br/>
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool wit him <br/>
I wish his ass well, but I don't want nothin' to do with him! <br/>
Some don't own they publishin', me I never fool wit 'em <br/>
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em <br/>
'Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant <br/>
Unless I'm still in competition with my president <br/>
And believe that I'm supportin' the Hova <br/>
''Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over' <br/>
But the first rule to accumalation of wealth <br/>
Is Don't trust nobody but ya God damned self! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I can't hold my tounge <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Man this biz ain't all fun <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
I'm give it to ya straight, no chase <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Look you straight in yo face <br/>
And I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
<br/>
I said I can't hold my tounge <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
This biz ain't all fun <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Give it to ya straight, no chase <br/>
I'ma tell it like it is <br/>
Look you straight in yo face <br/>
And I'ma tell it like it is
