<i>[Criss Angel - Intro]</i><br/>
Yo it's Criss Angel.<br/>
I want to introduce you to the ultimate mind freak,<br/>
the conjurer, the prestedigitator, the supernaturalist Ludacris.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Abra cadabra, welcome to the Luda show<br/>
ladies feast your eyes on the great what it do you for<br/>
not much to hear me spit it how I live it<br/>
admit it that I'm gon kill it every chance I get it<br/>
and I'm too legit to quit it like hammer<br/>
telling my life behind bars like I've been rapping in the slammer<br/>
and other rappers slipping like they rapping on banana's<br/>
but Luda stay focused like I've been rapping for the camera's<br/>
I'm deeper than the mind of Minotaur<br/>
women say I stay harder than a rock like the rock of Gibraltar<br/>
thats why they like to blow me like they put me on a poster<br/>
and keep me by there side like they put me in a holster<br/>
I thought I told you, Luda's like magic<br/>
plus I steady get them starbucks like magic<br/>
so much money that these women won't leave<br/>
plus I got a couple other tricks up my sleeve<br/>
cos..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
it's Cris Mind freak in the back of a Roll's<br/>
I know magic pooof do away with your clothes<br/>
I know magic pooof do away with your clothes<br/>
I know magic pooof do away with your clothes<br/>
<i>[repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Voila, and for my next trick<br/>
I'm in the hood with my gang don't set trip<br/>
rep your side, throw it up like you bulimic<br/>
and if you got money like Stevie I've never seen it<br/>
broke bastards, these boys cashless<br/>
I'm on that green like Tiger Woods at the masters<br/>
I cause disaster like Doomsday<br/>
your whole life is a joke like April fools day<br/>
just kidding with cha, now here's the punchline<br/>
I eat rappers every verse thinks it's lunch time<br/>
I'm good under pressure, like when it's crunch time<br/>
I put your chick in handcuffs like one time<br/>
one rhyme will beat your whole damn album<br/>
one rhyme will make me sign on the X like Malcolm<br/>
the industry is rapping halfway and I'll house em<br/>
then skeet off with your girl, guess what, here's the outcome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Luda, got more magic than in Orlando<br/>
and plenty rounds of ammunition like Rambo<br/>
try to compete and get played like a banjo<br/>
they really need to stop it like niggas wearing sandals<br/>
take another step and get annihilated<br/>
I'm on a roll as if my pupils were dilated<br/>
thank God I made it, I'm what they call the best<br/>
I rip your fucking heart out off what they call your chest<br/>
I'm a beast with it, disturb the peace with it<br/>
give me a beat and I'll have a lyrical feast with it<br/>
then throw it in the trash and let you finish last<br/>
your life is Scrooge like the ghost of Christmas past<br/>
and I'm the Grim reaper, prepare to meet your death<br/>
you see me on the tube, now meet me in the flesh<br/>
speaking of flesh once your girl is out of the sack<br/>
you can watch me pull a fat rabbit out of my hat<br/>
because...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
