<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It was Friday night and I was feelin aight (yup)<br/>
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights<br/>
Mixin Heni with the Sprite while I’m drinkin and drivin<br/>
No police lights, no police sirens<br/>
I’m headed to the club looking for a freak<br/>
To spread a little love and spread a couple cheeks<br/>
Pull up to the spot 26’s like BAM<br/>
Eyes on me like bitch do you SEE EM?<br/>
Strolled through the front door headed to the VIP<br/>
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips<br/>
Scoping out the room and what do I SEE?<br/>
A nice round butt, an a pair a double D’s<br/>
So I creped up like shorty wus happnin<br/>
You killin that dress and I love it with a passion<br/>
Then she turned around and her face was aight<br/>
She had a gap toof and mean over bite<br/>
But I was like hmmm…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah<br/>
If I take one more drink, I’m gon end up fuckin you<br/>
Is that what you wanna do shorty?       <br/>
If I take one more drink, I’m gon end up fuckin you<br/>
You too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Woke up the next morning and all I can remember<br/>
Was taking shots and tippin the bartender<br/>
Surender to the women end up bringin me home<br/>
Cause she started lookin better every shot a Patron (yup)<br/>
I jumped up with a devilish grin<br/>
Cause tonight, damn right I might do it again<br/>
So I called up the homies (what up) let’s ride<br/>
We can hit the sports bar over on the south side<br/>
Getta couple a Coronas, couple a limes<br/>
Went up to the bar saw a couple a dimes <br/>
So I, slowly walked up and said hi<br/>
My name’s Ludacris and I’m a hell of a guy<br/>
One said I know who you are I’m your number one fan<br/>
And right now it’s too bad I gotta man<br/>
And I said I understand (I understand)<br/>
but where the hell is he at cause in a minute<br/>
if he don’t show up then maannnnn…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah<br/>
If I take one more drink, I’m gon end up fuckin you<br/>
Is that what you wanna do shorty?       <br/>
If I take one more drink, I’m gon end up fuckin you<br/>
You too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Uh huh<br/>
Aye Pain holla at em right quick man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Yeah you gon get in trouble with yo man girl<br/>
(Don’t get in trouble girl)<br/>
Talkin bout how you’re my biggest fan girl<br/>
(I know it I know it)<br/>
Now I don’t wanna do (please) but you’re gon make me do, but I<br/>
(Don’t make me do it. Don’t make me do it)<br/>
If I have more drink<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
One mo drink I’ma get cha home and I’ll split cha<br/>
Grab the camera phone and take a buncha drunk pictures<br/>
Cause Hennessey mixed with a whole buncha buda<br/>
Equals you mixed with a whole bunch Luda<br/>
And you know how far one drink could go<br/>
Start slurring my speech slowin up the flow<br/>
Hiking up ya skirts<br/>
Climing up ya shirts<br/>
It’s Mr. Late Night Luda and I like to flirt<br/>
So guess what baby girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah<br/>
If I take one more drink, I’m gon end up fuckin you<br/>
(Just one mo)<br/>
Is that what you wanna do shorty?<br/>
(That's all its gon take)       <br/>
If I take one more drink, I’m gon end up fuckin you<br/>
(Who else T-Pain)<br/>
You too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
You hear what I’m sayin<br/>
People too picky these days damn it<br/>
Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny<br/>
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminating<br/>
This has been a Luda Service Announcement<br/>
