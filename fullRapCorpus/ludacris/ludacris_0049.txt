Get the propane, rollin' things and lets blow this place uuuuuup<br/>
You already know whats uuup<br/>

But I really don't give a fuuuuuck<br/>
Cuz a brotha feels great great great great great<br/>
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake wake<br/>
All bent outta shape shape shape shape shape<br/>
So stomp on ya brake brake brake brake brake<br/>
If u token good, then all my smokas, let me see ya flames<br/>
Don't know what ya got but my bag will, put yo stuff, ta shame<br/>
All tha different kinds of otha flavors, they don't mean a thing<br/>
You cant compare it don't stare cuz I got the ultimate Mary Jane<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Get ya lighters roll that sticky, lets get higher (lets get higher)<br/>
Got that Blueberry Yum Yum And its that fire<br/>

Got that Blueberry Yum Yum And its that fire
