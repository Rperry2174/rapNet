<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It ain't no one to trust but me<br/>
And I got to make sure that I take care of my family<br/>
And it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)<br/>
<br/>
And to my niggas on the block<br/>
On the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks<br/>
You hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)<br/>
<br/>
I'm hiding out and smokin' herb<br/>
because my boss is getting on my motherfucking nerves<br/>
But I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)<br/>
<br/>
See rappin' is my only way<br/>
My mama told me just to save it for another day<br/>
But I got to make it cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Man, I can hear that wind blowing<br/>
You say it don't get cold in CP<br/>
Well niggas it's been snowing<br/>
Even though some might disagree<br/>
When business is still slowing<br/>
Even if we subject to change<br/>
Come up out them diamonds and rings<br/>
Even all them dollars and change<br/>
Nigga we home-grown<br/>
And to those that couldn't take the pressure<br/>
Nigga they long gone<br/>
Skeet 25 lighters on dressers<br/>
Or you'll get zoned on<br/>
They be puttin' them bodies in bags<br/>
They be cuttin' them bodies on slabs<br/>
Then go to somebody and brag<br/>
Got to keep a straight face<br/>
Better keep inside with your know<br/>
Got to find a safe place<br/>
Better stay in silence or go<br/>
Or end up a waste case<br/>
Pick figure it's more stuff to do<br/>
Pick nigger it's more folks than you<br/>
Pick never come close to a clue<br/>
I put my life on it<br/>
Want to disrespect give me your neck<br/>
And I'll put a knife on it<br/>
Some say it's slippery when wet<br/>
But my Roll got ice on it<br/>
It's all about supply and demand<br/>
It's all about me buying some land<br/>
You folks just don't understand<br/>
That uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Man, I see the clouds coming<br/>
Y'all see a man on the moon walking<br/>
I see a crowd running<br/>
and the APD steadily talking<br/>
'Cause we done found something<br/>
And it's not as good as it seems<br/>
Oh I wish I could get some cream<br/>
And get up out of the hood with some dreams<br/>
I'm peepin' hard crimes<br/>
See the system's fucked up<br/>
And they givin' out some hard times<br/>
Heard one of these ???<br/>
And my people snortin' hard lines<br/>
Locked up and they didn't do a thang<br/>
Locked up because of the pressure and pain<br/>
Locked up because they wouldn't do the same<br/>
And I see the case close<br/>
I can't ask no questions, and it's over<br/>
'Cause they say so<br/>
I ain't learned no lessons, but these snitches<br/>
Better lay low<br/>
Or we gonna be chopping some heads<br/>
And we gonna be rocking some beds<br/>
And we gonna be dropping some eggs<br/>
We walk a long road<br/>
Trying to find the essence of self<br/>
But I picked the wrong clothes<br/>
'Do rag with a gat under my belt<br/>
'Cause life's throwing strong blows<br/>
But I keep a little hope and some dreams<br/>
And I try to stay focused and clean<br/>
But I got a little dope and some green<br/>
'Cause uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I can see them shamed faces<br/>
Man, y'all look at me like y'all grew up<br/>
In the same places<br/>
Scams and dirty work came up on<br/>
A day to day basis<br/>
Now they got to re-up and re-bag<br/>
And they got to re-up and re-slab<br/>
Then they got to be up and be bad<br/>
This game'll NEVER end<br/>
Excuse my French, but Goddammit<br/>
I got some clever friends<br/>
They might get set back by some wench<br/>
But that bitch'll never win<br/>
It's all about the way of the world<br/>
It's all about the way of them girls<br/>
It's all about them diamonds and pearls<br/>
We waiting too long<br/>
But the DEC and Southwest Atlanta<br/>
Is too strong<br/>
We might bring that soap out and wash up<br/>
And throw them suits on<br/>
Coming in the court with some pride<br/>
'Cause we ain't got nothing to hide<br/>
Just didn't know what laws to abide<br/>
I play the cards dealt<br/>
And I bought a full house and I watched<br/>
The woman's heart melt<br/>
See my mama's cooled out and she's crying<br/>
'Cause it's heart-felt<br/>
It's all about supply and demand<br/>
It's all about me buying some land<br/>
You folks just don't understand<br/>
That uh<br/>
<br/>
