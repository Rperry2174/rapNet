<i>[Chorus - repeat 2x]</i><br/>
They wanna know why I hit like that, spit like that, <br/>
shit like that, maybe because I get like that, <br/>
kick like that, rip like that<br/>
They wanna know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, <br/>
climb like that, cuz the world is mine like that <br/>
(yours like that) mine like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
You can get your whole crews, even niggas that owe you<br/>
They ain't paid you shit you can drink some cold brew <br/>
and throw on them old shoes and jump in the whip<br/>
you can come and find us, be right behind us and insert the clip<br/>
You hear something that went "clack" "clack" "clack"<br/>
Somebody went down but it wasn't us<br/>
you can settle 'bout two meals get hooked up with a good deal<br/>
Start stackin' dough you can ride your mobile<br/>
Get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes<br/>
Tou can even start eatin' good and smokin' good <br/>
but you pressin' your luck and you say wha' <br/>
Somebody went bankrupt shiit but it wasn't us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
You can go to the drawing board just start from stratch<br/>
All over again clean<br/>
or you can tell a bunch of officers that I'm the one to catch <br/>
But my niggas is the police<br/>
you can try to blame me or even try to frame me but I'll make bail now <br/>
somebody goin' to jail shit but it wasn't us<br/>
You do track after track, and walls get plaque after plaque<br/>
CD's on rack after rack no moe selling sac' after sac'<br/>
You could've had that good life, good kids and a good wife<br/>
It was yours to earn but the records stores gettin' returns<br/>
shiit but it wasn't us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
You could be <br/>
goin on worldwide tours and see your face on every magezine<br/>
or you can flip to channel after channel <br/>
and see that ass on the TV screen<br/>
You can pay for expensive videos <br/>
and have whole lot of big bootie hoes<br/>
but when the shit start comin to a close <br/>
shiiit but it wasn't us<br/>
You can use your back-up plan, even call him your back-up man<br/>
and start think'in quick<br/>
You can call on your back-up hoes, even call the back-up pros <br/>
and tell 'em to suck a dick<br/>
and you tell just to get deez<br/>
and you tell just to pay the fees<br/>
and to pay their dues, and they catchin those STD's<br/>
Shiit but it wasn't us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (repeat 2x)]</i>
