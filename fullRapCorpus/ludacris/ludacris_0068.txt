<i>[Intro - R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Whoo... Kel... Chris...<br/>
And clubbin on some smooth shhh...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Verse - Ludacris]</i><br/>
Ludacris can't hide or deny that I wanna get you down to them Vickie Seeecretsss<br/>
and your body I won't misguide mistreat or misleeeeead it<br/>
Hate it up, love it, they can't cut it, so strut it<br/>
Number one shaker, like Vick's vapor I wanna fuckin ruuuuuub it<br/>
Louisville slug it hit em with a right left, its goooooone<br/>
tell every last one of ya girls how good it was and its gone be onnnnnn<br/>
Soul Train, wood grain, from meeeee<br/>
no pain, no gain, its so plain to seee<br/>
they be like "I've been feelin kind of stressed can you blow my back out?"<br/>
and I'm like "Yea but don't trip if I happen to yank a track out"<br/>
when I get done its smooth sailin once I pull that 'Lac out<br/>
next destination I move forward like Jerry Stackhouse<br/>
And 1, have fun, when you chillin with Ludi<br/>
Slow grind and slow jams while I'm feelin yo booty<br/>
we'll hold hand and hold times when I'm up in that coochie<br/>
you so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Got you feelin woozy baby (baby)<br/>
And thats hows it gonna be when I take you from the club to the crib<br/>
on dubs and I get you in the bed with meeee (in the bed with me)<br/>
your so pretty, and so sweaty and so sexy and so ready<br/>
girl I'm surprised you this nastyyy<br/>
but its cool cuz I always wanted to go down on a girl that reminds me of me<br/>
so get upstairs, get yo clothes off and get them sexy legs legs in a 'V' (yup)<br/>
your vision blurry as if you were seeing two of me (two of me)<br/>
you so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse]</i><br/>
Will YOU, make me feel like I just hit the lotto<br/>
other girls I give 'em a shoulder colder than Chicago<br/>
But in ya center I heat it up in the Mourning like Alonzo<br/>
and I'd get it, I'd bit it, I'd split it, I'd hit it up in a Tahoe<br/>
Bravo, make make make it clap I'd break break break ya back<br/>
then tuck tuck tuck you in so you can take take take a nap<br/>
then back to makin dividends I'm in the wind<br/>
somewhere hot, I stay on islands longer than Gulligan<br/>
sippin on a pina colada, little mama I'mma make ya holla<br/>
how does it sounds when you makin love on a Million dollars<br/>
I can only imagine lets make it real baby<br/>
like D'Angelo "How does it feel" baby<br/>
I know I talk a lot shit but I can back it up (up up)<br/>
Like BBD flip it, rub it down, smack it up (up up)<br/>
you so bad when you call me for duty<br/>
you so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse]</i><br/>
Don't get caught up in the gossip, them chicks is jockin girl<br/>
they just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rockin ya world<br/>
hey girl, hey friend, how you doing, where you been<br/>
enough of that talkin, lets begin, break it in<br/>
shake and spin, take it in, say amen<br/>
then I'll make you say goodness graciouuuus<br/>
look me in the eye and make them nasty faaaaaaaces<br/>
I'm so glad that your body's so juicyyyyy<br/>
you so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly ad libs]</i><br/>
Giiiirl, said your body is what I want (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)<br/>
I'll be making scream and mooooan (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)<br/>
Girl lets get on up out this club (wooooozy wooooozy wooooozy)<br/>
Oooh get you to my hoooome
