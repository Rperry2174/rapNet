They say "Luda, would you rather have the money or the fame?" and I steady try to tell 'em that it all just depends<br/>
Cause every time I make a little more money I seem to be losin' more of my friends<br/>
So I'd give it all up to repeat life over and they'd say "Dude is a fool"<br/>
I can't trust another motherfucker livin' in this world and this really got me losin' my cool<br/>
What would you'd do if you were in my situation and the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up?<br/>
You drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle and the Conjure would have you fucked up<br/>
So I'm lookin' for love in all the wrong places, pop pills, drink liquor by the cases<br/>
Get high, make a woman get low, in the strip club lookin' for familiar faces<br/>
People know me on a first name basis but all they ever really want's my cash<br/>
"Let me borrow just a couple hundred dollars and you know that I'm a pay you back", my ass<br/>
This world so superficial, this world done lost my trust<br/>
They say "Ludacris, you changin'" but I really don't give a FUCK!<br/>
What the hell am I suppose to think? What the hell am I suppose to do?<br/>
I'm hearin' that the Devil's in disguise and I'm hearin' that the nigga look just like you<br/>
They know I walk throw the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I don't go astray<br/>
And I get down on my knees and pray and I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Cee-Lo Green (Ludacris):]</i><br/>
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away<br/>
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away<br/>
Wish my problems would go away, away, away<br/>
<br/>
Doc say I need to change my diet, cause I really not eatin' right<br/>
Mama said I need some peace and quite, cause I'm really not sleepin' right<br/>
What's the use of havin' all the money and the power in the world if I can't abuse it?<br/>
Seems like the, only thing that's, keepin' me together is my music<br/>
If it wasn't for that I think I would lose it; if it wasn't for that I would go crazy<br/>
When nobody went good on they word and the industry'd make you feel like FUCK you pay me<br/>
Cause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me<br/>
that still lookin' for a hand out 'til you found out that there ain't shit ya handed me<br/>
Hah, still mad at me? But I'm tryin' to be the man I plan to be<br/>
But can't do it if you callin' me for dumb shit, thinkin' I'm innocent, I'ma plea insanity (ohh!)<br/>
Too many distractions, and it feels like everyday<br/>
So I get down on my knees and pray and I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I finally made it to the top of the CEO position<br/>
But when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions<br/>
So the weed keep me at peace and I think I need an intervention<br/>
Who the fuck put me in charge of makin' all of these decisions?<br/>
My position got me stressin' like it never did before<br/>
Not to mention my best friend drowned and Death was knockin' at his door<br/>
And it seems like someone in my family is passin' away like everyday<br/>
So I just look up to the sky and get on my knees and pray and I SAY!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
