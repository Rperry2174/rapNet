DRAH! 2 Fast...<br/>
DRAH! 2 Furious...<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
AHH, you just came home from doin a bid<br/>
Tell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib<br/>
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes<br/>
Tell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues<br/>
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Talkin about gats, traps, cops and robbers<br/>
It's 9-1-1, PLEASE CALL THE DOCTOR<br/>
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs<br/>
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon split ya wigs<br/>
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries<br/>
You about to catch a cold, STAY THE FUCK AROUND FROM  ME<br/>
Ya peeps talkin 'bout what kinda shits he on<br/>
You disappear like "POOF, BITCH BE GONE"<br/>
You think twelve gon catch me, GIMMIE A BREAK<br/>
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate<br/>
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years<br/>
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears<br/>
I got suede on my roof. wood grain on the dash<br/>
Sheep skin on the rug, +Golden Grain+ on the stash<br/>
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride<br/>
We go FRONT, BACK AND SIDE TO SIDE, WHAT<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink<br/>
Tell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank<br/>
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
If you got late bills and you lost your job<br/>
Tell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob<br/>
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Let's take it to the streets cuz I'm ready to cruise<br/>
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes<br/>
And the people just stare so I LOVE TO PARK IT<br/>
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment<br/>
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the GRILLE<br/>
TV in the middle of my STEERING WHEEL<br/>
It's my car's birthday so we BLOWIN THEM CANDLES<br/>
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle<br/>
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep<br/>
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat<br/>
and when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection<br/>
Cuz the women love the paint and they can see their reflection<br/>
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard<br/>
Because my side mirrors flap like a FUCKIN BIRD<br/>
And the fools, we gon CLOCK ONE and we'll POP ONE<br/>
Cuz my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You just got hustled for a wad of cash<br/>
Man whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash<br/>
Say whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth<br/>
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
If anybody talk bad about the Dirty South<br/>
Tell me what I'M gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open<br/>
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking<br/>
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is TIPSY<br/>
Off the off ramp doin about a hundred and fifty<br/>
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill<br/>
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield<br/>
Got the whole crew ridin and we startin SHIT<br/>
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit<br/>
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout<br/>
Plus your new name is Fire cuz we stomped you out<br/>
and yeah, we blow trees and bees,  that's fantastic<br/>
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic<br/>
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart<br/>
You'll be like lil John Q and get a +Change of Heart+<br/>
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams<br/>
I'M ABOUT TO BLOW THIS WHOLE SHIT UP TO SMITHEREENS<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims<br/>
Tell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
MAN, THAT AIN'T STICKY, THAT'S JUST STICKS AND STEMS<br/>
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed<br/>
Ladies whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
If the bottles all gone and your eyes are red<br/>
BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
2 Fast, 2 Furious...<br/>
2 Fast....ACT A FOOL<br/>
2 Fast, 2 Furious...<br/>
2 Fast....ACT A FOOL
