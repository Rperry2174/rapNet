<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I do it all night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I do it <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Do it<br/>
All night I make'em say<br/>
Oh <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Gimme some more<br/>
I do it all night<br/>
<br/>
My whip is all white<br/>
I don't have a couple drinks &amp; I got a 'lil buzz so I'm feelin<br/>
<br/>
Alright<br/>
But the night is just getting started<br/>
Haters get disregarded<br/>
Roll up them sweet creep creep<br/>
Let's hit this street and get retarded<br/>
I pop a bunch of bottles<br/>
My bitch would be poppin' too<br/>
Keep talkin out your face,<br/>
She might be poppin you<br/>
She might be pop blockin' droppin down to the floor with it<br/>
Meanwhile all my dogs chasing paper thats right we go get it<br/>
So get it right<br/>
Kill the lights<br/>
I'm feelin' like I might just pop a pill tonight<br/>
'Cause the feelin's right<br/>
Pass me a Miller Light<br/>
Shen grab that girl with that Coke bottle shape<br/>
She's my type<br/>
I take her home and do the do<br/>
I know the Kamasutra think what I do to you<br/>
Stick to you like superglue maybe even like a buble gum<br/>
Don't sleep woman no matter how many times I come<br/>
<br/>
I do it all night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I do it <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Do it<br/>
All night I make'em say<br/>
Oh <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Gimme some more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawnna]</i><br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I do it all night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I do it <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Do it<br/>
All night I make'em cash<br/>
Oh <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Gimme some more<br/>
<br/>
I do it all night<br/>
And I ride'em long pads<br/>
Maybe little crib could ask I'm gonna ask his shortie what that mouth<br/>
<br/>
Had<br/>
Tell me if he's out of sight<br/>
Tell me if he's slow and long<br/>
Maybe ladies do give his turn get bub maybe you're wrong<br/>
But I'm really gonna show you right<br/>
Tell me where you wanna go tonight<br/>
Anywhere anyplace I can see in your face you are the prototype<br/>
Tellin'em like I'm so so hot<br/>
So so feelin' like I'm so so right<br/>
Please tell me why the jokes on fire I can't stop zoning &amp; I don't<br/>
<br/>
Know why<br/>
Beep Beep<br/>
Get about my land<br/>
Ya hoes can't do it like me<br/>
If ya thinkin I'm 'bout the game<br/>
Take a look at my U.N.I.T<br/>
This is why I'm black on deck but don't get it twisted but strap on<br/>
<br/>
Deck<br/>
The mad on deck the pack on deck<br/>
And down there they keep a rack on deck<br/>
And there's no chairs there's no we there's no hoover &amp; there's no me<br/>
There's they would dem mass MC and there's messin'dem caddie and<br/>
<br/>
There's on three<br/>
No matter they say I'm gettin my break<br/>
Gettin' my paper<br/>
Get my cheque<br/>
But anybody wanna try to ass up<br/>
And gettin some heat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
How many woman can I feed up in my caddillac<br/>
So how I can see feelin' like I got cataract<br/>
Some in the middle with ice say I get drunk<br/>
And don't know how to act<br/>
I don't know how to act<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawnna]</i><br/>
He don't know how to act<br/>
And I don't know how to stop<br/>
And I don't know how to quit<br/>
Blowin' on in the trouble zone<br/>
Now we need another field<br/>
And I mean up out my man<br/>
Now I mean up out my body<br/>
So have do this all night<br/>
'Cause you're comin' with me shorty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
