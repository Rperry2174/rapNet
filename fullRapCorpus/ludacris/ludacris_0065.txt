<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Voice]</i><br/>
Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Satisfaction<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Voice]</i><br/>
Yeah, blow me a shotgun<br/>
B-b-blow me a shotgun<br/>
B-b-blow me a shotgun<br/>
It gives me (satisfaction)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Can you handle it<br/>
808 bang in the back with the woofer like boom boom boom boom<br/>
With my foot on the pedal and my hand on my strap<br/>
Got the engine like vroom vroom vroom vroom<br/>
What's up, you ain't never heard a nigga rap like-like this before<br/>
I got an addictive flow that'll give you (satisfaction)<br/>
I'ma make you satisfied, even if it kills me<br/>
Even if it takes the slower minds, a little bit of time to feel me<br/>
Recollect the 15 million I sold, or the 30 times I went gold<br/>
And if you take 2 puffs of this dro, it'll give you (satisfaction)<br/>
I've sold the most and noone's close, but I'm not meaning to brag<br/>
It's different strokes for different folks, like Angelina and Brad<br/>
Some keep the heat in the stash, put 30 keys in their Jag<br/>
And if cops ain't peepin your tag then you're gonna feel some (satisfaction)<br/>
Pumpin' out albums like Reverend Run is pumpin out children, here's another one<br/>
So catch me on more 24's than Kiefer Sutherland<br/>
I'm bound to be the greatest, I'm determined to win<br/>
Until then I can't get no (satisfaction)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Smoke]</i><br/>
I'm the one that went to the gunfight with a knife, and won<br/>
Left with his pistol and left him dead, the guy he tried to run<br/>
Just because my verse 2nd don't mean I am not the one<br/>
When I'm done I'm guaranteed to give you (satisfaction)<br/>
I might not be the best in the world, but the best the world ever seen<br/>
I'm all been in Georgia's daughter Conde ding-a-ling king<br/>
And when I'm digging deep in the spleen, I'ma make the cream and she scream<br/>
Baby get me hard like a Snickers bar I give her (satisfaction)<br/>
Yessir there ain't not other way so motherfuck what you say<br/>
Y'all had this spot, we took you off the top like a toupee<br/>
Them coke's been kick and pushed in this fiasco like Lupe<br/>
Back that ass up like Juve, cause the south we givin them (satisfaction)<br/>
Ever since I signed with Luda and them, my chances of losing are slim<br/>
Y'all talk that smack but copycat and do a movie like him<br/>
Yessir my mob got that goodie, as if my group had a kid<br/>
We gonna continue to give them a double dose of (satisfaction)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Shawn Jay]</i><br/>
Yea Fleetwood drop the bomb, when I rhyme it's TNT<br/>
That's why my money long as the line at the DMV<br/>
When they askin who was that that was snappin I'm that answer dude<br/>
Like Snickers bring no nuts no (satisfaction)<br/>
I hustle and flow, I done been by my cheese since I was knee high<br/>
Weed what you need, hit me I'ma drop off peaches like I'm T.I.<br/>
Earvin Johnson gimme that rock and magic cap of Shawn Jay<br/>
Dope sold money for (satisfaction)<br/>
I been the nigga they can't fuck with, hot but the flow cold<br/>
Flip rocks by the boatload O.G. no see see me get tipped off getcha no dough<br/>
Zip-loc full of dro tow big glocks on the hip cocked try to play the big shots<br/>
Get popped with the four four<br/>
Don't be the reason they mopped in the floor for payin me, that (satisfaction)<br/>
Fool for a dollar let me get that pop, man I need this cream<br/>
Where my cake give me my candles, I got sweet sixteen<br/>
Now the kid with the cocaine flow got DTP on his necklace<br/>
Now Luda tell them what you think about your invest (satisfacton)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i>
