If you live for something<br/>
You're not<br/>
Alone, my friend<br/>
So fill up your cup and<br/>
Lift your lighter<br/>
And toast to life<br/>
<br/>
Luda!<br/>
They say what don't kill me<br/>
Can make me stronger<br/>
So two drinks a night<br/>
Should help me live longer<br/>
I blow some smoke<br/>
Just to give my lungs a test<br/>
Cause why tip-toe through life<br/>
To arrive safely at death<br/>
I'm on a journey<br/>
Yeah, I'm on a roll<br/>
Sometimes gotta close my eyes<br/>
Just to open my soul<br/>
And tonight is the night<br/>
I gotta feeling that I'm about to act a fool<br/>
So if you go fix some drinks<br/>
Me and Usher are about to break some rules<br/>
<br/>
That's somewhere to go<br/>
But the world is moving slow<br/>
I was born for the fast life<br/>
I go for broke<br/>
A lesson I can't afford<br/>
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beat break]</i><br/>
<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
If I got one life to live<br/>
I'm a party 'til I'm dead<br/>
What the hell is a life worth living<br/>
If it's not on the edge<br/>
Tryna keep my balance I'm twisted<br/>
So just in case I fall<br/>
Written on my tombstone should say<br/>
Women, weed and alcohol<br/>
<br/>
That's somewhere to go<br/>
But the world is moving slow<br/>
I was born for the fast life<br/>
I go for broke<br/>
A lesson I can't afford<br/>
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beat break]</i><br/>
<br/>
If you live for something<br/>
You're not<br/>
Alone, my friend<br/>
So fill up your cup and<br/>
Lift your lighters<br/>
And toast to life<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm stuck in this moment<br/>
Freeze the hands of time<br/>
Cause I feel inner peace<br/>
When I'm outta my mind<br/>
And you can call me crazy<br/>
But I like to roll the dice<br/>
So I'm willing to bet that I'm a be crazy<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of my life
