<i>[Floyd Mayweather speaks]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Back up on dat ass,<br/>
Back to put rappers on one knee like they bout to run 100 meter dash,<br/>
Bow down to greatness, before I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers,<br/>
Covered all my bases, straight, no chasers,<br/>
Diamonds on my chain look like my neck's full of glacers,<br/>
Titanic flow, Titanic dough, women on my nuts like "Where da Titanic go?"<br/>
I been scourin' da earth, makin' my fans catch da holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church,<br/>
And the fat lady singin', it's ova for you rappers,<br/>
Can't none of ya'll bust your just sacs full of semen,<br/>
And I got da women screamin', and they could catch my balls on any given sunday like my name's Willy Beaman,<br/>
Or LL Cool, so if ya boyfriend thinks your loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool,<br/>
Got jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist<br/>
Iconic status and his name is Ludacris,<br/>
Bitch please, you messin with some real O.G's,<br/>
With million dolla whips dat I ship from overseas,<br/>
Got a pocket full of G'z, and the inconvenient truth is that the ozone is back cause I been smokin' all da trees,<br/>
The globe is warmin' up when we fire up the blunt,<br/>
And put it in the air like Evil Knievel stunts,<br/>
Wat you want from me? I got pistols for da haters,<br/>
Ya fam will be in black like the playin' for da Raiders,<br/>
And ya music isn't favored, and DJ's they neva bring it back like when you go and borrow somethin' from ya neighbor,<br/>
Like a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt,<br/>
The name of my car insurance is YO fuckIN FAULT,<br/>
And if you sittin on chrome, I'll call up my boys and have you stripped of ya medals like Marion Jones, nigga...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Floyd Mayweather speaks]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Back up on da scene, back to put a nail in these rappers' coffins I got the hammer in my jeans,<br/>
Call me Mr.Fixit, barrel hotter than a fresh batch of home-made buttermilk biscuits,<br/>
A-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket,<br/>
Luda leaves intruders stretched out like Gymnastics,<br/>
And acrobatics I'm superstar status, the mouth of the South like gangsta grillz you bastard,<br/>
The international traveler, and I may not be much to you but I'm the sh*t out in Africa,<br/>
So put ya fist up, even the statue of liberty lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up,<br/>
You can't compete with me, I got 'em stuck like I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me,<br/>
And then I broke free, I'll let 'em loose when Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free,<br/>
I'm the baddest mother shut it like Shaft was, leavin' rappers with headaches like bad drugs,<br/>
They shoulda warned ya, you got defeated by the heat but, eh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya,<br/>
So Cater coroner, I'll show up to yo funeral with some gators like I'm fresh outta Florida,<br/>
Call me the swamp thing, ya'll headed in the wrong direction like you hit the subway and caught the wrong train,<br/>
So don't f**k with it, I'm sendin' lyrical bullets right at ya dome f**k niggaz betta duck with it,<br/>
Or else you stuck with it,<br/>
You'll get stalked so bad you'll leava da scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it,<br/>
But not in Cashville, you lost yo feelin' like comin down off X chasin' effects of yo last pill,<br/>
You fuckin Daffy Dill, You's a Daffy Duck,<br/>
And I'm the undefeated champ, ya'll niggas suck!
