<i>[Chorus - Jason Aldean:]</i><br/>
When all your love is lost<br/>
And burning bridges can't be crossed<br/>
Lord, won't you let me know?<br/>
Or give me one more reason to go?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I done took all I could take from you<br/>
Need a little bit more than a break from you<br/>
Matter of fact - FUCK you, don't need you in my life (no)<br/>
You done did so much wrong I hope you get right<br/>
But not at my expense, I did all I could do<br/>
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool (nah)<br/>
When I did everything in my power to help and please you<br/>
But I don't know you no more - FUCK it, I caught amnesia! (woo!)<br/>
Too many emotions I try to bury<br/>
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm tryin' to carry (yeah)<br/>
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama<br/>
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma<br/>
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together<br/>
Forget about the past, now's a better time than NEVER<br/>
Matter of fact, it's time to start makin' better decisions<br/>
So put your fires out and stop burnin' Chris' bridges (woo!)<br/>
Hah, you little bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters<br/>
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas<br/>
In my Ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship<br/>
Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit<br/>
Smilin' in my face when I'm around y'all<br/>
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my downfall (Lord)<br/>
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?<br/>
My bitches always look better? You fail at business endeavours?<br/>
Or that people thought you were clever but now they know you STUPID?<br/>
And misery loves company now that you're goin' through it? (yeah)<br/>
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis<br/>
So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?<br/>
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon<br/>
That's why you find me in the club every once in a blue moon<br/>
So while you contemplate makin' your first million<br/>
I'll be somewhere contemplatin' on makin' my first BILLION<br/>
Hah, and then trillion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the biggest mistake we make as individuals (what's that?)<br/>
is thinkin' everyone lives by the same principles (okay)<br/>
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals (nope)<br/>
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle (woo!)<br/>
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout (nah)<br/>
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out<br/>
Niggas is fightin' inside, we can't just walk 'em out (they fightin'!)<br/>
These bridges burnin' so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out<br/>
Ugh, as if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
