Everybody wants the fortune and fame<br/>
The more things change, the more they stay the same<br/>
This industry is like a crap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
This industry is like a crap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
<br/>
Where do I begin<br/>
Well, the industry shady not everybody is your friend<br/>
I had to learn that shit the hard way<br/>
In and out bogus contracts since before I was rapping in the hallway<br/>
Everyone out for money, executives out for blood<br/>
If you don't keep the music current then labels'll pull the plug (Get it)<br/>
Hard to admit when shit don't go the way you plan<br/>
While everybody's on Instagram just fronting like life is brand<br/>
Take it back to one of my first tours<br/>
Fuckin' everything movin' thinkin' groupies will never do nothing back to us<br/>
Kick 'em out the hotel swearing I hit my finer things<br/>
Lost a bunch of jewelry from a Rolex to a diamond chain (Bitch)<br/>
How in the hell did I get caught slippin'<br/>
Meanwhile on all my records, nigga talkin' bout he pimpin'<br/>
Maybe i exaggerated a lil bit<br/>
You know fake it till you make it every one of us rappers gotta talk a little shit<br/>
Yeah I done smashed some video vixens and some actresses<br/>
But brand name pussy don't feel no different on my matresses<br/>
Insecure hoes with brest jobs and butt shots<br/>
Blaming on us rich niggas sponsoring shit and what not<br/>
Now guys are just as big as groupies as these women is<br/>
Till you break up and a bitch wonder where her percentage is<br/>
While these regular hoes are trying to play the trap game<br/>
And now is the time I blame it on the rap game<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wants the fortune and fame<br/>
The more things change, the more they stay the same<br/>
This industry is like a crap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
This industry is like a crap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
<br/>
Listen, this ain't scripted this reality<br/>
It take some drugs for us to conquer this is sanity<br/>
Thieves using our name promoting these fake appearances<br/>
Publicists overcharging taking years for these clearances<br/>
I got <i>[?]</i> some rappers said I stole their joint nigga<br/>
Spend half a million just to prove a fucking point nigga<br/>
We got the fans thinking rappers never lose<br/>
Gave a producer a hundred grand for a beat I never use (Damn)<br/>
The false stories and being misquoted in magazines<br/>
Got a nigga wanting to go and load a couple magazines<br/>
Head to your office and shoot up the whole fucking staff<br/>
Post that on your website and burn while I fucking laugh<br/>
You protesters at my concerts y'all make me sick<br/>
I thought I told y'all I would never disrespect a bitch<br/>
It's clear to see that Hip Hop's under attack man<br/>
Or is it cause that no one wants to see a rich black man<br/>
Really they want us with no money<br/>
Hungover and missing flights and cutting our show money<br/>
Hip Hop cops still looking and trying to catch us slippin'<br/>
And put us in a position to make some real life decisions (Hmmm)<br/>
Or do we just be doing dumb shit<br/>
Emptying out these gun clips and always on the run shit<br/>
Lifestyles of us entertaining hood niggas<br/>
If it's bad to be a rapper what's good nigga<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wants the fortune and fame<br/>
The more things change, the more they stay the same<br/>
This industry is like a crap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game<br/>
This industry is like a crap game<br/>
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
