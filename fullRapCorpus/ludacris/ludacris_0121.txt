<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
Mustard on the beat, ho<br/>
Luda!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Rollin down the highway<br/>
Nothing for me to do but smoke, it's habitual Friday<br/>
Break it down, spread it out, nigga roll up<br/>
And let's see what they about, call them hoes up<br/>
Ludacris, man these bitches want my last name<br/>
Sippin slow but I'm drivin all in the fast lane<br/>
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch<br/>
And hoodie yappin if you never wanna do shit<br/>
I'm all about it, get yo mind right<br/>
Been making money since before I was in the lime light<br/>
Grind like – bitch, wussup!<br/>
Top down but I feel like getting fucked up<br/>
I get high but the bass low<br/>
A real nigga, watch a woman wanna shake fo<br/>
When you shake it for a baller better shake it right<br/>
'Cause it's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up<br/>
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up<br/>
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell<br/>
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell<br/>
(It's about to be a hell of a night)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Club packed and one nigga and they drink on<br/>
Just lookin for a reason to get they freak on<br/>
Catch me up in the VIP and it's roaped off<br/>
To keep raggedy ass hoes off<br/>
Then I'm bout to have a smoke off<br/>
Rich nigga but I'm tryna get broke up<br/>
Turn it up as I make the beat break down<br/>
Ass up, face down<br/>
Yea, that's still the best way to get it<br/>
Down the middle, that's the best way to split it<br/>
I'm talkin money, disturbin the peace, racked up<br/>
One too many American black cards stacked up<br/>
Backed up and it's on<br/>
Don't get beat down til it's on<br/>
I feel these hatin ass niggas wanna fire<br/>
What?<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up<br/>
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up<br/>
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell<br/>
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell<br/>
(It's about to be a hell of a night)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I'm always looking for trouble to get into<br/>
Take your girlfriend's friends, bring friends too<br/>
What you drinkin? I got it all, pour it all up<br/>
So stay, my partners – they throw it all up<br/>
I don't want a ménage so bitch let go<br/>
I'm tryna get 3 women, play connect 4<br/>
Congratulations, you made it into the top 5<br/>
Your mouth help me, push the Bentley into Mach 5<br/>
She got me speedin in the red zone<br/>
Always Luda like they callin this the head zone<br/>
Hands up, I bread win and the bread's up<br/>
So make a peace sign, baby put yo legs up<br/>
Is it really that good to ya?<br/>
Do you like it when a nigga talk hood to ya?<br/>
Do you like a little scratch, a little bite?<br/>
Well, It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
It's about to be a hell of a night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up<br/>
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up<br/>
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell<br/>
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell<br/>
(It's about to be a hell of a night)
