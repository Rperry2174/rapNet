<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everybody with me drunk as fuck<br/>
Break it down and roll it up<br/>
Everybody with me drunk as fuck<br/>
Break it down and roll it up <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Ok, Ok, Ok now everybody with me drunk as fuck<br/>
Break it down and roll it up<br/>
Everybody got they killaz with 'em<br/>
Rep yo side and throw it up<br/>
<br/>
Po' it up and it's goin' down<br/>
Light another blunt and it's goin' round<br/>
Puff puff pass you can toast yo glass<br/>
Later we'll screw and slow it up<br/>
<br/>
If you make it fast, I can make it last<br/>
And I'm a nigga that's makin' cash<br/>
8 figures in the bank and I pull yo rank<br/>
What you thank with ya hatin' ass<br/>
<br/>
Hehehehehe, you think you fly, I know you not<br/>
Hehehehehe, you tote yo knife, I tote my glock<br/>
<br/>
Big body cadillac, women in the backseat,<br/>
Speakers steady pumpin' as I pass these losers<br/>
Yo car too small, why? cause I can't fit my women in a PT Cruiser<br/>
<br/>
Get ya cake up, get ya weight up way up to the top 'til u can't go further<br/>
These snitches is after my riches and yes I smell bloody murder<br/>
<br/>
When I cock back with a drop dat can't block dat lock dat fools betta stop dat<br/>
Otherwise you can pop back<br/>
But after dumpin a round you'll be wonderin' where the cops at<br/>
<br/>
Where the cops at? cause I'm drunk as fuck<br/>
Tell'em I'm far from sober<br/>
Cause if the po po happen to pull me over<br/>
I'm a just tell'em...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawnna:]</i><br/>
Swisha after swisha, I blow dat official<br/>
This one fo' my niggas and everybody witcha<br/>
Pop another bottle, I'm a rep chicago<br/>
With dem 22s on dat black on black gallardo, in da front door<br/>
<br/>
Gotta bottle of goose you know I'm finna get loose<br/>
Get it buck, buck holla wassup<br/>
To all my niggas in back and all my bitches in front put ya cups up<br/>
<br/>
Put ya drank in, put ya smoke in<br/>
Put ya pop in, get ya roll in<br/>
Do the OC, got me open<br/>
Big diamonds, you jokin'<br/>
<br/>
And I don't know what I'm gone do<br/>
But I'm gone so I'm thinkin' 'bout rollin' up<br/>
One to the head like a real thoroughbread<br/>
Know what I'm sayin' let me hit it<br/>
Roll it, roll it up<br/>
<br/>
And I smoke it up<br/>
Don't give a damn if I choke it up<br/>
I broke it up and I toke it up<br/>
Eyes hella red and my throat lit up<br/>
<br/>
I don't give up and I don't give in<br/>
You don't get high nigga don't get in<br/>
But won't yo friend cause he want my friend<br/>
And I been on fire since I don't know when, I don't know when<br/>
<br/>
Now errbody with me pourin' up<br/>
Errbody with me hold it up<br/>
Errbody with me know, if I say so,<br/>
It's gone be throwin' up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
