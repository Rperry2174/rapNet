<br/>
She's dangerous (alright) super bad (uh huh)<br/>
Better watch out she'll take ya cash.<br/>
She's a gold... digger <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i><br/>
Yeah, shes a money magnet, smell a dollar bill in ya clothes.<br/>
Gold digger style from her head to her toes<br/>
You here me saying no don't mess with the stress<br/>
She's out to get ya dough none more none less<br/>
Shes lookin' for a prize, man you killing me<br/>
Acting like you don't see the dollar signs in her eyes<br/>
She wants her nails done, and her hair too<br/>
Plus a diamond necklace, thats all on you<br/>
You still can't see it, yeah you a sucka<br/>
If you do it homeboy man i couldn't be it<br/>
Hypnotised by her goodlooks?<br/>
Yeah maybe, but a victim for a good crook? Nope not me!<br/>
Consider yourself worn so you can stay.<br/>
Or you can stick to my rhyme and get the heck away!<br/>
Either way, go figure, shes a gold digger.<br/>
Gettin' close as your bank row grows bigger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bobby V]</i><br/>
She's dangerous, super bad,<br/>
Better watch out she'll take ya cash.<br/>
She's a gold digger..<br/>
She's a gold digger..<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Fate]</i><br/>
You gotcha way witha beauty<br/>
A treat with a brain<br/>
When she look at you she only see "ching-ching"<br/>
Mil around your neck, mil around your arms<br/>
A championship ring, she must be a bowla hard<br/>
She turns on the leader, as soon as you need her<br/>
Once you bite the bait, you look mighty thico<br/>
When money talks she ticks like F.B.I<br/>
Ready to handcuff the right guy<br/>
Look you in the eye, and tell a boldface lie.<br/>
Scheming on the way to money yo, well ya tried<br/>
Guess its a game now, gotta watch who you trust<br/>
Like her because, its only out for your books<br/>
Ye sir, shes all about being paid<br/>
At the end of everyday its a fine new grade,<br/>
What more can i say? But the wires up front<br/>
Better watch out, she'll leave yah with insuffiant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bobby V]</i><br/>
She's so physical.<br/>
I say movie stars you better watch your back<br/>
She'll be spending up your cheque<br/>
Oh yeah. For the growin... just won't stop<br/>
Will be rotting in your eyes<br/>
<br/>
She's a...Gold digga, gold digga, gold digga yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i><br/>
She's dreaming scheming on a way to get your dough<br/>
She hit the lottery now hit the flow, you just don't know<br/>
because you got got and thats for show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Fate]</i><br/>
Oh eyah she's a superstar chick<br/>
But don't fool with her unless you got miles of risk<br/>
She's a pimpstress runnin' more game than the Olympics<br/>
to cease your assests like the I.R.S<br/>
Aha uh uh huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Repeat till fade)]</i>
