The royal penis is clean your highness<br/>
Thank you, king shit<br/>
<br/>
Yeah motherfuckers!  Welcome to the United States of America.<br/>
Time to roll out the red carpet on y'all bitch asses.<br/>
Hailin from the filthy, dirty South, where the Kings lay.<br/>
Ludacris; Disturbin' Tha Peace family.  Recognize royalty<br/>
when you hear it.  The throne has been taken, so kiss this<br/>
nigga's earring.  Luda throw some grapes on these bitches!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
These bitches throwin rose petals at my feet mayn!<br/>
They wanna spoil me, treatin me like royalty;<br/>
what I'm 'sposed to do?  It's such a sweet thang<br/>
Work that track, whip 'em like Kunta<br/>
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda<br/>
By way of A-T-L; if you disagree<br/>
don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail<br/>
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly<br/>
It's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli<br/>
Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's!  Luda's oodles of noodles<br/>
And testin me is like pitbulls put up to poodles<br/>
My rap career goes back further than yo' father hairline<br/>
It's Ludacris - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines<br/>
I'm fly, even when I get high I work cash<br/>
And even got my coats bumped up to first class<br/>
I'm boss to all employees - and I'm here to teach the principle<br/>
Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Vorhees<br/>
<br/>
Man fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man.  I'm tired of<br/>
this shit man.  Man I try to rap for the nigga, I try to get<br/>
a nigga tracks; he ain't hearin my shit.  Man for real.<br/>
Man my four-year-old son can rap better than that nigga;<br/>
man that nigga garbage.  Man I got talent too, the nigga ain't<br/>
hearin me.  Man iii-iiiis this shit on?  'Cris, c'mon 'Cris.<br/>
'Cris, f'real man.  FUCK YOU NIGGA, MAN FUCK YOU!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Fuck you too!  What you wanna do, scrawny nigga<br/>
But I got a arsenal of automatics down to twenty-twos<br/>
Know how to use 'em, fight dirty as SHIT<br/>
I throw a grenade and all-in-one bury a CLIQUE<br/>
You see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos<br/>
And comin up shorter than five Danny DeVitos<br/>
I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos<br/>
With five strippers, four wives and three amigos<br/>
I go scuba divin in Bays at Montego<br/>
I find gold links and snatch 'em like I'm Deebo<br/>
But I'm the light-skinteted version of Mandingo<br/>
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo<br/>
I used to run numbers in line they caled me BINGO<br/>
Cause I'm big, you a little star, you just twinkle<br/>
Old asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled<br/>
And I stay with more BULLETS than yo' Billboard singles<br/>
<br/>
Ho that is just too much! You just gotta give applause<br/>
he is definitely all f'real - yasee WHAT I'msayin? Ha ha I be<br/>
fuckin with him all the time, yah know what I mean? I'm sayin, I used<br/>
to just sell home herb (?) now home come through he want fiftys OF purple,<br/>
he want quarters OF purple now. I DONT KNOW HOW to trip with it<br/>
man, I just sold him a QP last week of the flava,<br/>
yaseewhatI'msayin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, can I get a little hit of that, little nigga with a bigga sack<br/>
See piece of the bigger trap look at that God be rollin on that<br/>
Where they kick it at?  And a lot of people just don't know<br/>
Shady Park you heard just don't go<br/>
Quick to flip the bird up po'-po'<br/>
Makin the way for that rodeo, that rodeo show!<br/>
Gotta hit 'em with a reload, I gotta put 'em with the people<br/>
I gotta make a nigga stop, drop, roll - oh no where the beat go?<br/>
Bring that, shit back, didn't wanna hear that, clik-clak<br/>
Tons of fun with guns<br/>
Fuck all the lil' chit-chat get back get that get that<br/>
Who knows, who goes there?  Motherfuckers it's Poppa Bear<br/>
Stop and stare; pourin out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare<br/>
I'm on, FIRE!  And you know I can't stop 'til I re-TIRE!<br/>
Oh no, we stay swoll, rollin on Vogue TIRES!<br/>
Right down the avenue, passin you rapidly stackin<br/>
In the back of the Cadillac and packin emergency action<br/>
Camera, LIGHT LIGHTS, throwin a punch and then FIGHT FIGHT<br/>
Packin a lunch and then BITE BITE, A-T-L stay TIGHT TIGHT<br/>
<br/>
I'm just tryin to save ya shorty.  I'ma let you know<br/>
it's real down heah.  When you ride down that two-eighty-five,<br/>
and you go past Kincaid, get ready to go past that Cambleton Road<br/>
fo' you get it cut free shorty just shake; cause dat where dem<br/>
real niggaz at.  I ain't lyin when you in Decatur and you flossin<br/>
down Glenwood, Candler Road or Rainbow to shake!<br/>
Cause dat where dem real niggaz at.  When you're goin down that<br/>
ol' Nat Hill and you pass dat second waffle house 'fore you get<br/>
to the rich niggaz daaang, cause dat where dem real niggaz at!<br/>
Matter of fact, just shake when ya get to Georgia nigga.
