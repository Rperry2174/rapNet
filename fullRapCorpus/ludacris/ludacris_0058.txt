Yeah.. we gon' send this one out<br/>
to e'rybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship<br/>
Let's ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you <i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> It's get out, put my pedal to the flo' and let's roll!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yesss, 7 cars, 8 cribs and ain't a damn thing changed<br/>
I'm still pumpin 10 kickers, still grippin the grain<br/>
Still candy in the paint, still ridin them thangs<br/>
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain<br/>
Until I, jump in my ride, that's my only escape<br/>
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screamin, "Gimme a break!"<br/>
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses<br/>
Don't be mad cause I can't hold my 500 horses<br/>
Lamborghinis and Porsches, Ferraris and Vipers<br/>
I'ma wipe the seats witcho' drool then rub the hood with a diaper<br/>
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank<br/>
I MEAN to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank<br/>
Go strap your seatbelts on, go put your money up<br/>
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up<br/>
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys<br/>
Time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys<br/>
We goin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yo, one of my ways of releasin tension while I'm releasin some steam<br/>
Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm makin sure the slippers is clean<br/>
The 26's is mean, shut down the block, nigga picture the fiends<br/>
My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene<br/>
The chickens just scream, whole crew ballin they sick of my team<br/>
We gettin the cream, I'm through hollerin, I'm livin my dream<br/>
I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings<br/>
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings<br/>
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide<br/>
You can keep your rules and regulations man cause we don't abide<br/>
And we lookin alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5<br/>
In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive<br/>
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side<br/>
Onlookers and turnin heads is all that's seen through his eyes<br/>
I'm breezin on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly<br/>
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side<br/>
and go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm ridin up in, GTO's, and fo'-fo'-two's<br/>
Grand Prixs, S-S's cause we so so cool<br/>
Ridin Regals or the 'llacs, we in Chevelles and Verts<br/>
Skylarks, motorcycles, ATV's with the works<br/>
Malibus and Camaros, T-Birds and Novas<br/>
Escalades, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers<br/>
H-2's and Denalis, pickup trucks with the beams<br/>
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supremes<br/>
are goin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets)
