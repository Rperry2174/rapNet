<i>[Hook - Usher:]</i><br/>
If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from me<br/>
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them<br/>
And not long <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Long days half sober nights<br/>
Unsigned performing at every open mic<br/>
God is all I needed to believe in me<br/>
Haters I tune them out they were on another frequency<br/>
My momma never winded my decision<br/>
And all the bright lights never blinded out my vision<br/>
Music was my passion and my first crush<br/>
I'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up<br/>
When I'm down music gets me worked up<br/>
Plus in all my shows it gets womans to pull they skirts up<br/>
What can I say I'm turnt up<br/>
I'm on fire these other rappers is burnt up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Yeah what an imagination<br/>
I'm a dreamer losing my concentration<br/>
Head in the clouds to trace my observations<br/>
Just connect the dots to all of the constellations<br/>
Looking for signs that's astrological<br/>
And I don't dream big my dreams are astronomical<br/>
So when critics write articles of my chronicles<br/>
I wonder if my hunger is felt and they abdominal<br/>
Hiding from life daily distraction<br/>
Where thoughs become things from the power of attration<br/>
And I'm attracted to money and beautiful woman<br/>
Ha and toasting to new beginnings, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Look its not long til the fights over<br/>
The turbulence is non stop till the flights over<br/>
So when passangers panic just stay silent<br/>
And realize its never too late to become the pilot<br/>
I fly higher take control of my destiny<br/>
The first step I needed me to invest in me<br/>
Its still an every day struggle for wealth<br/>
I'd rather struggle to working for me than working for someone else<br/>
And I'm steady tryna ease the stress<br/>
So I open up all the doors with the key to success<br/>
If it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first<br/>
Cuz I'm the master of the Ludaverse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
