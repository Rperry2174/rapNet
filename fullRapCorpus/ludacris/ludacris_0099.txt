Party Imma party til I just can't party no mo<br/>
<i>[Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
Party Imma party til I just can't party no mo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I dun had about four five six shots<br/>
yeah I'm getting wasted<br/>
red pills, blue pills yeah I'm in the matrix<br/>
two swisha, three swisha, four swisha, five<br/>
so turn my music up and tell these hoes to get live<br/>
got a pocket full of hundreds and some bottles on ice<br/>
conjure and lime got a nigga feeling nice<br/>
dessert on my hip so if you gamble roll the dice<br/>
when I let it off once, make a nigga think twice<br/>
you got more dough then homie you gon have to show me<br/>
you never say it rains like Tony Tony Tony<br/>
my Chevy's outside and it's sitting on Kobe's<br/>
and I keep the hood with me like Obi Wan Kenobe<br/>
wood grain trim, seats softer than your butt butt<br/>
make the car rattle from the speakers in my trunk<br/>
swishas burning slow and it got a nigga stuck<br/>
but don't be a fool cause the tool's on tuck tuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Tell that slow bitch to bring another round<br/>
we gon party til the suns up<br/>
ladies rub your titties and gangsta's put your guns up<br/>
money money money if you got it throw your ones up<br/>
and if they ain't got it tell em shut up you dumb fuck<br/>
my money stays in hand you could say I got a grip grip<br/>
out to scoop my chips you could say I got a dip dip<br/>
cause I talk money while these haters talk shit shit<br/>
and if they keep on talking I'ma empty out a clip clip<br/>
but I don't want no problems I'm just trying to get my game on<br/>
take a couple shots and use the alcohol to blame on<br/>
holla at some chicks then find a bitch to put my name on<br/>
then I'ma be I'ma be the one she put that thing on<br/>
I got the perfect song to make you want me want to shake shake<br/>
take her to the crib I don't take her on no date date<br/>
we all up in the club til the glass and table break break<br/>
and all they wanna know is how much more that I can take take<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Now keep the camera's flashin we about to shoot a movie<br/>
a thick chick let me sip my glass on her booty<br/>
she stuck upon my hip and she swear she ain't no groupie<br/>
while I'm stuck up on the VIP, but everything is all Gucci<br/>
so I gathered all the women and we about to take a shot<br/>
gone out my mind, who's there nigga knock knock,<br/>
don't you hear that 808 beatin down your block<br/>
keep the party going cause the party don't stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
