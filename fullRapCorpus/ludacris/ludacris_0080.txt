<i>[Intro: Ving Rhames]</i><br/>
He's a hustler, unbound by law<br/>
A self-made, millionaire<br/>
With a wreckless disregard, for the haters<br/>
Ludacris, on "Southern Gangsta"...<br/>
A true, entrepre-negro<br/>
CEO of Disturbing Tha Peace Records<br/>
He expended his empire into multiple profitable businesses<br/>
Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits<br/>
Internet sites, WeMix.com<br/>
And my favorite, MyGhetto.com<br/>
The MVP, of this rap shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER<br/>
I stay strapped like your neighborhood trap dealer<br/>
I got rifles that blow ya below ya bible belt<br/>
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)<br/>
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes<br/>
Softer than bitches washin dishes, fool what's the BUSINESS?<br/>
I'm already rich, so talk mo' figures (yup)<br/>
Spit 30 large for cigars of you hoe niggaz (oww!)<br/>
I got gangstas that'll rearrange ya whole face<br/>
And put your casket on ice, now that's a cold case (ha!)<br/>
Never forget where you come or that block'll bang you<br/>
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel<br/>
I cock and blast you, into outer space<br/>
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place<br/>
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block<br/>
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Ving Rhames]</i><br/>
He's the biggest boss, comin outta the M-I-yayo<br/>
Straight from the "Port of Miami"<br/>
To keepin it "Trilla"<br/>
Involved in many heated acts of violence<br/>
This goes deeper than rap shit<br/>
He's worth eight figures<br/>
So young niggaz, boss up<br/>
I present to you, Rick Ross, the boss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I got a letter from the government, the other day<br/>
I opened and read it, it said "We want hustlers"<br/>
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that<br/>
Got a Chevy with pictures on it from pitchin crack<br/>
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin Creole<br/>
Bitch I'm a D-boy, still slingin kilos<br/>
I got twenty cars, why exaggerate?<br/>
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks<br/>
Love the marble floors, got the Greek pillows<br/>
Frontin at awards, real street niggaz<br/>
I used to serve shake, now I serve steaks<br/>
Three squares on the road, call it 3rd Bass<br/>
Big ass face, chop you in your laugh face<br/>
Shoot his ass, aim defense is the last case<br/>
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz<br/>
You in a pool of blood, let me see you swim<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Ving Rhames]</i><br/>
Hailing from College Park, Georgia<br/>
Authorities figured they must have been some sort of mob<br/>
Or illegal organization<br/>
According to authorities, they made a quarter mil' a week<br/>
Selling {?}, they were some high-rollin hustlers<br/>
Tity Boi, and Dolla Boy<br/>
Playaz Circle, A.K.A., the Duffle Bag Boys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tity Boi (Dolla Boy)]</i><br/>
Uhh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital<br/>
It's an election year, I support struggle<br/>
(We roll like bicycles, icicle flow)<br/>
(White liquor, my nigga stay on line with the blow)<br/>
I'm on time with the flow, not a minute nor second late<br/>
Ain't no such thing as second place<br/>
(And every day I live heavyweight, you niggaz featherweight)<br/>
(Fairytale tellin niggaz really need to take a break)<br/>
And the estate got a lake for a backyard<br/>
(The pool room product put it all on my sacks card)<br/>
For real? (Yeah, for real)<br/>
I'm ill, I deal, I did, I will<br/>
(I got dogs like Cujo, me and Tity two chains ridin in a two do')<br/>
Bitches catch kudos (you know)<br/>
Yeah we move weight like sumos<br/>
And kicks it with them bitches like judo<br/>
SOUTHSIDE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Ving Rhames]</i><br/>
Playaz Circle, Rick Ross, Ludacris<br/>
This has been another episode, of "Southern Gangsta"<br/>
Thanks for tunin in, what's next for Luda?<br/>
Well, anything's possible, in the (Theater of the Mind)
