<i>[Chorus (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
Eastside, eastside nigga wha?<br/>
(Eastside, eastside nigga what?)<br/>
I'm talk bout da Westside, westside nigga wha?<br/>
(Westside, westside nigga wha?)<br/>
Northside, northside nigga wha?<br/>
(Northside, northside nigga wha?)<br/>
Southside, southside nigga wha?<br/>
(Southside, southside nigga wha?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Good luck, time to get hood stuck<br/>
Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff<br/>
Ludacris give me 20 push-ups<br/>
Last summer, got da hook up<br/>
You know what I did<br/>
Who'd eva thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids<br/>
Type of rat, sat on my ass<br/>
And fiendin' for cash<br/>
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass<br/>
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins<br/>
and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin<br/>
I love women so I'm in it to win it<br/>
In it to green<br/>
In it to get in it and get in it again<br/>
You got two booties so you whippin yo chin<br/>
And I don't blame you<br/>
I lay in da sand, ya'll lay in da snow and make angels<br/>
My ice piece dangle<br/>
make my chest look older<br/>
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder<br/>
I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier<br/>
Shady park resident and southside Rider<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Get back, time to get hood jacked<br/>
Gold chain, took dat<br/>
World of Ghetto fabolous Dopeboys and Hoodrats<br/>
Becareful what you look at<br/>
cause you lookin to long<br/>
You might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long<br/>
I'm gettin nutt while I'm singin this song<br/>
and there is enough for everybody in da party <br/>
while ya'll hittin da bong<br/>
But ya'll be hittin my schlong<br/>
you play the flute quite nicely<br/>
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty<br/>
Oh no, you suckas didn't request back up<br/>
Broads I seem to rack up<br/>
When I pull da gold acta<br/>
Get slapped up<br/>
Drove up da wall<br/>
Put it in Reverse<br/>
you can hope for the best, but expect the worst<br/>
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst<br/>
Its quite funny<br/>
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny<br/>
It seems as if thats what I need<br/>
Filthy south and Ds<br/>
Thats why I roll in from da Southside breeze<br/>
Give it to me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Your pick time to get hood sick<br/>
Hit'em wit a good lick<br/>
Clean out yo house from da couch to da toothpick<br/>
EastSide Ruthless<br/>
WestSide leave 'em clueless<br/>
my Northside mackers got dis broads actin foolish<br/>
And do this for a living<br/>
while you stuck up in yo cubicle<br/>
Nightlife runnin dis streets, it sounds beautiful<br/>
Women break a cuticle<br/>
Ballas break bread<br/>
Southside, I represent it till I'm dead<br/>
What wha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
