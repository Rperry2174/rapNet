<i>[Man coughs]</i><br/>
<i>[Man talking]</i><br/>
Ah yeah, we sending this one out<br/>
From everybody I mean to everybody from the H-Town to the A-Town<br/>
To worldwide so get your lighters, get your drink<br/>
And I tell you what I'm so fucked up, and screwed up<br/>
If anybody try to blow my high, you know what I'ma tell 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[(Man) Ludacris]</i><br/>
(Fuck you!) Fuck you!<br/>
(Fuck you!) Fuck you!<br/>
(Fuck you!) Fuck you!<br/>
(Fuck you!) Fuck you!<br/>
(I'm screwed up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I feel better than I've ever felt before, Ah!<br/>
Intoxicated but maintaining self-control, Ah!<br/>
I took a swig, I had a jug, chug-a-log, I'm loud and clear<br/>
I had some bud, I lit it up, and then I made it disappear<br/>
'Cause my magic tricks, are so fabulous<br/>
This shit's hazardous, got amateurs smoking canibus<br/>
If you mad at this, damn it then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Flip]</i><br/>
I made a, call to my dog, time to split the blunt and break it up<br/>
Three-wheel motion, purple potion, I gotta shake it up<br/>
I tried to kick the habit, but it keep calling me<br/>
Abracadabra, here's a magic trick, I smoked up all the weed<br/>
Zig-Zag's and golden wraps got my mind gone<br/>
Drugs don't affect my work, I still get my grind on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm leaning like the Tower of Pisa, the syrup squeezer<br/>
Come close to my stash, and get treated as if I'm Ebeneezer<br/>
I'm throwed, blowed, matter-of-fact let's call this the thrower potion<br/>
I'm screwed up, so no wonder things are in slower motion<br/>
I gots to have it,can't kick the habit, I've tried to shake it<br/>
The drug experiment stage if you mistake then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Flip]</i><br/>
I'm from Screwed Up Texas, we drive reckless, and then we peel off<br/>
You ain't had shit until you smoke Sweet Tooth and Jack Frost<br/>
Hit it twice but don't cough, you gotta take it man<br/>
If it's a record for smoking I'm 'bout to break it man<br/>
Me and Luda puffing budda, we in a black Cougar<br/>
On Zap Judas, you try to jack us we grab rugers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
How can I say it plain?<br/>
That I'm off that Mary Jane<br/>
And if it's true what they say<br/>
Then I don't know how many cells is left in my fucking brain<br/>
But I'ma keep on writing and lighting<br/>
Minds of these hungry rappers<br/>
And tell the hood that I've hired niggers and fired crackers<br/>
On the Fourth of July, opens your eyes I'm joking stupid<br/>
I love all races but if you hating my music then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Flip]</i><br/>
I love my<br/>
Occupation we never have to take a piss test<br/>
Fuck a 9 to 5 'cause I'm always getting rest<br/>
I wake to breakfest and head<br/>
You wake up to breakfast in bed<br/>
Should I drive my H2?  Hmmm?<br/>
I'ma take the Lexus instead<br/>
Pimping ain't dead but I'll leave you niggaz<br/>
Dead from all this pimping<br/>
I'm riding spinners like a pimp<br/>
That's why I'm limping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Off substances that's controlled<br/>
That's how this story goes<br/>
I popped the cap, broke the ice<br/>
And Lil' Flip done broke the mold<br/>
I'm so cold I think I, see dead people<br/>
Nah, that's just my homies passed out in the Regal<br/>
Believe it, the potency is so strong, if you notice me<br/>
I'm calm, cool, and collected and if you, disrespect it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Flip]</i><br/>
We doing this for them players that bank screw music<br/>
We don't pass out after 8 blunts, because we used to it<br/>
Me and Cris like cheech &amp; chong<br/>
So hurry, break out the weed and the bong<br/>
'Cause if it ain't Grade A trees, we gotta leave it alone<br/>
And to my homie screw, you know I gotta hold it down<br/>
And if they want it then they gotta come and take the crown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Man talking]</i><br/>
Hahahahahaha So there you have it<br/>
Sending this one out to all my drinkers and all my smokers<br/>
United and lighted we stand inebriated we fall<br/>
And if you wanna pass the sobriety and breathalyzer test<br/>
Hear's a quick Luda tip some packets of mustard in your car<br/>
Keep mustard god damn it and whoever said the south can't rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
