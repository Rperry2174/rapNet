Yeah nigga got that Ludacris<br/>
Got that UGK that Disturbing the Peace Click<br/>
And you know what I'm tired of?<br/>
I'm tired of these flashing ass flossing ass niggas<br/>
So if you see one you know what you do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Stick em up stick em up bitch stick em up<br/>
Put ya hands up where I can see em see em see em<br/>
Stick em up stick em up bitch stick em up<br/>
Target niggas wouldn't wanna be em be em be em<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C]</i><br/>
Uh, I want the money and the power they hittin me every hour<br/>
For the silt resin powder chasing them dirty dollars<br/>
I'm from Texas nigga it get hectic nigga<br/>
People depending on me I can't neglect it niggas<br/>
Cause the game is deeper than just working off the beeper<br/>
If the paper ain't right then we calling a sweeper<br/>
To clean up the problems and straighten the mess<br/>
So nigga come wit ya pistol and nigga come wit ya vest<br/>
This ain't the east or the west the 'bama weed or the stress<br/>
I'm Young Pimp from Port Arthur and we done passed the test<br/>
And we smoking the best everywhere that we go<br/>
And when our records come out them bitches sell out the sto'<br/>
Stayin throat on the 'dro and keep that thang on the flo'<br/>
Want my money up front when we come for the show<br/>
Y'all can play wit ya paper but I'm dying for mine<br/>
So while y'all buying them watches I'm gonna stay on the grind<br/>
Fuck Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Hollow laid, hollow sprayed, I'm the hollow man<br/>
I get to my hollow point wit my hollow plan<br/>
Hollow bullets I pull it I'm about to live in vain<br/>
And then I drill em refill em make sure they feel the pain<br/>
It's mighty strange how your peephole is my fucking gauge<br/>
Catch you in concert and then wipe you off the fucking stage<br/>
I feel a ghetto rage let's turn the ghetto page<br/>
My bitch will stick you wit ghetto metal stilleto thangs<br/>
And I got a ghetto aim with diamond 'bezeled rangs<br/>
So while my index is working my pinky's blinding thangs<br/>
I hit em at close range I spit em at most brains<br/>
You think you real rich nigga we gonna make some chump change<br/>
You think it's a fucking game you think it's a blood sport<br/>
You gasping for breath and I'm puffin on one of these Newports<br/>
And I see a red dot aimed at yo head<br/>
Then bright lights oh no po-po and guess what they said<br/>
They said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun-B]</i><br/>
Say nigga you think it's a joke?<br/>
Trill niggas be going for broke<br/>
Twist this whistle loc and them motherfucking pistols smoke<br/>
And it's just a matter of time before you labeled a busta<br/>
I just the nigga that couldn't catch up and cut the mustard<br/>
Now I got confidence I don't need no condiments<br/>
All I need is common sense to see through your incompetence<br/>
Nigga keep your compliments they don't flatter me<br/>
And that'll be the day bitch we don't play you know where the gat'll be<br/>
huh, right on the side of me (side of me)<br/>
Right where it's 'posed to be ('posed to be)<br/>
Bitch niggas die for me (die for me)<br/>
Just for getting too close to me (close to me)<br/>
So kiss your rosery beads and sing a silent one cause<br/>
I promise if you get it it's gone be a violent one<br/>
Coroner catching his breath like he's got asthma<br/>
When they cut on the blue light and see all that fucking plasma<br/>
Millennium murder master nigga I ain't new to this<br/>
So when you see that Bun-B young pimp or that Ludacris<br/>
You just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
ATL the PAT UGK and DTP<br/>
(I wouldn't wanna be em be em be em)<br/>
Shawn Drey I twenty Ludacris and Fake Fees<br/>
(I wouldn't wanna be em be em be em)<br/>
Down South how we do it Pimp C and Bun-B<br/>
(I wouldn't wanna be em be em be em)<br/>
Roll trees ride D's make cheese and shake fleas<br/>
(I wouldn't wanna be em be em be em)
