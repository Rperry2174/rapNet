<i>[Chorus: Carl Thomas]</i><br/>
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)<br/>
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times<br/>
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)<br/>
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times<br/>
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)<br/>
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times<br/>
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)<br/>
Hard times (hard), hard times (hard)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Ludacris]</i><br/>
You never know how much you miss a person, until they gone<br/>
Like to hear it?  Hear it go, I'm rehearsing, gotta sing my song<br/>
I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right<br/>
Cause life is like a big fight<br/>
I'm stickin-and-movin, tryin to get my shit right<br/>
My family's been houndin me, friends they done turned against me<br/>
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty<br/>
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same<br/>
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game<br/>
This industry FUCKED UP<br/>
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever<br/>
Keep real niggaz around me, stay "Space Age 4 Eva"<br/>
Po-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree<br/>
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me<br/>
Your son was DUI, but my momma made it by<br/>
I didn't shed no tears when you left me<br/>
but the rest of the family cried<br/>
Trials and tribulations, ruined my concentration<br/>
Losin my patience, hard times for goodness sake'n<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Eightball]</i><br/>
As this Valium slowly starts to kick in<br/>
Them subconcious, subliminal thoughts, start tickin<br/>
This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin<br/>
Babies doin dope cause daddy did it right in front of them<br/>
Everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids<br/>
Sittin up in the court talkin 'bout Eminem made me do what I did<br/>
My own hard times rolled in like the fog<br/>
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts<br/>
My momma, in 1967, pickin cotton<br/>
While other blacks was gettin liberated, boycottin<br/>
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin that<br/>
He started tootin then he graduated to smokin crack<br/>
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker<br/>
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin gutter<br/>
I tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it<br/>
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: MJG]</i><br/>
A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes<br/>
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe<br/>
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night<br/>
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life<br/>
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me<br/>
Knowin without a, household father, things could get crazy<br/>
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all<br/>
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all<br/>
I graduated out of nothin, not out of school, it was like<br/>
12, 13, 14 years I'm thinkin cool<br/>
I might as well, be focusin on me tryin to get paid<br/>
Usin these rhymes I've been writin since in the 7th grade<br/>
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage<br/>
It was just like a piece of pussy<br/>
It fucked me long as I stayed<br/>
But still I prayed, Lord I'm tryin now please help me out the water<br/>
It can't get no harder<br/>
Help me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i>
