<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Hey, yeah! I want all you proud sistas to stand up<br/>
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight<br/>
Brothers and Sisters if you know you got your thing together<br/>
I want you to stand on up, now I got somethin' to tell ya'<br/>
I told ya' how to think about it, now I want to tell how to get the thing together<br/>
So come on now and get up to it yall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows<br/>
And wonder why the line's around the corner<br/>
Cuz the little motherfucker has the dopest shows<br/>
So one time for my independant women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake<br/>
Two times for my dawgs pullin' triggers<br/>
And my niggaz in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight<br/>
East coast, west coast, midwest, dirty south<br/>
Then we took it all around the world<br/>
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys ans girls<br/>
Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood,<br/>
Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode<br/>
Hip hop, R&amp;B, Pop-tart, what you want?<br/>
I even got a little rock 'n' roll<br/>
The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal<br/>
<i>[Boom boom]</i> cuz they cant get what I gots<br/>
They want it so bad, four million dollar pad<br/>
And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!<br/>
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground<br/>
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope<br/>
They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time<br/>
And I'm about to make 'em choke<br/>
Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach<br/>
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon)<br/>
<br/>
Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves<br/>
Boy I tell you the truth, know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
While he doin' shows, I'm in these skreets, know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
While he on tv, I'm in these skreets<br/>
And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it<br/>
Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear<br/>
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though<br/>
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National<br/>
I got my own record label, you heard of us<br/>
The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real<br/>
Who this nigga thing he is?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'ma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times<br/>
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs<br/>
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk<br/>
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk<br/>
Ooh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops<br/>
People in the way wanna baller block<br/>
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots<br/>
And I'm not to be fucked with<br/>
If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick<br/>
I tried to tell 'em, but they dont wanna listen<br/>
I tried to shine 'em, but they dont wanna glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'<br/>
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools<br/>
Cuz rules were made to be broken, but you cant make broken rules<br/>
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said<br/>
Hear what they playin', cuz thru this music I'ma still be heard if I'm dead<br/>
Call ya' producers, cuz I'm hurtin' these beats<br/>
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, folk<br/>
The King of the kings has spoken<br/>
ATL shawty! Hood to hood, block to block<br/>
We bouta let our nuts hang!<br/>
Disturbin' Tha Peace!<br/>
We dont die, we multiply<br/>
We makin Def Jam history<br/>
Thanks for gettin' the CD shawty!
