<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Why haven't I heard from you?<br/>
I've been busy<br/>
Well, have you at least thought about what we talked about?<br/>
Yea, about livin with you?<br/>
Yea, I thought about it<br/>
Why are you trippin<br/>
<br/>
Oh you talkin bout that girl from up there up the street, right?<br/>
Oh, yea nigga I did<br/>
I heard about that bitch, man<br/>
Aye, she a trip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I be like, I be like damn she got a way about her<br/>
And everybody always got something to say about her<br/>
She so fine, she so classy but that bitch mean<br/>
Everybody wanna throw a little dirt up on er but that bitch clean<br/>
Quit hatin on er, recognize er from a mile away<br/>
When she be walkin and it's hard to find the words to say<br/>
When she be talkin, disrespect it, pay no never mind<br/>
Well she just grill, undressin up, she known to take her time<br/>
And go and kill em<br/>
Hit the club and make these bitches sweat<br/>
Not even tryin<br/>
Turnin heads just off her silhouette<br/>
And I ain't lyin<br/>
I'm a say somebody taught her well<br/>
She'd never slip and I think she's out here castin spells<br/>
I'm tryna tell you shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
That bitch a trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
That girl a trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
Yea, that girl a trip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yea girl like that pussy stay wet<br/>
Fuck er, keep er in check<br/>
Girl if money have her impressed<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
(I'm tryna tell ya'll like I don't believe er)<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
No matter what, she always on the grind<br/>
It seems she know just what to do to stay up on my mind<br/>
She send me pics of her naked pose and like in a magazine<br/>
I wanna hit it like a drum whenever she go and shake it like a tambourine<br/>
Yea, that percussion and she always got the latest bag<br/>
Her shoe game stupid and she never fights and never nags<br/>
She a keep it movin, got no time for games, lames<br/>
False claims, callin out names<br/>
Dames all in the same thing, man<br/>
End of discussion, what you thought she'll throw you for a loop<br/>
That was expected, you might even let er drive your coupe<br/>
She'll never wreck it<br/>
She respect the finer things, diamond rings, diamond chains<br/>
Down to carry Vera Wang's, get a grip<br/>
She a motherfuckin trip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
That bitch a trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
That girl a trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
Yea, that girl a trip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yea girl like that pussy stay wet<br/>
Fuck er, keep er in check<br/>
Girl if money have her impressed<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
(Going crazy here, man)<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
That bitch a trip if I ain't never seen it<br/>
I get up in the gut, she be telling to beat it like I fuckin mean it<br/>
I can't believe it<br/>
Got a nigga thinkin that maybe I done met my match<br/>
So I put her in the track and yes in fact you'll catch me spendin stacks<br/>
Ball up in sacks and I ain't never been the one to trip<br/>
Like what am I doing?<br/>
But it's something about the way that she ride that dick<br/>
My mind is ruined and she using it to her advantage<br/>
She love that I'm grown but I think she got some other victims<br/>
I'm not alone<br/>
Who woulda thought this bad bitch was out here pimpin?<br/>
'Cause a nigga sippin, rippin tags off the latest clothes and bags, she so bad<br/>
That she can't go nowhere without a bunch of niggas tryna holler<br/>
But she all about that buck and all about that mighty dollar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
That bitch a trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
That girl a trip<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
Yea, that girl a trip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yea girl like that pussy stay wet<br/>
Fuck er, keep er in check<br/>
Girl if money have her impressed<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip<br/>
She wanna ride with me on jets<br/>
