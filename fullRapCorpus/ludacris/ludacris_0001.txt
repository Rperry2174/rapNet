<i>[Chorus: Repeat 2X]</i><br/>
I hate it when it's too many niggaz, not enough hoes<br/>
Too many rookies, not enough pros<br/>
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit<br/>
So all y'all can suck my dick, BEOTCH!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical FOOL<br/>
We dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels<br/>
No holds barred but obey the block rules<br/>
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools<br/>
Are there anyone like ya (HELL NAW!!)<br/>
I treat humans like students (FAIL Y'ALL)<br/>
So turn ya books to page 69 and start suckin<br/>
When Organized drop the tracks then start duckin<br/>
When Ludacris get in the bed start fuckin<br/>
<i>[Girl:]</i> You wanna be startin some'n <br/>
Get out the booth <br/>
and lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's<br/>
Save all the H20 for front rows<br/>
Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes<br/>
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road<br/>
If you know what I mean proceed to stay clean<br/>
Light skinded nigga turn red but get green<br/>
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam<br/>
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<i>[Girl:]</i> Boy you done lost yo' mind<br/>
No I've lost my virginity<br/>
And I shot click like that fool shot Kennedy<br/>
What's the remedy Hennessey Coke<br/>
If you cut all your money you'd still be half broke<br/>
Ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked<br/>
We come by the masses you come and get choked<br/>
If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke<br/>
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope<br/>
So now we eatin lobster shrimp and things<br/>
And watch for imposters that's been in the game<br/>
We invented the game and y'all just got hip<br/>
<i>[Dude:]</i> Man what's that smell <br/>
PROBABLY YO UPPER LIP<br/>
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank<br/>
Even if it's cigars and that purple color dank<br/>
Chillin in the gut with no trace of Tom Hanks<br/>
So put this in yo' jaw like weiners and beef franks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I put too much sugar in my Kool..Aid<br/>
And party like a kid wit a high top fade<br/>
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid<br/>
Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid<br/>
Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats<br/>
I'm on the right page but what's my format<br/>
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at<br/>
And women go nuts just like my bozack<br/>
Did you know that?  Man I'm the gift of change<br/>
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range<br/>
Shagadelic, beautiful but strange<br/>
Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames<br/>
Rearrange, same broad different night<br/>
Pass the E&amp;J and let a nigga get right<br/>
The bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight<br/>
The highlight's that I live a high ass life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 3X (w/ minor variations)]</i>
