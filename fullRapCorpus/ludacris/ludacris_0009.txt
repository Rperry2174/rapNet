<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
All this drinking gon catch up<br/>
And all this smoking gon catch up<br/>
But some niggaz just really don't give a fuck<br/>
But some niggaz just relly don't give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
And all this drinking gon catch up<br/>
And all this smoking gon catch up<br/>
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck<br/>
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now let me be quite Frank<br/>
Cause I'm that crazy nigga Luda<br/>
Always got a drink<br/>
And I'm steady smoking buddah<br/>
I do the<br/>
Evil that'll bend you when I get you<br/>
I'mma sit you down<br/>
Then take it to the mental and essential and clown<br/>
Every chance I get<br/>
Bitch I'm hit<br/>
Not by no bullet or no pellet <br/>
But the smoke from the can a beer shit<br/>
I might just be too high<br/>
Then I put my middle finger up when I'm ridin' by<br/>
And say hi to plenty liquors and I know it's a sin<br/>
And if ya tell me stop drinking I'll just do it again<br/>
So when I get old I'mma rock, roll, shake, and shiver<br/>
With some blacked out lungs and a fucked up liver<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Infamous 2-0]</i><br/>
Ey yo I do this for bluntheads and whinos <br/>
Steward Ave. Homes<br/>
Niggaz from G-Ro committed to slanging blo<br/>
Doublin' dough 24-7<br/>
Fuck po-po's I'm blowin' dro out the Ac Legend<br/>
Runnin wit 2 strike felons<br/>
And I pack 4-4's like Hank Aaron<br/>
Then'll smoke a L<br/>
Bust shells<br/>
And dare ya to tell<br/>
Walk up in the club<br/>
Pretty thug<br/>
Fucked up off head shots<br/>
Sippin' Courvousier watchin' hoes drop it like it's<br/>
hot<br/>
Shaking tits and twats<br/>
Placing big face 20's and cock<br/>
Loading clips and glocks<br/>
Knowing we got the haters hot<br/>
The ballin' don't stop<br/>
Just drop more G's on drink and drugs<br/>
Live it up young nigga cause it's gon' catch up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[F.A.T.E.]</i><br/>
Now wit the help of Hen and Coke<br/>
I grab my pen and pad and wrote<br/>
Something that I knew was dope<br/>
And represent for my kinfolk<br/>
Pimp a hoe until she broke<br/>
Wit mo lines than chopped coke<br/>
Ey yo it's 2-0 I'm Eastside's King<br/>
But I'm a writer with a twist of Amaretta<br/>
My shit even come out better<br/>
Grab a blunt put it together<br/>
What a nigga really need<br/>
Run up in the club and blow a motherfucker til he<br/>
bleed<br/>
Could it be an Icehouse put his lights out<br/>
Or the club get closed out<br/>
If it's hoes out I show out<br/>
Call Tyheed get Dro'd out<br/>
There's no doubt I love my life<br/>
Love the light<br/>
Love to write<br/>
Love the mic<br/>
So take a drag<br/>
Grab a bag and match up<br/>
Hennessey and bad weed<br/>
Believe me it catch up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[F.A.T.E.]</i><br/>
Git it right<br/>
Ludacris, F.A.T.E. Fullster, Infamous 2-0, ATL<br/>
We are the dirty south's dirtiest.  Disturbing the peace.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[White guy]</i><br/>
Hey bring on the bitches!!
