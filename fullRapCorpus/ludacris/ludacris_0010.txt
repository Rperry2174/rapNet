<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Uhh..<br/>
Cadillac grills, Cadillac mill's<br/>
Check out the oil my Cadillac spills<br/>
Matter of fact, candy paint Cadillacs kill<br/>
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills<br/>
Twenty inch - wide, twenty inches high<br/>
Hoe don't you like my twenty inch - ride<br/>
Twenty inch thighs make twenty inch - eyes<br/>
Hoping for American twenty inch - pies<br/>
Pretty ass - clothes, pretty ass - toes<br/>
Oh how I love these pretty ass - hoes<br/>
Pretty ass high class anything - goes<br/>
Catch 'em in the club throwin pretty ass 'bows<br/>
Long-john drawers, long-john stalls<br/>
Any stank puss' make my long john - pause<br/>
Women on they cell makin long john calls<br/>
And if they like to juggle, get long john's - balls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
All my players in the house that can buy the bar<br/>
And the ballin-ass niggaz wit the candy cars<br/>
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes<br/>
When you get on the flo' - nigga throw dem 'bows<br/>
All my women in the house if you chasin cash<br/>
And you got some big titties wit a matchin ass<br/>
Witcha fly-ass boots or ya open toes<br/>
When ya get on the flo' - nigga throw dem 'bows<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Dirty South mind blowin Dirty South bread<br/>
Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed<br/>
Sleep in a cot'-pickin Dirty South bed<br/>
Dirty South guls gimme Dirty South head<br/>
Hand me down flip-flops, hand me down socks<br/>
Hand me down drug dealers hand me down rocks<br/>
Hand me down a 50 pack Swisher Sweets box<br/>
And goodfella rich niggaz hand me down stocks<br/>
Mouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold<br/>
Forty glock cal' keep your mouth on hold<br/>
Lie through your teeth you could find your mouth - cold<br/>
and rip out ya tongue cause of what ya mouth - told<br/>
Sweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea<br/>
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D<br/>
And you can sweat from a burn in the third degree<br/>
And if you sweat in your sleep then you sweat from me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Hit by - stars, hit by - cars<br/>
Drunk off the liquor gettin hit by - bars<br/>
Keep yo' gul close cause she's hit by - far<br/>
Hit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars<br/>
Afro - picks, afro - chicks<br/>
I let my "Soul Glow" from my afro - dick<br/>
Rabbit out the hat pullin afro - tricks<br/>
Afro-American afro - thick<br/>
Overall country, overall jeans<br/>
Overall Georgia, we overall clean<br/>
"Southern Hospitality" or overall mean<br/>
Overall triple, overall beams<br/>
Thugged out niggaz wear thugged out - chains<br/>
Thugged out blocks playin thugged out - games<br/>
All black tinted up thugged out - Range<br/>
DTP stay doing thugged out - thangs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
.. (nigga throw dem 'bows)<br/>
.. (nigga throw dem 'bows)<br/>
.. (nigga throw dem 'bows)<br/>
.. (nigga throw dem 'bows)
