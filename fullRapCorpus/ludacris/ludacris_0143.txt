<i>[Miguel:]</i><br/>
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe<br/>
Know what I need, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel:]</i><br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see<br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all<br/>
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol<br/>
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you<br/>
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you<br/>
Is it easier to erase my memories<br/>
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?<br/>
Some on the fence, some befriended me<br/>
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy<br/>
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work<br/>
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt<br/>
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl<br/>
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel:]</i><br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see<br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
I got a empty hole in my chest<br/>
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription<br/>
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets<br/>
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission<br/>
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom<br/>
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?<br/>
Need solutions, less problems<br/>
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum<br/>
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em<br/>
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em<br/>
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone<br/>
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel:]</i><br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see<br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel:]</i><br/>
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby<br/>
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high<br/>
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed<br/>
On an empty bed<br/>
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat<br/>
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high<br/>
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed<br/>
While I lose my mind<br/>
So you know what I need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Miguel:]</i><br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see<br/>
I need some real good lovin'<br/>
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
