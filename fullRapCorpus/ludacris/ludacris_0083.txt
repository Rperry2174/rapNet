<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
A lady in the street but a freak in the bed<br/>
Lady in the street but a freak in the bed...<br/>
Lady in the street but a freak in the bed<br/>
Lady in the street but a freak in the bed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ludacris]</i><br/>
See she makes her own money, pays her own bills<br/>
Always stays fly, keeps it so real<br/>
But behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)<br/>
Behind closed do's she a nasty girl<br/>
She got a crazy little figure, nice round ass<br/>
Walks so proper, talks with such class<br/>
But behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)<br/>
Behind closed do's she a nasty girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, I met this girl named Keisha, she was so sweet (yup)<br/>
Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet (woo!)<br/>
Shoes so sexy, body so hot<br/>
Hair lookin like she just came from the shop<br/>
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight<br/>
Style so sexy, makeup just right<br/>
Never too much, never too little<br/>
Black lace bra, Vickie Secrets in the middle<br/>
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright<br/>
Works in the mornin but she'll party all night<br/>
All for her man, all cause she bout it<br/>
All cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it<br/>
Product of her birthplace, know about the streets<br/>
Clean in the workplace, dirty in the sheets<br/>
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread<br/>
Lady in the STREET but a freak in the bed, cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Plies]</i><br/>
Okay, okay, haha<br/>
I got a college girl who go to church e'ry Sunday<br/>
Had her sneak out of choir rehearsal to put it on me<br/>
But she's so innocent, when she ridin, mami<br/>
One thing about her, she get her own money<br/>
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin laundry<br/>
Favorite chore of mine, it's my lil' bunny<br/>
Bowl-legged and classy, such a real woman<br/>
Sex all night, go to work e'ry mornin<br/>
Text me from work and told me she was horny<br/>
Text her back and told her, "Me too mami"<br/>
When you get off work, daddy gon' punish<br/>
You my nasty girl forever I promise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me, "Come home soon!"<br/>
She plays like my house is her emergency room<br/>
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa<br/>
Checks all my vitals like a doc's supposed ta<br/>
All white coat, all white heels<br/>
And nothin underneath so it's an all night deal<br/>
I'm her number one patient and delighted to be<br/>
And when she needs her medicine I give her vitamin D<br/>
But wait! I got a lawyer girl that's so wild<br/>
And every single night she wanna take me to trial<br/>
Said she needs some evidence, and to show her the PROOF<br/>
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth!<br/>
Cause I'm hung like a jury (jury)<br/>
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry<br/>
You may proceed, let the games begin<br/>
And if I call a mistrial we gotta do it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
