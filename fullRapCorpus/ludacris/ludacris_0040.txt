<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Hi, my name's Ludacris and I'm high as giraffes (yeah)<br/>
And I'm close to the edge so your parents can come push me<br/>
I curse so much just to get on they nerves<br/>
I got kids acting a fool from the traps to the birbs<br/>
My filthy mouf it wont fight cavities or beat plaque<br/>
So I shot the tooth fairy (aahhh) and took my old teeth back<br/>
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater<br/>
And make Government officials breath harder than Darth Vader<br/>
Its the chicken &amp; the beer that make Luda keep rapping<br/>
But no pork on my fork I don't even speak pig Latin<br/>
I go fishing on my lake wit some bitches to bake<br/>
Plus I eat many MC's but I don't gain no weight<br/>
The number 1 chief rocker clean out your rap lockers<br/>
I'm as stiff as a board your more shook than maracas<br/>
But my tricks ain't for kids if you dig em' you'll get smacked<br/>
I'll clock yah, I'll spring forward you far back (whoo)<br/>
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers (yeah)<br/>
Thats cause I'm a shot caller ya'll fools are crank yankers (bells)<br/>
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain<br/>
I get chicks from Portland Oregan to Portland Mayne<br/>
Now I role up torpedoes, get blunted wit rastas<br/>
For a hefty fee I'm on your record like Bob Castas (yeah)<br/>
I own so many jerseys, I'm a throw-back mess<br/>
I hit the cleaners an tell em' "I want a full court press" (owe)<br/>
So mama toast yah glass while I'm counting my cash<br/>
Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camels ass (ha)<br/>
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost<br/>
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash<br/>
From your car to crap game no one rolls with you<br/>
One of MiniMe's shoes got more soul than you (OK)<br/>
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinning<br/>
I'm in the strip club smoking, wit President Clinton (cough cough cough)<br/>
So stay of the long side-burns and gold teeth (teeth)<br/>
They make the mold of the penis enlarger off me (me)<br/>
I'll be in another when I hit from the back (back)<br/>
Not to mention my refrigerators taller than Shaq (yeah)<br/>
So yippie ka ye yippie ya ya yo (yo), if you can't swim don't smoke my hydro (dro)<br/>
I've been looking for a woman just to put my stamp on<br/>
But a lotta ya'll are more stuck up than tampons (whoo)<br/>
So wash all you sins away and stop playing (yeah)<br/>
If God's line is busy you might have to two way him (uh hmm)<br/>
And catch me in your back yard playing crokay<br/>
And I'm drunk I'm telling kids "drugs are bad umm-kay"<br/>
Or watch me swing my chains at the Roscoes off Pico<br/>
Got seven cars get on my rims at chrome depo<br/>
And people think I'm bad they say "ooh he's so evil"<br/>
Cause I go on blind dates with actual blind people (owe)<br/>
But my albums out the store, yours be on the shelf (uh hmm)<br/>
I heard you masturbate a lot so ya'll keep to yourself<br/>
Cause these women want a man to stay up and stay strong<br/>
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home<br/>
All that shit that ya'll talking ya'll can pop it to them<br/>
Cause Ludacris will beat you down with a prosthetic limb<br/>
I'll put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it<br/>
And your breath'll turn to Footlocker water repelant<br/>
I'm the man I got money far as the eyes can see<br/>
And I'm in a group I split do wit me me and me<br/>
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry<br/>
So ima trade my earings in, and get a Ferrari (whoo)<br/>
I buy cars wit straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump<br/>
Yall meet wit Honda, no payments for 12 months (uh huh)<br/>
Take a look at your life and no wonder your so sad<br/>
Ya'll put up wit more shit than a colostomy bag<br/>
Ha ha ha
