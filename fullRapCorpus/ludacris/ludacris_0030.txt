<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Welcome to Atlanta, jackin' hammers and vogues<br/>
Back to the mackin' and jackin the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'<br/>
A knock on the do', who is it? I would happen to know<br/>
The one with the flow - who did it?, it was me I suppose<br/>
JD in the Rolls and Luda's in the Cut Supreme<br/>
Skatin down Old Nat, gat tucked and leaned<br/>
I split ya spleen, as a matter of fact I split ya team<br/>
No blood on the sneaks, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean<br/>
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams<br/>
I'm allergic so doc' prescribed antihistamines<br/>
Oink oink, pig pig, do away with the pork<br/>
Only silverware I needs a steak knife and a fork<br/>
Did you forget your fuckin manners, I'm Bruce with Banners<br/>
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when I shoot the cannon<br/>
The wooly mammoth sabretooth, bitch bite your tongue<br/>
I won't stop until I'm rich as them whites'll come<br/>
I pulled up in the black Lotus, your plaques are bogus<br/>
So I stripped them off the wall<br/>
Waitin for my cue to corner pocket eight balls, you rackin 'em up<br/>
I'm big paper like pancakes, stackin 'em up<br/>
In fact I'm slappin 'em up, Cadallac'n the truck<br/>
I can't loose with twenty-two, bitch that's what's up<br/>
Runnin in the back to fuck, better tha-than the aquaduct<br/>
Chil-li-li-li-li-n.. fli-pi-pi-pi-pi-n, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri:]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo<br/>
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo<br/>
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo<br/>
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J.D. followed by Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play<br/>
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day<br/>
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin<br/>
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the mo'nin<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play<br/>
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day<br/>
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin<br/>
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri:]</i><br/>
Yo, uhh<br/>
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in<br/>
And I usually don't leave until the thang ends<br/>
But in the meantime, in between time<br/>
You work yo' thing, I'll work mine<br/>
I been puttin it down here since eighty-three<br/>
Since the Lakeshore/MD rivalry<br/>
When Frozen Paradise was the place to be<br/>
If you was ridin, you was bumping to homie Shy-D<br/>
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player<br/>
Make my own rules, bitch call me the mayor<br/>
Monday night, Gentlemen's Club<br/>
Tuesday night, I'm up in the Velvet Room, gettin fucked up<br/>
Wednesday, I'm at Strokers on lean<br/>
Thursday, Jump Clean, then I fall up in Kream<br/>
Friday, Shark Bar, Kaya with Frank Ski<br/>
Right on the flo' is where you can find me<br/>
Saturday, is off the heezy fo' sheezy<br/>
You can find me up in One-Tweezy<br/>
Sunday, is when I get my sleep in<br/>
Cause on Monday we be at it again, holla!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri:]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo<br/>
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo<br/>
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo<br/>
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo<br/>
