Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go<br/>
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby!!<br/>
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh!  Here we go, here we go<br/>
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Check it<br/>
You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor<br/>
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers<br/>
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers<br/>
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor<br/>
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for ya health<br/>
See I ain't gotta say SHIT!  Money speaks for itself<br/>
With all models I make I'm +Great+ like five +Lakes+<br/>
You got rims on ya truck?  Man I got rims in my skates!<br/>
You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs<br/>
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub<br/>
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers<br/>
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters<br/>
Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs<br/>
Then I, put 'em on camera and cut two frames<br/>
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to hell<br/>
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail!<br/>
I got junkyard dawgs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper<br/>
And my baby's assed out, cause I rub my cars with her diapers<br/>
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past<br/>
"Word of Mouf" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[4-Ize]</i><br/>
These rap cats is soft like R&amp;B singers<br/>
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers<br/>
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen<br/>
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean<br/>
I rip meanface niggas one by one<br/>
or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come<br/>
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking<br/>
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking<br/>
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade<br/>
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?<br/>
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher<br/>
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya<br/>
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes<br/>
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows<br/>
I rock Shaq's clothes when I alter beast<br/>
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace<br/>
<br/>
