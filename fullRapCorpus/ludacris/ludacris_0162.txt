<i>[Bridge - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
I came to party like tonight will never end<br/>
Let's party again<br/>
Let's party again<br/>
Yea, I came to party like tonight will never end<br/>
Let's party again<br/>
Let's party again<br/>
Let's party again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
I need party girls in my party world<br/>
Titties plastic, ass fantastic<br/>
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere<br/>
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked<br/>
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked<br/>
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked<br/>
Say shit and they be gettin' naked<br/>
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ludacris:]</i><br/>
It's your world and I'ma touch wherever you want me to touch it<br/>
Pop that, pop that and you'll be bustin' them nuts when you want to bust it<br/>
Don't rush it mama I'ma take my time and do it slow<br/>
From the car to the counter to the bed to the couch to the tub to the flo'<br/>
Oh! No! Could it be that a G really got you sprung?<br/>
I lost my count baby how many times did I make it cum?<br/>
Run, run, run from a nigga til you can't no more like Forrest Gump<br/>
If it's more she wants, Then it's more she gets<br/>
She's spoiled rotten like bad milk<br/>
Get her hot cause I make that ass melt<br/>
She whipped cause she love gettin' whipped in the whip<br/>
And I'ma black belt<br/>
I beat the pussy to pieces, never lettin' the cat off the leashes<br/>
And I'm goin' so deep they tellin' me all of they deepest and darkest secrets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Throw some ones on that<br/>
Get you wet as a waterpark I'ma have some fun with that<br/>
Make you come back to back you gon' bust like a gun with that<br/>
Like pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr<br/>
My bitch be gettin' down nigga how 'bout yours?<br/>
So turnt up when we in the club we don't even need a molly<br/>
Doin' so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin' in the party<br/>
My lung's filled with Marley<br/>
My hands on your body<br/>
And I'm goin' so deep I'm just lettin' you know that this me I got your face all in the pillow<br/>
You can't speak<br/>
<br/>
