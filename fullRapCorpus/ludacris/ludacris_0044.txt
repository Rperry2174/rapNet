<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Gotta feel me on this one<br/>
Ain't none of this shit happen overnight<br/>
We talking about a long time coming motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Dolla Boy + (Tity Boi)]</i><br/>
It ain't clean on these streets(uh, uh)<br/>
It's mean on these streets(yeah)<br/>
Blocks up, hats down<br/>
Fiends on these these streets<br/>
(So please pay attention when you coming around<br/>
Cause the blocks got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm still back for the first damn time<br/>
So grab a hold of your seat while I OPEN YOUR MIND<br/>
And take you back from when I dropped down from heaven<br/>
And I came on my moms and I had a MIC as my fucking weapon<br/>
When I was three I was just a little G<br/>
But if you looked in my eyes you would see the future of a real MC<br/>
And at the age of nine I wrote my first ryhme<br/>
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pasttimes<br/>
Everywhere that I went spitting and dabbling<br/>
Showing my ass growing up and started traveling<br/>
From one city to the next luda landed in the ATL<br/>
Where the pimps and the players dwell<br/>
I made a tape did shows and got EX-PO-SURE<br/>
And kept learning as my black ass got OLDER<br/>
No matter what I just kept at my trade<br/>
I made mistakes but still stayed sharper than a GINSUI BLADE<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Age 14, my talent show, a beast out of cage<br/>
Would have won, but got disqualified for JUMPING OFF STAGE<br/>
But I didn't care cause this game started to open it's arms<br/>
When I was at Banaker High School pulling fire alarms<br/>
So I could get a crowd around me make a name for my BLOCK<br/>
People told me keep flowing they didn't want me to STOP<br/>
Back when big nose John was my human beatbox<br/>
Skipped out on school hit open campus and look out for street COPS<br/>
Now I'm known around the town as that "Nigga who raps"<br/>
From the hill of Maze high to them G roll traps<br/>
And I was still making demos perfecting the craft<br/>
Some said I wouldn't make it they would giggle and laugh<br/>
So I picked up a couple books from DONALD GOINES<br/>
About the busimess of this shit and how to FLIP A FEW COINS<br/>
By the age of eighteen I was destined to MAKE IT<br/>
My bank account read DISTURBING THE PEACE INCORPORATED<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Age 18, I'm struggling just to survive<br/>
But I got a gig working for change at 97.5<br/>
Now I'm rapping on the radio increasing their NUMBERS<br/>
Still Ludacris, but Alias was Chris LOVA, LOVA<br/>
Late nights I'm in the studio using they tools<br/>
Me and Poon was smoking weed and breaking all of they rtules<br/>
And I was krunk, ALL THE BIG WIGS WAS HEARING MY SONGS<br/>
But nobody did SHIT and they was taking too long<br/>
Three years went past and I saved enough cash<br/>
To make my own record company and put my self on BLAST<br/>
the album was independent it was just for the streets<br/>
I sold one thousand albums in my first fucking week<br/>
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand<br/>
All the record companies biting, but I chose Def Jam<br/>
The main reason that I made it and I love the A town<br/>
Was because the BLOCK had it's EYEBROWS DOWN, ya heard me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yah, Ive' been waiting a lifetime to get what the fuck I got<br/>
It's real man<br/>
Hardest working nigga in show business<br/>
Believe that<br/>
Shout out to Lil fate, I dub, Chaka Zulu<br/>
Yah Woo<br/>
The people's music I used to play some happy and some jealous<br/>
Cause I'm showered with cash and they can't remove they umbrellas<br/>
The people's music I used to play some happy and some jealous<br/>
Cause I'm showered with cash and they can't remove they umbrellas<br/>
Uh<br/>
<i>[music fades]</i><br/>
You hear it raining don't ya<br/>
You hear it rain
