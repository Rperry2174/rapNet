<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
You have a call from an inmate in a correctional facility<br/>
Inmate, state your name (Darren)<br/>
This phone call may be monitered and recorded<br/>
Press 3 if you accept the charges, if not hang up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
To my cousin Darren Ranch - stay up homie<br/>
To my brother Chris Butler - stay up homie<br/>
If you locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
To my brother Mikey Mike - stay up homie<br/>
To my cuz J.B. - stay up homie<br/>
If you locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
<br/>
You lookin at a man that would<br/>
die for his daughter, just to let her breathe<br/>
And I'd definitely die for Jesus cause he died for me<br/>
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen<br/>
But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream<br/>
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it<br/>
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated<br/>
Locked up in a cell block, lost from the shell shock<br/>
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks<br/>
Look up in my mailbox, I get letters from my cuz<br/>
and every week said he wanna hit the streets<br/>
But he never struck a deal cause his mouth will never squeal<br/>
Put some money on his books and help him out with his appeal<br/>
Send some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna<br/>
If you ever have to leave I got your mother AND your daughter<br/>
Born in this way of livin and our youth is stuck<br/>
To be safe it's safe to say the justice system's FUCKED up!<br/>
<br/>
If you doin 25 to life - stay up homie<br/>
I got your money on ice so - stay up homie<br/>
If you locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
All my peoples in the pit - stay up homie<br/>
And until you hit the bricks - stay up homie<br/>
If you locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Until I went to jail you couldn't tell me, I ain't seen it all<br/>
That box, a motherfucker - it could stress a nigga balls<br/>
Especially when you broke and home base ain't acceptin your calls<br/>
And you don't hear your name when it's mail time<br/>
Caught in damn jailhouse barbers pushin back on your hairline<br/>
Fuckin {?} will have you stuck in that pill line<br/>
Your bitch miss the V-I this weekend<br/>
The food in your locker keeps shrinkin, your celly feet stinkin<br/>
The canteen ran out of menthols<br/>
Can't see how grown men wash other men drawers<br/>
Niggaz play the phone room reckless and get hit with new indictments<br/>
Talkin about old connects and new prices<br/>
Stress'll take a young nigga, give him an old face<br/>
Or stress'll take a dumb nigga, give him a new case<br/>
That shit I used to tell my walkie<br/>
Lil' Itchy, all he did was smoke weed and drink coffee<br/>
I know he miss me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel + (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
To my man Lil' Nell (stay up homie)<br/>
To my man Steve P (stay up homie)<br/>
If you locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
To my man Paul Selene (stay up homie)<br/>
To Abdul McKeith (stay up homie)<br/>
Until I see you in the streets keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C]</i><br/>
Uhh, if your people locked up you need to send 'em some shit<br/>
Cause it's never too late to stop bein a bitch<br/>
A magazine and some pictures is a nigga's whole world<br/>
When I was down them niggaz fell out so I'm ridin with the girls<br/>
Cause they got mo' heart, than them fake ass dudes<br/>
They send no letters, no books, and no money for no food<br/>
Cause commissary is so very necessary<br/>
It's so close to bein slavery, in Texas nigga it's scary<br/>
I reached out to C-Murder right before I came home<br/>
And when him home, let me go I make sure that his books was on<br/>
And three months later that nigga came home too<br/>
Ain't +No Limit+ to this shit cause now his dream's comin +Tru+<br/>
I'ma keep ridin with Bun cause UGK will never stop<br/>
And I'ma stand up for my partner, steady let them off a lot (yeah)<br/>
Biatch, and I'm as trill as you can be<br/>
They scream "Free Pimp C" but not see the pimp free (here I go)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i> C-Murder!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[C-Murder]</i><br/>
Wake up, roll call, another day gone by<br/>
Now put a 'X' on November 25 I'm still alive<br/>
Open the dead roll balls<br/>
Now this dead man walkin parkin million dollar cars<br/>
It's slavery, hard labor, catch the feel<br/>
Redneck on the hearse while you walk, it's real<br/>
With a shotgun, burnin at the back of your dome<br/>
300 years left, my dawg ain't never comin home<br/>
One fight, dude got stabbed, he lost the nine<br/>
Almost died, in Camp Jay{?} nigga, ride or cry<br/>
Cream has suicide attempts, Precious took his own life<br/>
White boys can't handle the pain at night<br/>
You gotta fight for your shoes, or get your ass shook<br/>
And walk around with lipstick, and a pocketbook<br/>
You all in bitch, sit down when you piss<br/>
Sweet ass, you a ho, watch I blow you a kiss (mwah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[C-Murder + (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
To my cousin Jimmy Watson (stay up homie)<br/>
To my homeboy Mack (stay up homie)<br/>
If you locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C + (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
To my nigga Pharoahe (stay up homie)<br/>
To my nigga Z-Ro (stay up homie)<br/>
If you're locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>
Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you<br/>
To the king Larry Hoover (stay up homie)<br/>
To my partner Shan-O you gotta (stay up homie)<br/>
If you're locked in the box keep makin it through<br/>

Do your time (do your time) don't let your time do you
