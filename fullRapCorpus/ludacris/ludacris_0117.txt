<i>[Coughs]</i><br/>
Pass that<br/>
Let me hit that<br/>
C’mon nigga <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ludacris]</i><br/>
What u smokin on, nigga<br/>
What u smokin on<br/>
What u smokin on, nigga<br/>
What u smokin on<br/>
What u smokin on, bitch<br/>
What u smokin on<br/>
What u smokin on, bitch<br/>
What u smokin on<br/>
I get so high<br/>
I get so high<br/>
And fall off in the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
I've fallen and I can't get up, somebody wake me up<br/>
So high that my eyelids low, feelin like I'm in a coma better come shake me up<br/>
What you wanna do Luda? Shit, roll up might as well<br/>
AK-47 to the head then we ain't dead, we just high as hell<br/>
You might know it as weed, grass marijuana, cannabis, sativa<br/>
You may call it cheeba, maybe reefer, Wiz Khalifa<br/>
Smokin on white moonshine, or that anthrax, or that blue dream<br/>
Spread a lil cologne on my clothes feeling like Versace blue jeans<br/>
While y'all smoking that rough weed, that dirt shit, that ragamuff<br/>
I’m smoking on that homegrown and pass out cuz I done had enough<br/>
Of that sour diesel, that northern lights, and that killa Cali<br/>
They see me out up Oahu, Honolulu, smoking that Maui Wowie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Look, don't fret<br/>
You niggas need a better connect, you gotta get your status up<br/>
Y'all smoke that stress, we smoke that shit that won the cannabis cup<br/>
Now I'm higher than a satellite, eating everything like a parasite<br/>
Now we in the streets looking for the baddest dike<br/>
To run a midnight train like Gladys Knight<br/>
I'm higher than the prices at Petro<br/>
Higher than the balloon after you let go<br/>
Cuz I'm smokin on that loud in the middle of a crowd<br/>
And the loud is really louder than techno<br/>
I've got my weed card on the way to the store to get medicinal marijuana<br/>
Luda, study more Buddha than the Dalai Lama<br/>
Granddaddy purp, bubble gum, or the OG Kush<br/>
White widow, or the g13, and the Irene got your homies shook<br/>
But that Jack Herer and the headband got my homies wired<br/>
And the blueberry yum yums that fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
Smokin on that something grown at home, sunken blowin ozs<br/>
Nigga I'm from PGH but all my weed from Califon'<br/>
Can’t find the remote control<br/>
That’s how you know I'm stoned<br/>
All you do is call me, I got all the weed, the papers, bongs<br/>
Brownies, trippy sticks, and vaporizers, we could smoke a bowl<br/>
All these niggas smokin weed around me it's a smoke-a-thon<br/>
Crowded in my whip, its partly cloudy cuz we smokin strong<br/>
You say you can't smoke them joints, probably cuz you rolled it wrong<br/>
My dollars up, I'm gettin em and I’m foldin it<br/>
I'm lighting em, I'm hittin em, I'm not holdin it<br/>
I'm passin them straight to Ludacris and he's smokin it<br/>
Security and a nigga that own a bitch, Askin
