<i>[Ludacris &amp; Pastor Troy]</i><br/>
what (what), what (what), what (what), what (what)<br/>

<i>[Pastor Troy]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Get off me, but I'm on you all day<br/>
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play<br/>
<i>[repeat 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> You wanna rush me, you can't touch me, trust me<br/>
cause you weigh too dusty, and rusty, and musty<br/>
<i>[Troy]</i> You betta shop that make you pop up from lock up<br/>
but you tell your folks to hold you're jack up to back up (to back up)<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room<br/>
<i>[Troy]</i> It ain't nothinnnnn<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> A a watch out watch out, boom<br/>
Call me the hit man, 'cuz I make you wanna call time-out<br/>
Then I make your mom cry-out, when I take your whole spine out<br/>
then watch me take ya, and fake ya, and shake ya, and break ya<br/>
and see you on hoooome to your maker<br/>
<i>[Troy]</i> You should give up now for talkin shit like that<br/>
But then you nothing, you garbage you betta' watch ya' back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Troy]</i> (OK, OK now)<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> I'm in that 2000 excursion<br/>
<i>[Troy]</i> Ridin on 22's, I hear da boom<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> But booms just get more crunk<br/>
<i>[Troy]</i> It's the DSGB forever<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> Ridin on pump<br/>
<i>[Troy]</i> I stunk, or did I say stunk, I meant stank (UN huh)<br/>
I think I'll take it please, or in another coffee break<br/>
you aint, but you can pretend to be homey<br/>
<i>[Luda]</i> I'm stiff arming these busters just as soon they get on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2x]</i>
