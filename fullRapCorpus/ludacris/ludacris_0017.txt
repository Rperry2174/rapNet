<i>[Chorus: Ludacris - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
(Oh No!) I caught him with a blow to the chest       <br/>
(Oh No!) My hollow put a hole in his vest<br/>
(Oh No!) I'm bout to send two to his dome<br/>
(Oh No!) Cry babies go home!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Ludacris]</i><br/>
I got people scared as FUCK like when condoms break<br/>
Or how your heart deals with eatin' eighty pounds of steak<br/>
So put your belly on a plate and watch your weight<br/>
You frostin' like a flake and Ludacris feels grrreat!<br/>
Who want come face me, face come want who?<br/>
And women give me face until they're face turns blue<br/>
They can't breathe, dick to mouth recessatation<br/>
A tight squeeze witch stops the length to conversations<br/>
I Playstations, duck cops and lose agents<br/>
I'm Doctor Love, I close curtains and fuck patients<br/>
When I kick and rip and flip an indespensable rhyme<br/>
My black ass is so hungry I'll take a bite out of crime<br/>
And it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if I choke<br/>
Neighbors called the fire station off the blunt that I smoke<br/>
You see I crush cowards, funerals I'll send flowers<br/>
And I'm on the overpass flick pennies at rush hour<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Ludacris]</i><br/>
You see I'm ambidextrous I slap ass with both hands<br/>
Delete your first steps, but I'll save the last dance<br/>
I just bought some new guns my mama said "it ain't worth it"<br/>
But I'm at the shooting range just 'cause practice makes perfect<br/>
Bullseye, I stunt growth and stop lives<br/>
You run with niggas that's more chicken then pot pies<br/>
Bok bok bok I'm shakin your tale feathers<br/>
I got big balls, I'm a SAC King like Chris Webber<br/>
Luda' will take you back to duck hunt and double dribble<br/>
When niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels<br/>
My cars got big TVs and satellites<br/>
I got a Wheel of Fortune 'cause I flipped O's like Vanna White<br/>
And the servey says? (Kill a mutha fucka now)<br/>
Could it be off with his head? (Or shoot a mutha fucka down)<br/>
Ground round, ground chuck your ground beef<br/>
Bullets gather round then I shoot rounds around teeth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Ludacris]</i><br/>
I kick niggas in they're ass reboot 'em like laptops<br/>
And they wouldn't even box if I gave 'em a flat top<br/>
You punks pucker and pout, bicker and babble<br/>
Now they all lost for words like I beat 'em in Scrabble<br/>
You see I'm from a small town called "Fresh out a cop's ass"<br/>
Where Mr. Head-Potatoes are skinned they get mashed<br/>
I smell puss from fifty yards<br/>
Y'all not playin with full decks as if I jacked out ya Jacks and left fifty cards<br/>
Catch me in Vegas spinnin' the green<br/>
I re-up with more chips than a vending machine<br/>
Then you can catch me in Rome making some brauds and sticking 'em<br/>
And you'll be at home picking your bougars and flicking 'em<br/>
A drug dealer's dream, so fresh and I'm so clean<br/>
I'm a grown ass man and you're sweeter than sixteen<br/>
So go and kick rocks peons you're just rookies<br/>
Headed down stairs to get you some milk and cookies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i>
