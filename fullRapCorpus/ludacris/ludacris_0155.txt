<i>[Hook: Claret Jai]</i><br/>
We’re so furiously dangerous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Death by lyrical injection<br/>
I kill you rappers<br/>
A lot of green with a yellow complexion<br/>
Women call me the Green Bay packer<br/>
I pack the zero’s<br/>
Meaning mucho deniro<br/>
So paid, rappers is waitin’ on trades and they all get Knicked like Melo<br/>
Hello, LUDA!<br/>
Tell theses other boys double up<br/>
‘Cause I got some work all on my waist but I call it a tummy tuck<br/>
My every records jumpin’, or playin’ double dutch<br/>
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Joe Budden]</i><br/>
Let me tell this to the people not understandin’ my moxy<br/>
Animal, watch me<br/>
if you think it’s ?, stop me<br/>
But then I hit ‘em with a flow, that they can’t even copy<br/>
See, we don’t play that<br/>
Where I’m from it’s like fantasy hockey<br/>
Sup with the dog, thugs want a war<br/>
Bad jean, what you want to trade slugs with ‘em for<br/>
While you cuffin’ em more, I’m stuffin’ the jaw<br/>
Illegal for you to reworking Kevin Love on the board, dog?<br/>
You and your skills ? on my squad<br/>
I put you on a crash course in a smart car<br/>
Going speeding not relying on the brake pad<br/>
The car you still drive on the race track<br/>
So you lying bout your feelings and the Maybach?<br/>
A ghost tail for the Phantoms, face facts?<br/>
We ruin hip hop, slaughterhouse and payback<br/>
In the shape of a tatt, you done faded to black<br/>
GO…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Claret Jai]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Royce da 5'9'']</i><br/>
I went from eating top ramen to being top rhymer<br/>
Check full of commas<br/>
No regrets except for the drama<br/>
I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma<br/>
My mind in the wrong direction<br/>
Now it’s time ya bow down in ?<br/>
Writ in my honour cause bitch I’m bonker, plural<br/>
In a whip with my Ivanka, pompous? girl<br/>
She on E, feeling on me, singing on key<br/>
While I’m bumping We Are The World<br/>
Got a sniff from Britney, no he didn’t did he<br/>
“We run this town”<br/>
No he didn’t did he<br/>
I feel like tinting the glass,<br/>
You take a sip with me<br/>
She from the city of Jackson<br/>
I call her Mississippi, that was pretty witty<br/>
Demand like a black man tryna get re-elected<br/>
He ain't get it, did he?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Claret Jai]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joell Ortiz]</i><br/>
? to the pedal<br/>
Pedal to the floor<br/>
Just whippin’ it through the ghetto<br/>
Metal in the door, case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy<br/>
Referee mind state, I’m settling the score<br/>
I don’t know what ya’ll hating for<br/>
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact<br/>
I don’t know what you’re waiting for<br/>
I ain't finna say nothing, turn the bass up more til the speakers pop<br/>
I get a kick outta that, like a sneakers spot<br/>
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears<br/>
and his tongue in his ear going na-na-na-nah-naaar<br/>
Just when you think it stop na-na-na-nah-naaar<br/>
Everything I speak is hot<br/>
But don't be mad at least everything you speak is…<br/>
I can’t think of nothing nice to say, you’re not nice okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Crooked I]</i><br/>
Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur<br/>
My shit fly like I’m launching manure<br/>
Lord of the underground, God of the saw<br/>
On Hennessy black, ? to the jaw<br/>
Yeah I’m off the block<br/>
This ain't work, call me “I’m off the block”<br/>
I’m a syllable, Hannibal, killer cannibal<br/>
With a mechanical manual to deliver the flammable ammo<br/>
Lyrical and I’m off the top<br/>
Rep that West till I walk with Pac<br/>
We the 2.0 Boys, quick fricken Joe boys<br/>
New gold Rolls Royce, fall off the lot<br/>
Cock me, the only way you can stop me<br/>
I’m top seed, I pop green at my speed<br/>
So watch me, if you haven’t seen the phenomenom<br/>
I speak fast as Lamborghini’s in Ramadan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I suggest you shut it down<br/>
Pack your ‘ish and turn around<br/>
Because tonight, we run this town<br/>
So let your feet, still swiftly hit the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
We too dangerous for the World
