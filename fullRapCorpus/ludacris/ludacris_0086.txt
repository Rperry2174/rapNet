<i>[INTRO:]</i><br/>
I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Here I am, yep, I'm I'm I'm I I'm the man...word <br/>
Here I am, yep, yep, I'm the m-man...word <br/>

<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1:]</i><br/>
When Premier puts the needle on the record then I put it on blaast, <br/>
your flow is garbage, I throw it in the trash, <br/>
I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit, <br/>
rewind the verse, make the track do a back flip, <br/>
your speakers poppin' on a handstand, <br/>
they snaek dissin' niggas, throwin' little jabs like Bam-Bam, <br/>
and I'm a bad man, <br/>
they amatures like at Apollo, I wipe 'em off the stage like Sandman, <br/>
damn man, what the hell you smokin' on, <br/>
it's Ludacris I got more cheese than Prombolon, <br/>
and the chrome is home, so I'm never home alone, <br/>
and only keep friends with 2-X chromosomes, <br/>
so I command all these rappers: "Put the mic down!", <br/>
throw a grenade in your mouth "Nigga, bite down!!", <br/>
'cause I'm back with Premo on the track, <br/>
takin' it to the essence, showin' niggas how to rap <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Here I am, yep, I'm I'm I'm I I'm the man...word <br/>
Here I am, yep, yep, I'm the m-man...word <br/>
Here I am, yep, I'm the m-m-man...word <br/>

<i>[VERSE 2:]</i><br/>
Still hungry as the day I began <br/>
I heat the booth up so much the engineer caught a muthafuckin' tan, <br/>
I'm the truth, when it comes to it, <br/>
I hold Hip Hop for hostage, since 2000 I put a gun to it, <br/>
and I run through it, like a jamaican boat, <br/>
and everyday is a vacation on jamaican smoke, <br/>
charge your whole block, <br/>
talk shit, they hear the four pop, <br/>
"One, Two!" and it don't stop, <br/>
and my deliveries invaded your vicinity, Hennesy is my remedy, takin' shots like Kennedy, <br/>
and I've been a G, for a long time, <br/>
to these streets I'm connected like I'm online, <br/>
on time for whatever, <br/>
and everytime and album drop, I drop big like Voletta, <br/>
I'm ahead of the competition, they wishin' I just fade off, <br/>
my career for your life, let's trade off <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Here I am, yep, I'm I'm I'm I I'm the man...word <br/>
Here I am, yep, yep, I'm the m-man...word <br/>
Here I am, yep, I'm the m-m-man...word <br/>

<i>[VERSE 3:]</i><br/>
8 years in the game, ain't a damn thang change, <br/>
so I brought it back to one of the tracks, so where the damn thang came, <br/>
and he goin' down in history, 'cause he don't sleep, <br/>
and he the first southern rapper on a Premo beat, <br/>
I ate the kick and the snare, <br/>
the samples always taste fine, <br/>
and I shoot a hot sixteen from the baseline, <br/>
I'm on point like CP3, <br/>
and I'll be goin' down in rap as the MVP <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Here I am, yep, I'm I'm I'm I I'm the man...word <br/>
Here I am, yep, yep, I'm the m-man...word <br/>
Here I am, yep, I'm the m-m-man...word <br/>
