<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Everybody breaking, breaking Up...<br/>
Let's stay together, (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
Let's stay together Yea!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yea! tell Y'all a lil' story right quick man, LUDA!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
First the Fat Boyz break up,<br/>
Now everyday I wake up,<br/>
Somebody done call it quits,<br/>
Shit I thought Bobby and Whitney stay together forever if they made it that long,<br/>
I guess the drugs weren't that strong<br/>
And now it's Russel and Kimora even Jordan and Wanita<br/>
And to top it off Brad left Jen for Angelina!<br/>
What the hell is going on in this World?!<br/>
This just can't be! If Will and Jada can do it, then why can't we?!<br/>
Hillary is still with Bill Clinton,<br/>
How did they do it? He got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it!<br/>
Now Paul McCartney losing half of his life,<br/>
All because he got divorced from his wife,<br/>
Somebody said "it's cheaper to keep her",<br/>
But not in K-Fed's case (nope!)<br/>
'cause Britney even had to pay for K-Fed's case (Cha-Ching!) Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne<br/>
And if you broke up with your girl I know you feelin' the pain because...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everybody's breaking, breaking Up,<br/>
Let's stay together (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
Let's stay together United we Stand, divided we fall Common!<br/>
Everybody's breaking, breaking Up,<br/>
Let's stay together (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
Let's stay together United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
First it was Shaq and Kobe (yea), then Iverson and Philly (yea),<br/>
T.O. and Mcnabb (yea), even Game and 50 (yep!),<br/>
I guess sometimes you gotta let the past be the past (past),<br/>
But I'd give a hundred thou' to see Jay with Dame Dash,<br/>
B.G. with Lil' Wayne (yea!), Juvenile and Turk (yea!),<br/>
Mannie Fresh with Baby (un huh),<br/>
How can we make it work? Crunchy with 3-6 (yea!),<br/>
Diamond with Crime Mob (yea!), Lauryn Hill with the Fugees (what?!),<br/>
Remy with Terror Squad (Woo!), Lil' Kim back with C's and Snoop with More Dre,<br/>
Dre With Mo-Big Boys, CD's with Mo-Plays,<br/>
Tribes with no Quest, Salt with no Pepa,<br/>
Even the Eagles broke up and got the Fuck back together,<br/>
Selling millions of copies And getting that cash<br/>
And Raz B said "Chris Stokes was getting that Ass", I don't even understand it,<br/>
What the hell went wrong? Maybe folks will wise up and take heed to this song because...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everybody's breaking, breaking Up,<br/>
Let's stay together (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
Let's stay together United we Stand, divided we fall Common!<br/>
Everybody's breaking, breaking Up,<br/>
Let's stay together (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
Let's stay together United we Stand, divided we fall (I can't take it, Oh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
First Wu-Tang broke up, Now O.D.B. is gone,<br/>
Now I'm hearing Cam'ron don't talk to Jim Jones,<br/>
Who would've saw that Shit coming?<br/>
Certainly not me, or Tha Dogg Pound break up, or Goodie M-O-B,<br/>
then Shawnna almost jumped ship from DTP,<br/>
If Chingy left and came back<br/>
Then damn it why can't she?<br/>
We gotta think us of all for one<br/>
And one for all HIP HOP<br/>
United we stand divided we<br/>
Fall So why is?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everybody breaking, breaking Up,<br/>
Let's stay together (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
Let's stay together United we Stand, divided we fall Come on!<br/>
Everybody breaking, breaking Up,<br/>
Let's stay together (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
Let's stay together United we Stand, divided we fall Come on!<br/>
Everybody breaking, breaking up,<br/>
Let's stay together (together <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
Let's stay together United we Stand, divided we fall<br/>
<i>[faded Ending]</i>
