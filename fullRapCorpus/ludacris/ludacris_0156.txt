Georgia, Georgia<br/>
Georgia, Georgia<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
We on the grind in... Georgia<br/>
All the time, it ain't<br/>
Nothin on my mind but... Georgia<br/>
We ain't playin witcha<br/>
<br/>
Country Name<br/>
Country Slang<br/>
Fiens at the liquor store<br/>
Lac Cruisin<br/>
Crap Shootin<br/>
50 on the 10 to 4<br/>
Overcast the forecast<br/>
Shows clouds from plenty dro<br/>
And we ready for war in the state of... Georgia<br/>
Dirty Words<br/>
Dirty Birds<br/>
It's mean in the dirty south<br/>
If you ever disrespect it then we'll clean out your dirty mouth<br/>
Bulldawgs is clockin<br/>
These look out boys is hawkin<br/>
You gotta be brave in the state of... Georgia<br/>
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones<br/>
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome<br/>
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone<br/>
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of... Georgia<br/>
We some ATL thrashers<br/>
Scope your pumpkin and smasha<br/>
We'll come through your hood worse than a tsunami disaster<br/>
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit<br/>
Thats why I keep my Georgia Tech in the state of... Georgia<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
We on the grind in... Georgia<br/>
All the time, it ain't<br/>
Nothin on my mind but... Georgia<br/>
We ain't playin witcha<br/>
<br/>
I'm from the home of the neck bones, black eyed peas, turnip and collard greens<br/>
We the children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee<br/>
GA the peach state where we stay<br/>
My small city's called Albany... Georgia<br/>
Pecan country like catfish with grits<br/>
Candy yams and chitlins<br/>
Gram's homemade baked biscuits<br/>
The land of classical Caprices and Impala super sports<br/>
Ingredients in the peach cobbler called... Georgia<br/>
I love the women out in L.A.<br/>
And the shopping stores in New York<br/>
The beaches in MIA<br/>
But they ain't nothin like that GA red clay<br/>
Look on your map, we right above Florida<br/>
Next to Bama<br/>
Under the Carolinas and Tennesse you'll see... Georgia<br/>
Where Gladys Knights and the Midnight Train<br/>
The birthplace of Martin Luther King<br/>
Where ass so plump and hips are thick<br/>
Where Lac trucks sit on 26's<br/>
Know where your going or your get lost<br/>
Found on these plum trees in the south<br/>
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in... Georgia<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
We on the grind in... Georgia<br/>
All the time, it ain't<br/>
Nothin on my mind but... Georgia<br/>
We ain't playin witcha<br/>
<br/>
Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,<br/>
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on the Chevy when I'm choppin in the trap<br/>
Country as hell, dey sum warriorz, told sum to spray sumthan the same shape as Florida,<br/>
Lookin for me boy, ya find me, outta Dougherty County in a small city call'd Albany... Georgia<br/>
Where dey use to call us sum bamas,<br/>
An now dey jockin da grammar<br/>
Watch ya mouf unless you out foe sum mannar,<br/>
Bunch of hustlaz run on every corna like the Waffle house in Atlanta<br/>
R.I.P Camoflauge out in Savannah... Georgia<br/>
Now u might come foe vacachun,<br/>
Leave on probachun<br/>
Home of da strip club,<br/>
Known foe da thyck gulz<br/>
Where da chickz put tipz in da tip cup,<br/>
Of thyck chick in a thong wit a big butt<br/>
When it gettin on, won't b cheap when it on like peachtree,<br/>
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in... Georgia<br/>
When you see dem confederate flagz ya know wut it iz,<br/>
Ya folkz pick cotton here datz y we call it da field<br/>
I got a Chevrolet on 26'zzz,<br/>
I'm frum GA.. .GA... Georgia<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
We on the grind in... Georgia<br/>
All the time, it ain't<br/>
Nothin on my mind but... Georgia<br/>
We ain't playin witcha
