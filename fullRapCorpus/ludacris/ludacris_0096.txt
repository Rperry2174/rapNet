<i>[Ludacris - Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Welcome to my little sanctuary<br/>
you've been looking so good all day<br/>
and you really got a nigga pretty anxious baby<br/>
better call your boss tell him that your daddy's home<br/>
take a couple days off<br/>
and take it off and leave nothing but your T-shirts and your panties on<br/>
feeling high but I'm hung real low looking sorta like a tripod,<br/>
so power down your cell phone and power up your iPod<br/>
power down your inhibitions and power up your inner freak<br/>
(yes... fuck)<br/>
it's the only words that you finna speak<br/>
its about to get real x-rated<br/>
can you handle what I'm 'bout to do<br/>
but enough about me let me think<br/>
should I be worrying about if I can handle you<br/>
damn right I'ma get that thing and I'ma put my name on it<br/>
all night I'ma whip that thing, all state better put a claim on it<br/>
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up<br/>
you could be my fire cracker, my tongue gon spark you up<br/>
get ready for blast off, waterfalls gon splash off<br/>
you might lose around 4 or 5 pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Welcome to my sex room<br/>
where your body meets my body<br/>
its our private afterparty<br/>
if you want it girl I got it in my sex room<br/>
candles and a pole sets your body to your soul<br/>
from the bed down to the floor, sex room<br/>
mirrors in the head board, even got a camcord<br/>
baby won't you dance in my sex room<br/>
Welcome to my sex room<br/>
where your body meets my body<br/>
its a private afterparty<br/>
if you want it girl I got it<br/>
in my sex room<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Let the candles burn, Imma turn these lights down<br/>
and when your body gets hot, it'll get you licked up and iced down<br/>
nipples hard as rocks, lips as soft as cotton<br/>
your the apple of my eye, and I got you spoiled rotten<br/>
I'mma get my video camera, lets make a movie baby<br/>
you the star so as soon as I press record you got's to do me baby<br/>
you can stare all in the mirror, take a pic at how good you looking<br/>
Imma have your body smoking, take a look at what Luda's cooking<br/>
my arm underneath your leg leg<br/>
or behind your head is how I gots to get ya<br/>
right hand left hand all red in the bed like we've been playing twister<br/>
now I've got you tangled up and you caught all in my web<br/>
should I let you loose nah<br/>
I think I'll get the blindfold instead<br/>
you better get a couple towels baby<br/>
cos we about to slip and slide<br/>
you don't ever need a horse or saddle<br/>
I'mma give you this dick to ride<br/>
I'mma grant your every wish and fulfill your fantasy<br/>
aint nobody else allowed in the sex room<br/>
it's only you and me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
