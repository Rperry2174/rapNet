<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Check 1, 2 speak into the microphone<br/>
Tell that bitch to speak into the microphone<br/>

Now work it work it, cause practice make perfect, OK<br/>
Now work it work it, cause practice make perfect, OK<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
I love it when she do it, she do it how I like it<br/>
See the party at the studio and you just got invited<br/>
She the truth up in the booth<br/>
I love it when she spits them verses<br/>
When she finish with that mic<br/>
It make me want to buy some purses<br/>
Got so many instrumentals<br/>
I hope she never stop it<br/>
And this microphone's expensive<br/>
So I hope she never drop it<br/>
I beat it like a drum, I tap it like some snares<br/>
And she almost blew her speakers<br/>
But that bitch don't really care<br/>
She a top notch freak<br/>
I like the way she work it<br/>
She be choking on that chicken<br/>
And she know just how to jerk it<br/>
Put some spice up in your life<br/>
So I whispered in her ear<br/>
And told her go and grab that mic<br/>
You'll be the artist of the year<br/>
And I'm like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Check 1, 2<br/>
Speak into the microphone<br/>
Tell that bitch to speak into the microphone<br/>
Check 1, 2<br/>
Speak into the microphone<br/>
Tell that bitch to speak into the microphone<br/>
Now work it, work it cause practice make perfect, OK<br/>
Now work it, work it cause practice make perfect, OK<br/>
Now work it, work it cause practice make perfect, OK<br/>
Now work it, work it cause practice make perfect, OK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ludacris]</i><br/>
I need her in my life<br/>
She always come in handy<br/>
And she got that type of skills<br/>
That make you think she won a Grammy<br/>
I was almost nominated<br/>
I always contemplate it<br/>
If she was on the billboard top 100<br/>
Then that bitch will dominate it<br/>
Cause she grab that mic and go to work<br/>
Spit that verse I go berserk<br/>
Booth so hot take off your shirt<br/>
Grab that drink, roll up the purp<br/>
We wasted in the studio<br/>
Making a movie yo, with a boogie ho<br/>
Just a little gangster paradise we like Coolio<br/>
I'm faded cause I think I just discovered a star<br/>
And you my best kept secret they don't know who your are<br/>
I keep her close and tell her baby don't be going to far<br/>
Cause She know when to grab that microphone<br/>
Whether she be in the booth or the car<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
She goin' make me sign her to a record deal<br/>
Hit the store and buy her some Giuseppe heels<br/>
She be on that mic so long she out of breath<br/>
Put her in the booth and work her half to death<br/>
She goin' make me sign her to a record deal<br/>
Hit the store and buy her some Giuseppe heels<br/>
She be on that mic so long she out of breath<br/>
Put her in the booth and work her half to death<br/>
<br/>
