She proud of it, other women gotta really acknowledge it<br/>
Cause when she hit that stripper pole, her booty swallow it<br/>
So go girl, go get it, go girl, go kill it<br/>
See if your girl with my girl<br/>
Your girl gonna get the business<br/>
We gon take a sip of that potion<br/>
Put some things in motion, we gone slice hood, and dice hood<br/>
And bust the bitch wide open cause its<br/>

<br/>
That girl hella bad, I wanna pop hella tags<br/>
The way that booty propels it needs a hella pad<br/>
Or a landin strip , they don't need to panic trick<br/>
Drop that apple bottle right down on my banana clip<br/>
I cock and aim and shoot it<br/>
So insane how you move it, love it how you drop it like it's hot<br/>
Then take a little time off and just cool it<br/>
Cause it needs some time to breathe<br/>
Gonna give it a squeeze, cause them lips, hips and thighs<br/>
And even them double D's<br/>
<br/>
Jingalin', jingalin', jingalin', she jingalin'<br/>
Jingalin', jingalin', jingalin', ooh she jingalin'<br/>
Jingalin', jingalin', jingalin', go head, she jingalin'<br/>
Jingalin', jingalin', jingalin', go head, she jingalin'<br/>

Go head baby, go head baby, do that shit, now jiggle<br/>
Go head baby, go head baby, do that shit, now jiggle<br/>
Go head baby, go head baby, jiggle it, now that do that shit<br/>
