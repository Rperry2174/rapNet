<i>[intro I-20]</i><br/>
What the fuck's up!<br/>
DTP in this mother fucker<br/>
And for all ya'll that don't like it<br/>
Do one thing, get the fuck back<br/>
'Cause all my niggas iz ready<br/>
Luda, 20, Fate, Shawna<br/>
Let's show these mutha fuckers how we disturb the peace<br/>
Get the fuck back, bitch<br/>
<i>[shooting and screaming in the background]</i><br/>

Fuck That!<br/>

<br/>
Bronson, mutha fucker, give me more than three feet<br/>
DTP in the club, we comin' more than three deep<br/>
Your whole crew is weak and my squad is real cash getters<br/>
Stayin' more to crunk, our shit bump like bad clippers<br/>
How many try to hustle with Dealer then went broke<br/>
Infamous, I'm a value meal, I come with the coke<br/>
I gotta enough guns for beef, if you want it that way<br/>
I'll push your wig back like finger waves or bad toupee<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I lick a load of you niggaz, leave kids in the hallways<br/>
Catch 'em at they locka (hoo-ahh, blocka blocka)(gun shots)<br/>
See 'em on Broadway and tap they ass<br/>
Catch 'em in the swimming pool and overlap they ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fate]</i><br/>
I'm from the southside, College Park<br/>
G Road, niggas gone<br/>
Ride when the beef starts<br/>
Don't hold back, let the heat spark<br/>
One's through his vest, one's through his chest<br/>
Sleepy hollows put the niggas to rest, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Fuck That!<br/>
Get the fuck back!<br/>
Luda make your skull crack<br/>
Tuck that<br/>
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsack<br/>
Cuff that<br/>
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that<br/>
What's that<br/>
People gon' die tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawna]</i><br/>
Fuck That!<br/>
Get the fuck back!<br/>
Shaw make your skull crack<br/>
Tuck that<br/>
Bitch, your whole town better love that<br/>
Cuff that<br/>
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that<br/>
What's that<br/>
People gon' die tonight<br/>
<br/>
What you know about projects, hoes, and murda<br/>
whole lotta game, whole lotta keys and burners<br/>
Whole lotta dope fiends, trying to scheme the workers<br/>
Whole lotta feds, got them niggas scared to surface<br/>
Type of bitch that got the brown in my sock<br/>
Find me on tha block tryin' to cop a piece of the crop<br/>
Watch me, pull up on me real sweet in a drop<br/>
But if you fuckin' with my paper, feel the heat from the glock, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
We pop bottles, bottles,<br/>
right over you head, niggas<br/>
Put nozzles, nozzles<br/>
Right over your leg, niggas<br/>
Our motto, motto<br/>
Is kill 'em instead, niggas<br/>
We make 'em loose weight, when we Jenny Craig, niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[I-20]</i><br/>
All of ya'll is half nice, half thugs, and half assed<br/>
The only time Im goin' half, is half on a half<br/>
But I use a full clip, cuz I'm a full fledged killa<br/>
Part-time MC, full-time drug dealer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Fuck That!<br/>
Get the fuck back!<br/>
Luda make your skull crack<br/>
Tuck that<br/>
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsack<br/>
Cuff that<br/>
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that<br/>
What's that<br/>
People gon' die tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fate]</i><br/>
Fuck That!<br/>
Get the fuck back!<br/>
Fate make your skull crack<br/>
Tuck that<br/>
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsacks<br/>
Cuff that<br/>
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that<br/>
What's that<br/>
People gon' die tonight<br/>
<br/>
We the filthy niggas from the South, A-Town represent us<br/>
Strong armin' motherfuckers, like a Russian sickle<br/>
You got issues with us talkin' shit on mixed tapes<br/>
Ill catch you at a show and beat you with a mix tape<br/>
You best pump brakes, 'fore I pump shells and blood oze<br/>
I leave niggas like burps (burp), excuse<br/>
Just keep on pissin me off, like a week kidney<br/>
And you will find your family reading your obituary<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
These people tryin' to scrub the red off<br/>
Stains they don't get off<br/>
They wanted to bring the pain, so this thang 'bout to set off<br/>
Barretas for getting cheddar, you're better off dead off<br/>
Yes, you can do it, cut his fuckin head off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawna]</i><br/>
I got a letter from the government, the other day<br/>
They told me that the bitches caught a shipment of my yay<br/>
They on their way, three minutes to get the k<br/>
Two minutes to get the weight, one minute and imma spray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Fuck That!<br/>
Get the fuck back!<br/>
We make your skull crack<br/>
Tuck that<br/>
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsack<br/>
Cuff that<br/>
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that<br/>
What's that<br/>
People gon' die tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawna]</i><br/>
Fuck That!<br/>
Get the fuck back!<br/>
We make your skull crack<br/>
Tuck that<br/>
Bitch, your whole town better love that<br/>
Cuff that<br/>
Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that<br/>
What's that<br/>
People gon' die tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 2x - 1st time Ludacris, 2nd time Fate]</i><br/>
Bang bang kill a man let his brains hang<br/>
And when I'm in the court, plead guilty insane<br/>
They put me in a ward, imma have to maintain<br/>
But when I hit bricks won't a damn thing change
