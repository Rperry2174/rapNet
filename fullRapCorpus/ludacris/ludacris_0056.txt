<i>[Chorus 4X]</i><br/>
In this life one thing counts<br/>
In the bank, large amounts<br/>
<i>[Luda speaks in the background]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Now everybody wants a piece of my pocket<br/>
And it don't help when I'm screaming on these records that I'm rich<br/>
Calling people from my number now I block it <br/>
Cuz there's nothing worse then getting haunted by a stockin' ass bitch (oh yeah)<br/>
Cuz good game I'm talkin' and yet you're so true some women will have you feeling blue like cris<br/>
I lay my feet upon the path and now I'm walkin'<br/>
I spread my wealth out or someone close will have me layin' in a ditch<br/>
I have my friends steal from me<br/>
Snatch my credit card and my wallet hit the town and leave outstanding bills for me<br/>
They say I got the cash for it and I can't recall one single member of my family that never<br/>
asked for it<br/>
They've been kicking down doors and bustin' out flows <br/>
They can't get me on the phone so they surprise me at my show<br/>
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it<br/>
All I hear "common cuss you know I'm good for it" (man)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Now don't get me wrong cuz being rich is such a beautiful thing<br/>
But more money, more problems people drive me insane<br/>
Now giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee<br/>
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me<br/>
Put them in position and make their wishes come...true<br/>
So they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night<br/>
Given a million dollars, what you gone...do?<br/>
Wrap your life for your kids-kids or would you spend it over night?<br/>
Now see me I do both I got unlimited funds <br/>
My daughters life was set before her stankin' butt turned one  <br/>
And it don't help that I got 4 or 5 retirement funds<br/>
So if I choose before I'm 30 I can lay in the sun<br/>
My dividends can show and prove the real meaning of fun<br/>
That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun<br/>
The IRS `ll never sweat me or even put up a fight<br/>
Cuz I'm sure I pay more in taxes then you made in your life<br/>
Because...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Now women these days don't want a man without a nice pay check<br/>
So we splurge even though our lives ain't in right place yet   <br/>
Buying jewellery and some cars just to impress these whores<br/>
Meanwhile your child's poor like "daddy why you left me for?"<br/>
Yeah but it all comes back that's why I named my daughter Karma (yup)<br/>
Who teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter<br/>
I sweep her off her feet cuz I'm her knight in shining armour <br/>
And I have your fucking head if anybody tries to harm her<br/>
Got to teach her about the game that most of us niggaz are spitin?<br/>
About these scandalous ass women that get money thru gifts<br/>
They suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash<br/>
Or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas<br/>
So that brand new ride pick up our friends<br/>
While you're slippin` she slides<br/>
Drop top Benz gold diggers inside<br/>
Crazy what the world will do for money<br/>
Thinking that everything will be alright<br/>
Cuz...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus repeat till end]</i>
