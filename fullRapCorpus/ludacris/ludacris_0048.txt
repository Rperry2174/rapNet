<i>[dice rolling]</i><br/>
<i>[DMX]</i> Grrrrrrrr..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Ludacris]</i> + (DMX)<br/>
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)<br/>
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)<br/>
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)<br/>
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one<br/>
to step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game<br/>
Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks<br/>
Bustin dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps<br/>
We shootin pool at the Luda-plex; I slap a hundred on the table<br/>
just to see if any fools wanna do it next<br/>
I got games galore, I got game for sure<br/>
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)<br/>
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks<br/>
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)<br/>
And we can 'bout anything that you wanna do<br/>
But come up short and OH THE THANGS that the gun'll do<br/>
Throw in the towel cause I'm makin 'em sweat<br/>
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet<br/>
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some<br/>
You know the phrase - scared money don't make none!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em<br/>
Somebody tell my fam I got a gamblin problem<br/>
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's<br/>
drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowin steam<br/>
Countin green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal<br/>
all my people bring the strength to the block<br/>
Yessir, I thought you knew it, we loco<br/>
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's gon' do it<br/>
It's people livin they LIFE comin up off change<br/>
And hustlers payin they bills comin up off games<br/>
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks<br/>
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six<br/>
Then walk away with a clean slate; catch me out in A.C.<br/>
Callin yo' bluff with Puff eatin cheesecake<br/>
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers<br/>
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips<br/>
Breakin the whole casino and doin backflips, man<br/>
Cameras eyein us, sidebetters tryin us<br/>
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buyin us<br/>
Tryin to get me off my grind, but it won't work<br/>
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt<br/>
I'm still breakin 'em, and dice still shakin 'em<br/>
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i>
