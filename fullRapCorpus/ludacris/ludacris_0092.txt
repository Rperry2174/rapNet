<i>[Ludacris - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hahaha, LUDA!<br/>
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could - Face down - {ASS UP!}<br/>
The top of yo' booty jigglin outcho' jeans, baby pull yo' pants up!<br/>
I like it when I see you do it, better than I've ever seen I done befo'<br/>
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground, but HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO?<br/>
Lower, than yo', mama's, ever, seen it, in her, life-time<br/>
Never, would of i-magined it, not even in her right mind<br/>
Practice in front of that mirror, now you, doin it, on the dance flo'<br/>
Mad 'cause I can't get wit you, "Chick, just show me how to dance" {OHH!!!}<br/>
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up kinda like a playa do<br/>
But if you come to the crib, then I'll might show you girls a thang or two<br/>
Yeah, I think you a superstar, wit a ass like that you GOTTA blow<br/>
Befo' you make it big, there’s just one thing that I gotta know<br/>

<i>[Interlude: sped-up Chuck D. sample]</i><br/>

<i>[Ludacris - Verse 2]</i><br/>
I be like knick, knack, patty, wack <br/>
Oh, where my kitty cat? Give a dog a bone<br/>
How many licks does it take 'til I get <br/>
to the center and let a realla nigga take you home?<br/>
I can make this show, {STOP} soon as he hear this fo', {POP}<br/>
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo', {BLOCK}<br/>
(OHHH!!!) Put the needle on the record <br/>
and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini<br/>
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV<br/>
(Oh!!) 'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla) <br/>
and the caramel (and the caramel)<br/>
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate),<br/>
I know that very well (I know that very well)<br/>
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us<br/>
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces (OH!!)<br/>
'Cause I think you a superstar, wit a ass like that you GOTTA blow<br/>
Befo' you make it big, there’s just one thing that I gotta knoooooow...<br/>

<i>[Luda - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it<br/>
Don’t, stop - {GET IT, GET IT}<br/>
Put it in reverse just to back it up<br/>
Let me put some Luda in it<br/>
Show me whatchu workin with, I’ll show you some of this bank, roll<br/>
Yeah you a superstar, there's just one thing I gotta know<br/>
So...<br/>
