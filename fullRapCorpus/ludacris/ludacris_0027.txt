It's two a.m. in the morning and it uhh..<br/>
light showers and you're probably hookin up with that girl<br/>
that's been, two-wayin you all week.  Her baby daddy's out <br/>
of town so uhh, you can fuck around.  It's okay to check in <br/>
that Motel 6.  $59.95, not a cent more, for that dirty-ass ho.<br/>
Yeah.  Stop by that convenience store and pick up them rubbers - <br/>
magnum I hope.  This is Phazon Love and uhh, I love hoes.<br/>
I just don't pay 'em!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Jagged Edge]</i><br/>
Cut up!  Know we like that, get that cut up<br/>
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em<br/>
Get that cut up!  Oh-whooooooo, cut up<br/>
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm kinda hopin that maybe you wanna kick it in the L.A.C.<br/>
So later on we'll be rollin<br/>
Drop-tops I'm hittin yo' hot spots I'm top notch<br/>
My niggaz never listen but I told 'em<br/>
When I catch you at the game runnin game at the A.U.C.<br/>
that later on we'd be bonin<br/>
Fat cats I'm ready to tap that so back that<br/>
No wonder why you wakin up up swollen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
I'm feelin you Luda', smokin my buddha, coochie recruiter<br/>
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast<br/>
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash<br/>
on the back and leave it drippin down the crack of her ass<br/>
Call me Mr. Magillicuddy, chasin booty soft as silly puddy<br/>
Killin for money, still a thug get bump; from some pokin<br/>
and locomotion hittin bunnies, for threesome getcha buddy<br/>
When I'm feelin scummy I love to cut<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Tan skin so, butter soft I'm rippin the buttons off yo' - BLOUSE<br/>
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' - HOUSE<br/>
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down - SOUTH<br/>
Hot fellatio, hot jalapenos holla while they in yo' - MOUTH<br/>
So we love that k-k-k-k<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
Now I got the feelin we can cut the hell out each other<br/>
And I hope we be the same thang - freaks<br/>
We can get the mattress goin eh-err, eh-err<br/>
Handlin business while I bang bang - skeet<br/>
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again<br/>
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen flo' or the outdoors<br/>
The pieces from the East is the shit<br/>
and the flesh in the West is the best<br/>
but Twista love them Chicago and South hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Come up out yo', negligee, freak 'em on a regular day<br/>
Cum six times - but it's seven today<br/>
Ludacris in the back of your Chev-e-rolet<br/>
Ahh, ahh!  What's my name?<br/>
So magical I come and touch the game<br/>
You motherfuckers really lust to gain<br/>
Nothin but hatin and a look of disgust<br/>
So it's must, stay "Adrenaline Rush"<br/>
Wonderin why they don't be bustin the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
I'm clutchin my thang;<br/>
stuffin in it, strokin it down, beat the stuff up<br/>
Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it<br/>
She give me the booty I'm breakin it off<br/>
I can tell a style by the way that she walk<br/>
Fatty flickin like it was dubs on it<br/>
Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels<br/>
Pullin rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag<br/>
Wanna smoke 'dro I got a bag, take a proper drag befo' I tap it<br/>
I love the chicks that got a lotta ass, so we love that k-k-k-k<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Bubble, bubble bubbles is in the bathtub<br/>
Makin you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs<br/>
It's killin me thinkin about the bottles that pop<br/>
The models that swallow willin, up under my pillow stayin strapped up<br/>
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape<br/>
So give me the rope you gettin wrapped up<br/>
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity<br/>
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin slapped up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread<br/>
Long as I can still grab her legs, and push 'em up by her head<br/>
How I dip up in it we can make a video<br/>
but I got the radio bumpin Jagged Edge by the bed<br/>
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy<br/>
come on and dip up through the hideout with Twist'<br/>
But after we do what we gon' do getcha purse and get together<br/>
because now you gots to ride out - bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Oh 'Cris, can you - do it again, that's what they askin me<br/>
Hit skins, causin catastrophes<br/>
Get pinned, by me and my family<br/>
Sip gin, fulfillin yo' fantasies<br/>
In yo condition I'm wishin you'll take a lickin<br/>
and keep on tickin from thicker thighs<br/>
Finger lickin never get sick and tired, just take a look in her eyes<br/>
and you can tell she's a figure five, so we love that k-k-k-k<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jagged Edge - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Cut up, gettin brains, in the Range<br/>
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs<br/>
I like it when you let me try, anythang<br/>
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time<br/>
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl<br/>
<br/>
I come from the eighth planet in the 19th galaxy,<br/>
where the royal penis is clean, yo' majesty.  Can it be, <br/>
Sheila E, Appalonia, Vanity, all mad at me?  I'm the <br/>
Prince dick of insanity.  I'm good lovin, body-rockin, <br/>
knockin boots all night long, we not stoppin.<br/>
I don't care if the kids watchin, I stir it like motherfuckin <br/>
coffee and brown sugar.  Girls dem sugar.  World class lover.<br/>
Kama sutra, porno music producer.  Tallywhacker is a rock hard<br/>
storm trooper with a purple helmet, made for crushin<br/>
pink cookies.  Goonie goo-goo, we cut bigfoots and wookies;<br/>
and fat women, because they need love too.<br/>
So go on big girl, whatchu gon' do?
