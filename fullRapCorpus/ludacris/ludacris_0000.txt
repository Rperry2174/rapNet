<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
- Yeah come see this nigga<br/>
come see this ol' light-skinned motherfucker<br/>
I seen him and I'm addicted<br/>
Disturbin Tha Piece is the click<br/>
Please tell these fake-ass niggaz who you are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I be dat nigga named Luda'<br/>
Alert Alert! It's the ATLlien intruder<br/>
College Park waterboy, spit in the c-cooler<br/>
I +Jam+ till they +Def+, they call me Slick Dick Da Ruler<br/>
Women indeed, keep ya eyes closed<br/>
Keep yo' eyes closed, 'bow blows, come on out dem clothes hos<br/>
Low pros, low bows, watch out for the po-po<br/>
And I chose, to be dat numba one contender<br/>
Southern offender, fuckin up ya whole agenda<br/>
When I walk you try to run, when I run you try to hide<br/>
You skate at the snap of my fingers call me +Golden Glide+<br/>
Its you and I, Do or Die, who am I?<br/>
I got a pocket full of +Family Stone+, cats think I'm +Sly+<br/>
Ohh why try?  You one of dem niggaz that like to cheat death<br/>
And I'm one of dem niggaz<br/>
that rip out Excursions til there's no seats left<br/>
You shit out wheat chex, and fart out deep breaths<br/>
While we toss darts at the bottom of y'all v-necks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
- Who, that nigga 'Cris?<br/>
Aw dat nigga is aight<br/>
Dat nigga can't fuck wit me though!<br/>
Let me get on the mic<br/>
Nigga, who the fuck are you nigga?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I be dat nigga Bronze Bridges<br/>
Playaz wanna ball but go on strike cause of my pitches<br/>
They think I want they be-itches<br/>
But I don't want no pigeons yet pigeons can scrub my dishes<br/>
And y'all don't want no scrubs til y'all pull out y'all extensions<br/>
Y'all in school detention that'll neva come out<br/>
Man I'll cut yo achilles tendon and put a sock in yo' mouth<br/>
Cause we da shit in the South, they know what I'm talkin bout<br/>
You see we Jack and we Daniels, y'all Earl and Ralph<br/>
4-Ize twirl it out, lick it dry and tend it to flames<br/>
Not even Joshua can come to +War+ wit dese +Games+<br/>
These bitch niggaz is lame and come down wit da reigns<br/>
You all wet behind the ears but its a drought in ya brain<br/>
and that's the simple and plain mayne, three w dot shhhh<br/>
(Man that dude Luder's got some hotter than hot shhh)<br/>
Well sh-sh-sh-shut the fuck up<br/>
Before you get cu-cu-cut-cut the fuck up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
- Hold on man, hold on lil buddy<br/>
Y'all talkin bout shorty man?<br/>
Shorty up at da radio station?<br/>
Shorty be poppin man?<br/>
Let the name be known who y'all talkin bout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i> <br/>
I be dat nigga da +Lova Lova+<br/>
I'm nastier than thinkin about yo' parents sex each other<br/>
No glove, no love, betta tell yo' dick to run for cover<br/>
So when lightnin strikes, you can be safe on a few rubbers<br/>
if you know what I mean!<br/>
Not everybody's Mr and Mrs. Clean<br/>
Some get burnt like Freddie Kruger, sweat dreams<br/>
Girls "backin dey ass up" now they +400 Degreez+, ha<br/>
Hot girl, tryin to give to niggaz up on the block girl<br/>
Have you screamin "STOP GIRL!"<br/>
I rock worlds with my nine inch Louisville slugga<br/>
Still wonder why they call me Lova Lova?<br/>
Self-explanitorium, ass-valedictorian<br/>
I bring 'em "Back to the Future" like a '85 Delorean<br/>
The Luda drug emporium, ON the counter prescriptions<br/>
You like my diction and my doctor/nurse convention<br/>
I place the stethoscope quite close to yo tittie<br/>
and have yo butt checks Red-man like Uncle Quilly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
See me, see me ha ha ha<br/>
CEO, D.T.P.<br/>
Infamous 2-0, Fate Forsta<br/>
4-ize-zy, Shondrez-zy on da beat<br/>
Playa Circle to ya boy, College Park nigga<br/>
Virgo nigga, what wha?<br/>
ahh ahh ahh....
