<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Maaaaaaaaan, get out my way and watch out as I come through<br/>
Bustin' in your line, crackin' helmets in two<br/>
I bring the pain, so what'cha gone do?<br/>
Stand there and just get shook out your shoes<br/>
So clean out your locker, I'm out to get'cha<br/>
Cuz I just popped ya, you can't take the pressure<br/>
You might as well quit, cuz you just can't last<br/>
Madden two thou put your face in the grass<br/>
And your spine in the DIRT, so put on a SKIRT<br/>
If you step on the field and don't wanna get HURT<br/>
Just bruised and beaten, all black and blue<br/>
And it's been like that since Madden '92<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
You better come harder than hard, rougher than rough<br/>
Put up your guard, get ready to crush<br/>
It's thangs on this field that you just can't change<br/>
E.A. Sports, it's in the game, what'cha want?<br/>
(The rock in the palm of my hands!!!)<br/>
What'cha got? (I got John Madden!!!!)<br/>
What'cha want? <br/>
(The rock in the palm of my hands!!!)<br/>
What'cha got? (I got John Madden!!!!)<br/>
What'cha want?<br/>
(The rock in the palm of my hands!!!)<br/>
What'cha got? (I got John Madden!!!!)<br/>
What'cha want?<br/>
(The rock in the palm of my hands!!!)<br/>
What'cha got? (I got John Madden!!!!)<br/>
Feel the power
