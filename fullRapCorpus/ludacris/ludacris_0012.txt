<i>[Ludacris - Verse One]</i><br/>
I be that nigga named Ludi<br/>
a k a L-O-V-A L-O-V-A<br/>
Fuck that shit<br/>
Nigga what you wan say one time<br/>
Southside let's ride (say what)<br/>
And if you love what you do, do what you feel<br/>
Then I know you gonna mark my words<br/>
Yall drop shit like birds<br/>
Then it's about the time for yo ass to get served<br/>
Just lay it on down<br/>
Just lay it on down <br/>
While we relax to the tight raps<br/>
And the phat tracks<br/>
That that nigga Timbaland put down<br/>
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit<br/>
Don't have no time for the patient<br/>
Cuz I got more dick than a lil' bit<br/>
And time flies, when I'm havin' fun<br/>
I can make a hoe get like Forrest Gump and just "run baby run"<br/>
I guess that they can't handle this<br/>
Brothers just to scandalous<br/>
If you don't wanna get freaked<br/>
then get out my way like an ambulance (say what)<br/>
Gitty up gitty up ride up on the real, let death to the fake<br/>
And tell you boyfriend just to chill, don't playa hate<br/>
Kick back relax, and just take off yo shoes<br/>
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh) <br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland (Crowds) - CHORUS]</i><br/>
Let me touch it (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it (let me grab it)<br/>
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)<br/>
Let me touch it (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it (let me grab it)<br/>
That-that rabbit (ohhh, c'mon)<br/>
Let me touch it (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it (let me grab it)<br/>
Fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)<br/>
Let me touch it (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it (let me grab it)<br/>
That-that fat rabbit (uh oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris - Verse Two]</i><br/>
Fatter than fat facts like a dove sack<br/>
Showin' them where that love's at<br/>
So open up your eyes and get a surprise like in CrackerJacks<br/>
Punan' Don happy<br/>
Givin' up that nappy dug out<br/>
Get the cut up, then I cut out<br/>
Why you standin there wit yo' butt out (whoo)<br/>
And it's always in the back of my mind<br/>
Wherever the place, whenever the time<br/>
Even in College Park, after dark, I'ma get my sunshine<br/>
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya<br/>
Beginner, give me a thigh, breast, and wing like Ms. Winner<br/>
And let dinner be served<br/>
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder<br/>
and put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter<br/>
The wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya<br/>
Gotta have rabbit like that cheddar<br/>
So I can freak ya like I just met ya<br/>
Hot like a sauna, get comfy like in a Cadillac<br/>
Nick nack paddy wack give a dog a bone Jack<br/>
Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes<br/>
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh) <br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland (Crowds) - CHORUS TWO]</i><br/>
Let me touch it (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it (let me grab it)<br/>
That fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)<br/>
Let me touch it (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)<br/>
That-that rabbit, girl (ohhh, c'mon)<br/>
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)<br/>
Fat rabbit, girl (fat rabbit, fat rabbit)<br/>
Let me touch it, girl (let me touch it)<br/>
Let me feel it, girl (let me feel it)<br/>
Let me grab it, girl (let me grab it)<br/>
That-that fat rabbit, girl  (uh oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yo' love is supa-cala-fragalistic<br/>
You don't know how bad I missed it<br/>
If it broke then don't fix it<br/>
Yo stuff is butta like a biscuit<br/>
Reminisce like Mary<br/>
I gotta pop that cherry<br/>
Kinda like that coochie<br/>
You wanna be my hoochie<br/>
Better than my advesary<br/>
Don't be so scary<br/>
I, never thought that you could act up<br/>
Make a nigga wanna back up<br/>
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up<br/>
So we can slip and slide<br/>
Make you wanna dip and dive<br/>
Trippin' while we rip and ride<br/>
Til I get to the coming side<br/>
Got you where I want yo ass<br/>
In the case of an emergency, break the glass<br/>
Keep yo eyes on the President, erase the past<br/>
We be happy if we had more blunts to pass<br/>
Get done up and run up<br/>
And the guts of yo butt don't shake like they used to<br/>
I wake 'em up like a rooster<br/>
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo rooster<br/>
No worry, no hurry<br/>
No pain, no gain<br/>
Keep yo eyes on strain<br/>
Cuz ain't a damn thing changed<br/>
Kick back, relax and take off yo shoes<br/>
Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh) <br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat CHORUS TWO]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Crowds]</i> <br/>
Let me touch it, let me touch it<br/>
Let me feel it, let me feel it<br/>
Let me grab it, let me grab it<br/>
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit<br/>
<i>[repeat x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland]</i><br/>
Wha, uh huh<br/>
Yea<br/>
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me<br/>
East Coast, feel me<br/>
West Coast, feel me<br/>
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me<br/>
East Coast, feel me<br/>
West Coast, feel me<br/>
Dirty South, (uh huh) can y'all really feel me<br/>
East Coast, feel me<br/>
West Coast
