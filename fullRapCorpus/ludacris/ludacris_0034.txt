<i>[Ludacris + (Sandy Coffee)]</i><br/>
Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Say it (make love to me)<br/>
Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! What? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Say it (make love to me)<br/>
Ohhhh! Ohhhh! Ohhhh! What? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
I'm bout to throw some game, they both one and the same<br/>
Cupid's the one to blame - say it (make love to me)<br/>
I'm bout to shed some light, cause each and every night<br/>
You gotta do it right - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
They want it nice and slow, kiss 'em from head to toe<br/>
Relax and let it go - say it (make love to me)<br/>
They want it now and fast, grabbin and smackin ass<br/>
You gotta make it last - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
Together holdin hands, you out there spendin grands<br/>
And makin family plans - say it (make love to me)<br/>
Don't have to straighten facts, don't want no strings attached<br/>
Just scratches on your BACK - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
Ex's ain't actin right, and you so glad to fight<br/>
Dinner's by candlelight - say it (make love to me)<br/>
She got a nigga whipped, down to ya fingertips<br/>
Tryin that freaky shit - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
Turn on some Babyface, just for your lady's sake<br/>
You call her babycakes - say it (make love to me)<br/>
Know how to mack a broad, she's on your sack and balls<br/>
You call her Jabberjaws - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
You bout to buy a ring, she needs the finer things<br/>
Gucci designer frames - say it (make love to me)<br/>
Purchase a nasty flick, wrap up and tie her quick<br/>
Know how to drive a stick - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
You both unite as one, you the moon and she's your sun<br/>
Your heart's a beating drum - say it (make love to me)<br/>
You better not of came, she want to feel the pain<br/>
Then hear her scream your name - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
Follow this DICK-tionary, you're both some visionaries<br/>
Then do it missionary - say it (make love to me)<br/>
I hear 'em call da wild, and do it all the while<br/>
Doggy and FROGGY style - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
You in between the sheets, lickin and eatin sweets<br/>
And what you find you keep - say it (make love to me)<br/>
You do it standin up, orgasms hand 'em up<br/>
Y'all just don't GIVE A FUCK - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
You wanna tell the world, cause she's your favorite girl<br/>
Your diamond and your pearl - say it (make love to me)<br/>
Nobody has to know, just keep it on the low<br/>
And meet 'em right at fo' - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
Nothin but fights and fussin, plus there's a lot of cussin<br/>
Just grab ahold of SOMETHIN - say it (make love to me)<br/>
Y'all do that BAD stuff, she like it rammed up<br/>
Ropes and HANDCUFFS - what? (fuck, meee!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
