<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash<br/>
Just seen a big ol' ass, it's Saturday<br/>
Sticky, icky, icky, icky<br/>
Sticky, icky, icky, icky<br/>
System on blast, cops just pass<br/>
Just seen a big ol' ass, it's Saturday<br/>
Sticky, icky, icky, icky<br/>
Sticky, icky, icky, icky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Grease don't pop on the stove no more, moved on up<br/>
double shot Hennesey fill my cup<br/>
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck<br/>
Should I wild out, WHAT THE FUCK?!<br/>
Act like my rims ain't clean<br/>
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?<br/>
Haters get sprayed like aftro-sheen<br/>
but they don't never really wanna pop them thangs<br/>
Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go<br/>
and I stop at a light, pull off so slow<br/>
but I'm out for the night, so pass that dro<br/>
So, daddy come home in a Cadillac brome, cadillac brome<br/>
Now don't it sound absurd<br/>
Claim College Park where they flip them birds<br/>
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves<br/>
Chop chop, chunk it up fat man herb<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ludacris]</i><br/>
It's illegal bout the plants in my backyard grow, that's my bud<br/>
Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck<br/>
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, NIGGA WHAT?!<br/>
Act like I don't make cloud, how you gonna act like I don't get loud?<br/>
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?<br/>
and leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile<br/>
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt<br/>
but, I guess what you don't really know don't hurt<br/>
with a vest, and a pump hear the shotgun squirt<br/>
My folks on the block, man, they got that word (they got that word)<br/>
Don't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood<br/>
Protect your chest, they up to no good<br/>
and come through flossin, they wish y'all would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Worldwide hustlers get that dough<br/>
work that tip, get rid of evidence, move that brick<br/>
Keep a D eagle with an extra clip<br/>
think it ain't so, SUCK A DICK!<br/>
Act like I just do rap<br/>
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?<br/>
How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?<br/>
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on BACK!<br/>
Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze<br/>
With a mac, with a glock I'ma make 'em say please<br/>
In the back, on block so the cops they freeze<br/>
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, you gotta nose bleed?<br/>
Don't it smell so sweet?<br/>
In DECATUR, where they pack that heat<br/>
And ROB neighbors in the night creep, creep<br/>
I'll see you LATER we'll be in them streets...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2x]</i>
