This song is rated M for mature!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yeah, press the start button (woo!)<br/>
Tell these hoes to press the start button (what!)<br/>
Punch in your code and press the start button<br/>
And let the muh'fuckin games begin, biatch!<br/>
For any ONE of these flows just press the start button<br/>
Yea, tell my foes to press the start button<br/>
For a Ludacris show, just press the start button<br/>
And let the muh'fuckin games begin, biatch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Hey, look here<br/>
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture<br/>
Eyes low cause Igloo done rolled the perfect swisha<br/>
Hit you with the weaponry, tell your soldiers to back down<br/>
I'm (Raw) like W.E., you'll get (SmackDown!)<br/>
How you want it? I'll clobber my opponents like Blanka<br/>
Boy, you (Street Fightin) with a monster<br/>
A-Town mobster, blowin smoke like rastas<br/>
Pullin out guns like in (Contra), mo' toys than Tonka<br/>
I'm a fuckin problem, rob 'em<br/>
It's (Grand Theft Auto), his burner's right beside him<br/>
Hollow points headed to your dome<br/>
Hollow points headed to your home<br/>
Your head of lettuce shredded from the chrome<br/>
It's ludicrous parents think I'm a weirdo<br/>
I'm a (God of War), you a (Guitar Hero)<br/>
So let's box like Tyson, you'll get (Punched Out)<br/>
Welcome to Luda's world, now bring the blunts out!<br/>
Hahhhhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
I'm (Liver) than NBA, Luda's (Super) like Mario<br/>
That Playstation 4 shit, you older than Atari hoe!<br/>
Flows that'll make MC's (Go!) like Diego<br/>
Call me the Master Chief, my life is like (Halo)<br/>
Fightin off haters, I'm the best, ask Khaled<br/>
I'm at the (Call of Duty), plus my (Metal Gear) is (Solid)<br/>
My (Resident) is (Evil), full of Southside riders<br/>
I hope you're (Pac'd-Man), I got six (Virtua Fighters)<br/>
That'll (Blitz) ya like Madden '09<br/>
Or hit you with the mac and fo' 9's<br/>
Then later sit back and blow pine<br/>
like it's somethin to do, it ain't pretty<br/>
The (Final Fantasy), they think they live in (SimCity)<br/>
But I'm a (MechWarrior), try me and I'll damage ya<br/>
Holdin a (Soul Calibur), or shoot you like (Galaga)<br/>
And my (Creed Assassins) ya, so clear the room<br/>
Before the shotgun helps you meet your (Ultimate Doom), boyyyyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Whether 25 thousand or 25 mil'<br/>
Survival of the fittest, either kill or be killed<br/>
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on (what?!)<br/>
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on<br/>
Doesn't matter if it's 25 bricks or it's 25 bucks<br/>
Survival of the fittest, either stick or get stuck<br/>
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on (what?!)<br/>
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on<br/>
HEYYYY!<br/>
<br/>
