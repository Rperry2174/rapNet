"Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game" - <i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Jigga! Feel me<br/>
People, told ya motherfuckers, told ya<br/>
"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke" - <i>[OutKast]</i><br/>
Uhh, Roc-a-Fella<br/>
Geyeah<br/>
<br/>
We treat this rap shit just like, handlin weight<br/>
What they want we give it to em, what they abandon we take<br/>
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake<br/>
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake<br/>
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state<br/>
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate<br/>
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area<br/>
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit<br/>
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio<br/>
Let em test the product, give em a promo show<br/>
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe<br/>
Then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five<br/>
Ain't tryin to, kill em at first just, buildin clientele<br/>
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale<br/>
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo<br/>
You don't want no garbage papi it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'<br/>

<br/>
Ge-ge-geyeah<br/>
I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk<br/>
Got your whole block now, pumpin my work<br/>
My CD's is like keys for you Willie's who<br/>
like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's<br/>
And my singles like gems, you know the treys<br/>
Get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay<br/>
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks<br/>
Cause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit<br/>
Never pitchin for a label, Jigga's the hook-up<br/>
You know my shit is fish scale, y'all niggaz is cook up<br/>
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota<br/>
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda<br/>
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key<br/>
Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories<br/>
Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked<br/>
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, ha ha<br/>
