<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Have you ever?<br/>
Have you ever?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Have you ever been to heaven? Have you ever seen the gates?<br/>
Have you bow down to your highness? And do you know how heaven taste?<br/>
Lie me down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head - this is God body<br/>
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding - we just want our equality<br/>
Food, clothing, shelter - help a nigga find some peace<br/>
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in the streets<br/>
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati<br/>
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body<br/>
He's 6'2, how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?<br/>
Aw fuck it you got me<br/>
Question religion, question it all<br/>
Question existence until them questions are solved<br/>
Meanwhile this heretic I be out in Marrakesh<br/>
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship<br/>
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo Yellow shit<br/>
Color of Jello-O shit<br/>
Hello bitch, it's me again<br/>
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's me in the corner<br/>
That's me in the spotlight<br/>
Losing my religion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Getting ghost in the Ghost<br/>
Can you see me?<br/>
Can you see me?<br/>
Have mercy on a Judas, angels wings on a 'ghini<br/>
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down<br/>
Y'all religion creates division<br/>
Like my Maybach partition n<br/>
God is my chauffeur<br/>
<br/>
Boy they loves Hova<br/>
From the south side of Chi<br/>
To Brooklyn where I growed up I confess<br/>
God in the flesh<br/>
Live among the serpents<br/>
Turn arenas into churches<br/>
I'm like Michael recycle, these are not 16s<br/>
These are verses from bible<br/>
Tell the preacher he's a preacher<br/>
I'm a motherfucking prophet, smoke a tree of knowledge<br/>
Drink from a gold chalice, you gotta love it<br/>
I arrive at pearly gates, I had luggage<br/>
Meaning I had baggage<br/>
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters<br/>
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 2x]</i>
