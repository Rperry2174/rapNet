Back at'cha<br/>
How we do<br/>
Primo, Jigga-Man<br/>
History in the making<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, uh-huh-uh-UHH<br/>
Uh-huh-uh-uhh, uhh<br/>
I spit the murder-murder-murderous<br/>
Mur-mur-ma-murderous SHIT<br/>
Uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-UHH<br/>
I keep the gangsta-gangsta-gangsta<br/>
Gah-gah-ga-gangsta beat, feel me? Uhh<br/>
I spit that Brooklyn-Brooklyn-Brook<br/>
Uh-uhh, uh-huh-uh-uhh, uh-uhh<br/>
Uh-huh-UHH<br/>
<br/>
Yo.. career crook, nobody rap Brooklyn like me<br/>
Jigga-Man, Volume 3, I'm back lookin like me<br/>
Stop the presses, baby girls, drop your dresses<br/>
B-K lick a shot for Big Pop' in heaven<br/>
Ever since I came through, niggaz got the impression<br/>
everything I drop, out of the question, stop the guessin<br/>
it's hot, flows provin I pack cause my dough's movin<br/>
My whole crew up in this muh'fucker<br/>
We spray corners, stand there like you got a cape on ya, fine<br/>
You'll be wearing a black suit a long time<br/>
I put your crew in hard bottoms<br/>
The priest is like, "God's got him<br/>
He never did nuttin to nobody but them boys shot him"<br/>
Brandish iron, outlandish buyin<br/>
Bentley Coupes, not braggin just simply the truth<br/>
We all from the ghetto, only difference, we go back<br/>
Back up in D&amp;D on this Primo track, listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z {scratching by DJ Premier}]</i><br/>
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me<br/>
"Iceberg, Slim baby ride rims"<br/>
I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me<br/>
"You know him well.." "..by the name of Jigga"<br/>
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me<br/>
"You can love me or hate me.." "..Jay-Z"<br/>
I'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me<br/>
"Roc-a-Fella lock the whole block down"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Wednesday's I'm up in Shine, Cheetah's Monday night<br/>
I'm fuckin with the model chicks Friday night at Life<br/>
So I'm cruisin in the car with this boozy broad<br/>
She said, "Jigga-Man you rich, take the doo-rag off"<br/>
Hit a U-turn; ma I'm droppin you back off<br/>
Front of the club, "Jigga why you do that for?"<br/>
Thug nigga til the end, tell a friend bitch<br/>
Won't change for no paper plus I been rich<br/>
Eighty-eight been hustlin, linen been crushin em<br/>
Women been fuckin them HUH?<br/>
You see I live for the love of the street<br/>
Rap to the ruggedest beats<br/>
Hall closet cluttered with heat<br/>
I spit that murder-murder-murder<br/>
that Brook-Brook-a-Brooklyn shit<br/>
Furthermore ma..<br/>
We tote guns to the Grammy's, pop bottles on the White House lawn<br/>
Guess I'm just the same old Shawn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm from the M-to-the-A-baby-R-C-Y<br/>
So it's hard for me to let the larceny die<br/>
Niggaz see me in the streets with no bodyguards<br/>
just two big guns that'll body your squad<br/>
Could niggaz be scheamin on me? Probably are<br/>
Think Jigga's a joke nigga? Hardy har<br/>
I spit Brook-Brook-Brooklyn every time I bust<br/>
Radio's gotta play me though I cuss too much<br/>
Magazine said I'm shallow, I never learned to swim<br/>
Still they put me on they cover cause I earn for them<br/>
Soon as I sell too much, watch them turn on him<br/>
cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them<br/>
I spit that murder-murder-murderous everytime a verbalist<br/>
iller than Verbal Kint is or O-Dog in "Menace"<br/>
I'm ill, start to finish, I rip apart contenders<br/>
I'm hot.. hehehehe..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me, uhh<br/>
I'm so gutter, ghetto girls ..<br/>
Heheh, (uhh, uhh, uh-huh-uh-uhh), yeah<br/>
Uhh, yeah, funk, yeah, with me, yeah, beyotch, yeah<br/>
Jigga, yeah, Primo, yeah, gangsta, yeah, niggaz, yeah<br/>
