<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now that all the smoke is gone<br/>
And the battle's finally won<br/>
Victory is finally ours<br/>
History so long so long so long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
In search of victory she keeps saluting me<br/>
If only we can be together momentarily<br/>
We can make love and make history<br/>
Why won't you visit me<br/>
Until she visits me<br/>
I'll be stuck with a sister her name is defeat<br/>
She gives me agony so much agony she brings me so much pain<br/>
So much misery like missing your last shot and falling to your knees<br/>
As the crowd screams brother of the team I practiced so hard for this moment<br/>
Victory don't leave<br/>
I know what this means I'm stuck in this routine<br/>
Whole new different day same old thing<br/>
All I got is dreams no body else can see<br/>
Nobody else believes nobody else but me<br/>
Where are you victory<br/>
I need you desperately<br/>
Not just for the moment to make history<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
So now I'm flirting with death<br/>
Hustling like a g<br/>
When victory wasn't watching<br/>
Took chance repeatedly<br/>
As a teenage boy before acne<br/>
Before I got proactive I couldn't face she<br/>
I Just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets<br/>
That's where I met success<br/>
We lived together shortly<br/>
Now success was like lust shes good to the touch<br/>
Shes good for the moment but shes never enough<br/>
Everybodys had her shes nothing like v<br/>
But success is all I got unfortunately<br/>
But I'm burning down the block<br/>
I been in and out of v<br/>
But something tells me that there's much more to see<br/>
Before I get killed cause I can't get robbed<br/>
So before me success and death monage<br/>
I gotta lost I gotta find v<br/>
We gotta be together to make history<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Now victory is mine she tastes so sweet<br/>
Shes my trophy wife coming with me<br/>
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly<br/>
We'll name him history he'll repeat after me<br/>
Hes my legacy son of my hard work future of my past<br/>
Can explain who I be rate me amongst the greats either 1 2 3<br/>
If I ain't number one then I failed you victory<br/>
Ain't in it for the fame that dies within weeks<br/>
Ain't in it for the money you can take it when u leave<br/>
I wanna be remembered long after u breathe<br/>
Long after I'm gone long after I breathe<br/>
I leave all I am in the hands of history<br/>
That's my last will testimony<br/>
This is much more than a song it's a baby shower<br/>
I been waiting for this hour history your ours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Fade out]</i>
