Uh, yeah, mmmm<br/>
William H. niggas<br/>
Holla, yeah, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK:]</i><br/>
That's why I, squeeze first ask quesions last<br/>
That's how most of these so called gangstas pass<br/>
I, squeeze first ask questions last<br/>
Cuz when I pull up, always pop, that's why I'm livin today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[JIGGA]</i><br/>
Yo, when I meet ya, I heat ya down<br/>
When I greet ya, meet ya with pound<br/>
Not the handshake, but the kind that make ya demand a wake<br/>
The kind that put land over your face<br/>
I pop ya, let doctors stitch ya<br/>
I-N-F-R-A, will not miss ya<br/>
I move light, like my shoes too tight<br/>
Leave niggas confused from the day to the night<br/>
At night, see the light, when the pistol's sparkin<br/>
Daytime it gets dark when that pistol barkin<br/>
I keep cash 'case cops arrest me<br/>
'case kids kidnap me, kids could get back me<br/>
You shall repent 'fore you spend a red cent<br/>
If not, you somebody up close to sin<br/>
Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he<br/>
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Correy<br/>
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult<br/>
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke<br/>
And y'all choke motherfuckers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[JIGGA]</i><br/>
I said thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he<br/>
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Correy<br/>
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult<br/>
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke<br/>
Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he<br/>
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Correy<br/>
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult<br/>
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke<br/>
And y'all choke niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[JIGGA]</i><br/>
Y'all don't understand<br/>
I said thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he<br/>
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Correy<br/>
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult<br/>
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke<br/>
Y'all choke niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[JIGGA]</i><br/>
See when I'm low in digits, I push blow in a blizzard<br/>
I'm a player for real, I post and pivot<br/>
Coke distribute, be where the ghostes visit<br/>
Where the demons live, shit my scene is vivid<br/>
Squeamish kids, y'all get the fuck outta this verse<br/>
It's about to get so obscene in a minute<br/>
I seen and live it, I did some things I admit it<br/>
Wasn't proud of it, but I was a child fuck it<br/>
Kept a pow tucked in a brown belt<br/>
Couldn't sit down, big gun kept stickin my pelvis<br/>
Shit it was either that or be livin wit Elvis<br/>
Niggas is jealous, hell is hot, you heard X<br/>
Wanted to tell God that I don't deserve this<br/>
Was afraid that he'd tell me I deserve less<br/>
My life was nervous, you haven't heard stress<br/>
Til you heard the cries of my mama, me givin her drama<br/>
Told her I aint promised tomorrow, gotta live for the day<br/>
And before she could say Jay...<br/>
I was out the door, pouch full of raw, a outlaw mentality<br/>
Men gotta do men things for men salary<br/>
Bad Boy, not Puff or Mike Lowery, damn B.I.G. woulda been proud of me<br/>
Ahh shit man...<br/>
Young Hova ya heard?<br/>
Who could fuck wit him?
