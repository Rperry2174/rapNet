<i>[Pain In Da Ass]</i> <br/>
<i>[gunshots]</i> OKAY, I'M RELOADED!!! <br/>
You motherfuckers, think you big time? <br/>
Fuckin with Jay-Z, you gon' die, big time!<br/>
Here come the "Pain"! <i>[gunshots]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Jigga... (Jigga), Bigga... (Bigga)<br/>
Nigga, how you figure... (how you figure)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyyo<br/>
<br/>
Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us (uh-huh)<br/>
The number one question is can the Feds get us (uh-huh)<br/>
I got vendettas in dice games against ass betters (uh-huh)<br/>
and niggaz who pump wheels and drive Jettas<br/>
Take that witcha..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
.. hit ya, back split ya<br/>
Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles<br/>
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle<br/>
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle<br/>
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated <br/>
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related<br/>
Most hate it..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
.. can't fade it<br/>
While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly<br/>
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me <br/>
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli <br/>
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him <br/>
What's ya name?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
.. Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra<br/>
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet<br/>
Tryin to push 700's, they ain't made them yet<br/>
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too<br/>
Niggaz 'round the way call me Igloo Stix (Who?)<br/>
Motherfucker!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers<br/>
(Where you from?) Brooklyn, goin out for all<br/>
Marcy - that's right - you don't stop<br/>
Bed-Stuy.. you won't stop, nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What, what, what?<br/>
Jay-Z, Big' Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers<br/>
Brooklyn represent y'all, hit you fold<br/>
You crazy, think your little bit of rhymes can play me?<br/>
I'm from Marcy, I'm varsity, chump, you're JV<br/>
(Jigga) Jay-Z<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
.. and Bigga baby!<br/>
My Bed-Stuy flow's malicious, delicious<br/>
Fuck three wishes, made my road to riches<br/>
from 62's, gem stars, my moms dishes<br/>
Gram choppin, police van dockin<br/>
D's at my doors knockin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What? Keep rockin<br/>
No more, Mister, Nice Guy, I twist your shit <br/>
the fuck back with them pistols, blazin<br/>
Hot like cajun<br/>
Hotter than even holdin work at the Days Inn<br/>
with New York plates outside<br/>
Get up outta there, fuck your ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper<br/>
Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank Wright<br/>
Leave the keys to your In-tegra (That's right)<br/>
Chill homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me<br/>
You're holdin more drugs than a pharmacy, you ain't harmin me<br/>
So pardon me, pass the safe, before I blaze the place <br/>
and here's six shots just in case<br/>
(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers<br/>
(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all<br/>
(Crown Heights...) You don't stop<br/>
(Brownsville...) You won't stop, nigga!<br/>
(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...)<br/>
Hah hah! Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers<br/>
(Where we from?) Brooklyn goin out to all<br/>
(Bushwick...) You don't stop<br/>
(Fort Greene...) You won't stop, niggaz!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
For nine six, the only MC with a flu<br/>
Yeah I rhyme sick, I be what you're tryin to do<br/>
Made a fortune off Peru, extradite, china white heron<br/>
Nigga please, like short sleeves I bear arms<br/>
Stay out my way from here on (CLEAR?) Gone!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notoriuos B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Me and Gutter had two spots<br/>
The two for five dollar hits, the blue tops<br/>
Gotta go, Coolio mean it's gettin "Too Hot"<br/>
If Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two-Pac's<br/>
Get it? .. Tu-pac's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Time to separate the pros from the cons<br/>
The platinum from the bronze<br/>
That butter soft shit from that leather on the Fonz<br/>
A S1 diamond from a eye class don<br/>
A Cham' Dom' sipper from a Rosay nigga, huh?!<br/>
Brook-Nam, sippin on <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
Cristal forever, play the crib when it's mink weather<br/>
The M.A.F.I.A. keep canons in they Marc Buchanans<br/>
Usually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow, tossin ya<br/>
Mad slugs through your Nautica, I'm warnin ya<br/>
(Hah, what the fuck?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers<br/>
(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all<br/>
(Flatbush...) You don't stop<br/>
(Redhook...) You won't stop, nigga!<br/>
(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...)<br/>
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers<br/>
(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all<br/>
(East New York...) You don't stop<br/>
(Clinton Hill...) You won't stop, nigga!<br/>
("Is Brooklyn in the house?")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Uhh, Roc-A-Fella, y'all, Junior M.A.F.I.A. <br/>
Superbad click, Brook-lyn's Finest, you re-wind this <br/>
Represetin BK to the fullest
