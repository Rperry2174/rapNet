<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Ya-yah-yah, ya-ya-yah-yeah bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi-geyeah bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Get it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
<br/>
Can I hit in the MORNING<br/>
without giving you half of my dough<br/>
And even worse if I was broke would you WANT ME?<br/>
If I couldn't get you finer things<br/>
like all of them diamond rings <i>[niggaz]</i> KILL FOR<br/>
would you STILL ROLL?<br/>
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand<br/>
would you RIDE THEN, if it wasn't DROPPIN?<br/>
If wasn't ah, eight figure <i>[nigga]</i> by the name of Jigga<br/>
would you come around naked, would you clown me?<br/>
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya<br/>
put your two lips on my <i>[dick]</i>, kiss it - could ya<br/>
see yourself with a <i>[nigga]</i> workin harder than 9 to 5<br/>
contend with six, two jobs to survive, or<br/>
do you need a BALLA?  So you can shop and tear the MALL UP?<br/>
Brag, tell your friends what I BOUGHT YA<br/>
If you couldn't see yourself with a <i>[nigga]</i> when his dough is low<br/>
Baby girl, if this is so, yo..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Can I get a WHAT WHAT<br/>
to these chickens from all of my doves<br/>
who don't love those, they get no dough<br/>
<i>[Amil]</i><br/>
Can I get a WOOP WOOP<br/>
to these fellas from all of my ladies<br/>
who don't got love for players without dubs?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amil]</i> Now can you bounce wit me, uhh<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Amil]</i> Uh uh.. Major Coins<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Amil]</i> Yeah, not done<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Amil]</i> Uh-uh uh uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Amil]</i><br/>
<br/>
You ain't gotta be rich but FUNK DAT<br/>
How a <i>[bitch]</i> gonna get around your BUS PASS<br/>
? put this <i>[ass]</i> on your mustache<br/>
Can you AFFORD ME, my ? ? this, never corny<br/>
Ambition makes me, so horny, I come fussin in the<br/>
FRONT END, if you got nuttin, baby boy, you betta<br/>
"Git Up, Git Out and get somethin" <i>[Shit!]</i><br/>
I like a, lot of Pravada, Alize and Baca<br/>
Late nights, candlelight, can I tear the <i>[cock]</i> up<br/>
Get it up I put it down anytime it pop up<br/>
I got to snap em, let it loose, then I knock ya<br/>
Feel the juice, then I got ya, when you produce a rocka<br/>
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa<br/>
My, <i>[shit]</i> remains in a Gucci name<br/>
Never test my patience sweetie, I'm high maintenance<br/>
HIGH CLASS, if you ain't rollin, bypass<br/>
If you ain't holdin <i>[shit]</i>, I dash yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Now can you bounce for me, bounce for me<br/>
<i>[Ja]</i> Uhh<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Ja]</i> Uhh!<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Gi-gi-gi-geyeah-geyeah<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Ja]</i> UHH!<br/>

<i>[Ja]</i> Uhh!  Yeah<br/>

<i>[Verse Three: Ja]</i><br/>
<br/>
It ain't even a question<br/>
how my dough flows, you good if you got those<br/>
Lady, ride in your bump, like a Tahoe<br/>
What you ain't know, it's eazy, but hear me though<br/>
Baby girl, best have my, money fo' sho'<br/>
Before they go, runnin they mouth, promotin half<br/>
I be bangin they, back out, go 'head, let it out<br/>
I leave em with no doubts, bounce, toss a hundred<br/>
Makin em feel, taunted even if they don't want it<br/>
It's been SO LONG<br/>
since I met a chick ain't on my tips but then I'm<br/>
DEAD WRONG, when I tell em BE GONE<br/>
So HOLD ON to the feelin of flossin and platinum<br/>
cause from NOW ON, you can witness Ja the I-CON<br/>
with hoodies and TIMBS ON, cause I thugs my women<br/>
VeVe, studs my women, if you wit me you wit em<br/>
I'm talkin bout good livin are we here, you wit us?<br/>
If not Boo, you know what, I still got you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Now can you bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
