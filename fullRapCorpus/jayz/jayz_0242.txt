<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah!!<br/>
Check it, check it out<br/>
Uhhh, haha, gotta keep it fat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
I can't get with that<br/>
I gotta keep it thick never miss so I hit em like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Straight to the track, my lyrics is phat, I rip it the hell -- down<br/>
More than a fluke, I'm regularly wreckin this joint so what -- now<br/>
With so many niggas that's biting it's harder to detect who I be<br/>
Well check out the J, check out the A, check out the Y, Z<br/>
Original rap, I'm makin it slap, I'm hemmin it up like that<br/>
Stingin it, strikin it, swingin it fat, <i>[DJ reverse]</i> bring it back<br/>
I be that nigga with a gat, boom-clack<br/>
Don't ever sweat it when I go, I zoom back<br/>
Better than ever, never better, you better, whatever<br/>
I suggest the Ex-Lax and that'll get your shit together<br/>
I give you a snotty nose from body blows<br/>
Nobody's safe at a party even Gotti goes adios<br/>
I got-got-got Flav-flav-flav-flavor, so save yours<br/>
One verse and it's a hearse, I played and I slayed yours<br/>
Get it, got it, ready to flip, I doubt it<br/>
No need to prolong, check out the man gone, haha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
The next, player, never get no rest, you're livin with stress<br/>
Cause just around the corner beez the best player<br/>
You're fearin my clout, if weed got you runnin your mouth<br/>
You better blow that shhhiiitt out<br/>
The Jigga's back, you brothers are flat<br/>
I'll amaze the way that Jay rap, now how in the hell did he say that?<br/>
You diggin me, the, epitome of, rippin it raw<br/>
You kiddin me, no artist that rap, gettin bigger thzn me<br/>
Although these cats are wettin my style, I'm still thristy<br/>
And we all gotta fall off, but you first G<br/>
I'll be the last, it'll be a, cold day in hell <br/>
before you see me, Sauce and Jaz, chillin with your wack ass<br/>
We make hits, and harmony, like Take 6<br/>
While you brothers double pumped up them fake hits<br/>
Our Roc-A-Fella never Sell-A-Out<br/>
Brothers who don't have the heart, you better tell your mouth, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Ha-hah<br/>
This how we do<br/>
All year round, this is how it goes down<br/>
Now check it out<br/>
<br/>
I don't kick it I punt it, I'm so wicked you want it?<br/>
My tongue is tired from lickin my fingers and countin up hundreds<br/>
So I bought a money machine and it goes<br/>
A tat-tat-trrrittaat-tat-triiatttt-at-tit-tit-tit-dough<br/>
How many styles I gotta kick to prove I'm def?<br/>
I can even-hah-kick my-hah-rip that shit-hah-and catch a breath<br/>
You can't see this, ask this nigga Dash<br/>
Now he don't count cause I'm makin him mad rich<br/>
This nigga's nothin but the truth<br/>
Many view Jay-Z as a threat to they loot.. so<br/>
my thing is tight, can't slip, gotta grip<br/>
like a pit in a dog fight, yo, I'm a-iight<br/>
I ain't checkin for you 'less you my peoples<br/>
And just in case you didn't know peep the -- steelo<br/>
It goes, one dime for your mind<br/>
Two bone crushers for your spine<br/>
Cause none of ya game is rougher than mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ha-hah.. Jay-Z.. live in the ninety-five<br/>
with a little help along, c'mon<br/>
Sacue Money defintly repesentin<br/>
Big Jaz in the house<br/>
Superman production type shit
