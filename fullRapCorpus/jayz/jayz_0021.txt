How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?<br/>
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?<br/>
How can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga <br/>
he never even met that he dont even know and shit?<br/>
I think this rap shit is all beef<br/>
<br/>
Y'all dont even know every day I'm livin with stress<br/>
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest<br/>
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless<br/>
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest<br/>
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?<br/>
I'try not to brush against they chest<br/>
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped<br/>
Swear to everything when I leave this earth<br/>
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt<br/>
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine<br/>
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines<br/>
Gimme any amount of time dont let Ms. Carter grieve<br/>
at the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve<br/>
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me<br/>
and I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged<br/>
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God <br/>
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars...Lucky Me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Karen Anderson]</i><br/>
You only know what you see, <br/>
You dont understand what it takes to be me.<br/>
<br/>
I hate all girls with alterior motives<br/>
That's why I'm twenty plus years old, no sons no daughters<br/>
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters<br/>
Hear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed<br/>
Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own<br/>
Hate a nigga like that faggot, get your own<br/>
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome<br/>
Knowing one day Im'a have to flip, c'mon<br/>
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Crist don't pop<br/>
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock<br/>
I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact,<br/>
It aint no turning back. Bring It On<br/>
Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much<br/>
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?<br/>
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us<br/>
Steady looking for flaws through us.... Lucky Me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Karen Anderson, Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You only know what you see, <br/>
You dont understand what it takes to be me<br/>
You only know what you see, <br/>
(Since I was 4 years old, I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)<br/>
You dont understand what it takes to be me <br/>
(And now that I've arrived<br/>
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold)<br/>
<br/>
Nigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly<br/>
But I know any type of success breeds envy<br/>
I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me<br/>
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny<br/>
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive <br/>
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up<br/>
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up<br/>
Dont grieve for me my art remains<br/>
like a dart from the speaker to your heart<br/>
Spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal<br/>
Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life<br/>
Though I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife<br/>
Next time your thinking heist better be precise<br/>
Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here<br/>
I have no regrets even though I wanna see grow<br/>
My godsons Boogie, Sonny and Rimo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
