...back again &amp; back again<br/>
I went from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
<br/>
As a youth I used to hold the weed up<br/>
old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader<br/>
in order to succeed I had to slow my speed up<br/>
didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the chieva<br/>
they said believe us or not trust is somethin' you earn<br/>
with every mistake you make back to us you return<br/>
probably would go Hollywood I thought he was jokin'<br/>
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smokin'<br/>
All engulfed into honeys the pussy was tight<br/>
if she threw the pussy right I got mushy like<br/>
Damn baby I love you take all my cash<br/>
"You ain't got to lie Jay," you already gettin' the ass<br/>
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on<br/>
soon as I got soft it turned her off<br/>
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissin' my friends<br/>
&amp; that's when the ceiling fell in<br/>
<br/>
I went from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
I went from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
<br/>
I came through with the shines<br/>
like the streets was blind<br/>
didn't master my Algebra no caliber<br/>
Stick me? I was thinkin' how &amp; for what<br/>
but reality bites like a thousand mutts<br/>
Nothin' worse than the person that's foul with guts<br/>
to stick you quicker...<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i><br/>
This brand new nigga<br/>
yup this is the foulest this ain't Hollywood<br/>
It's the Wild West whoever guns is the loudest<br/>
that's who's the best now take ten steps &amp; draw<br/>
who dope can take ten steps &amp; remain raw<br/>
Who has no regards for the law?<br/>
Me that's who now let me ask you<br/>
Did you not know if we all don't eat<br/>
some day that we all would beef?<br/>
Did you know about the crabs in the barrow<br/>
they would hear me creep<br/>
it's a muthafuckin' war in these streets<br/>
<br/>
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto<br/>
&amp; I'm back again I'm back again<br/>
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto<br/>
&amp; I'm back again I'm back again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
...from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
...from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sauce]</i><br/>
As a youth I used to fold up<br/>
old heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier<br/>
Back in the days never no heat thought shit was cool<br/>
good cat personified even went to school<br/>
learned wild shit made me feel kinda live<br/>
off of nothin' with this bullshit 9 to 5<br/>
I stayed broke made me easier to provoke<br/>
ready to yoke the first muthafucka that joked<br/>
Same dude with the hard bottom<br/>
went from laid back to locced out<br/>
from talk it over to t...I shot him<br/>
Ready to perish all the shit you cherish<br/>
leave you the wettest I got a "You die first," fetish<br/>
I can recall helpin' old chicks across the street<br/>
now I help myself liftin' cats off they feet<br/>
Can't give a fuck nigga I just lost my moms<br/>
why I need to feel something steel in both my arms<br/>
<br/>
I went from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
I went from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i><br/>
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto<br/>
&amp; I'm back again I'm back again<br/>
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto<br/>
&amp; I'm back again I'm back again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I went from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again back again<br/>
...from Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again back again<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh uh geah since y'all niggas don't like to think.<br/>
I'ma make it real easy for y'all. You got three different<br/>
types of nigga. First cat, as a youth is real wild &amp;<br/>
for whatever reason he hit the money or whatever,<br/>
cooled out. You got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always<br/>
remained ghetto. You know that type. Then, you got<br/>
one cat very smart young man. E'rybody wanted him<br/>
to be a lawyer doctor whatever. Pressure drove him crazy<br/>
he wiled out. Ha geah...<br/>
<br/>
...Marcy to Hollywood<br/>
&amp; back again &amp; back again<br/>
back again Biotch
