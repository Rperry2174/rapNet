Uh-huh, je-je je-je-jeah<br/>
ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah<br/>
How real is this, how real is this<br/>
Uh-huh huh, Inspect this here, check<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come<br/>
You and your man's hung in every verse in your rhyme<br/>
where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer<br/>
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run<br/>
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set<br/>
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet<br/>
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets<br/>
So I felt some more something and you nothing check<br/>
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much<br/>
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much<br/>
So they ran up Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust<br/>
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us<br/>
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgetable<br/>
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new<br/>
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do<br/>
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it<br/>
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about<br/>
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas<br/>
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are<br/>
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars<br/>
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's<br/>
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars<br/>
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars<br/>
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 5x]</i><br/>
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice<br/>
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
I'm from the place where the chruch is the flakiest<br/>
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist<br/>
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow<br/>
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday<br/>
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells<br/>
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale<br/>
Your laughing, you know the place well<br/>
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well<br/>
And Government, fuck Government, niggas polotic themselves<br/>
Where we call the cops the A-Team<br/>
cause they hop out of vans and spray things<br/>
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen<br/>
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies<br/>
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?<br/>
If the shit is lies, god strike me<br/>
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?<br/>
We'll never know<br/>
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know<br/>
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto<br/>
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done<br/>
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards<br/>
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen<br/>
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street<br/>
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet<br/>
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep<br/>
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet<br/>
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed<br/>
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat<br/>
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with<br/>
Three dice and shoot the five<br/>
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips<br/>
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this<br/>
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist<br/>
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this<br/>
Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs<br/>
Before you know it your lying in a pool of blood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i>
