<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Lucifer, dawn of the morning!<br/>
I'm gonna chase you out of Earth<br/>
Lucifer, Lucifer, dawn of the morning...<br/>
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)<br/>
Lucifer, Lucifer, dawn of the morning!<br/>
I'm gonna chase you out of Earth<br/>
(Kanyeeze you did it again, you're a genius nigga!)<br/>
Lucifer, Lucifer, dawn of the morning...<br/>
So you niggas change your attitude<br/>
For they asking what happened to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Lord forgive him<br/>
He got them dark forces in him<br/>
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning<br/>
Them a murder me so I gotta murder them first<br/>
Emergency doctors performing procedures<br/>
Jesus<br/>
I ain't trying to be facetious<br/>
But "Vengance is mine" said the Lord<br/>
You said it better than all<br/>
Leave niggas on deaths door<br/>
Breathing off res-por-rators<br/>
for killing my best boy, HATERS<br/>
On perminate hiatus as I skate<br/>
In the Maybach Benz<br/>
Flya the Sanna Lathan<br/>
Pumping "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo<br/>
In Los Angeles<br/>
Like an evangelist<br/>
I can introduce you to your maker<br/>
Bring you closer to nature<br/>
Ashes after they cremate you bastards<br/>
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters<br/>
Paying your ties being good Catholics<br/>
I'm coming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Yes<br/>
This is Holly war<br/>
I wet you all with the Holly water<br/>
Spray from the Hetckler Koch auto<br/>
Matic all the static shall cease to exist<br/>
Like a sematical I throw a couple at you<br/>
Take six<br/>
Spread love to all of my dead thugs<br/>
I'll pour out a little Louie 'til I head above<br/>
Yes Sir<br/>
And when I perish<br/>
The meek shall inherit the earth<br/>
Until that time it's on a poppin Church<br/>
Like Don Bishop<br/>
The fifth upon cock either<br/>
Lift up your soul or give the Holly ghost please<br/>
I leave ya in somebody's Cathedral<br/>
And stunting like Evil Kenevil<br/>
I'll let you see where that bright light lead you<br/>
The more you talk the more you irking us<br/>
The more you gonna need memorial services<br/>
The Black Albums second verse is like<br/>
Devil's Pie please save some dessert for us<br/>
<br/>
Man I gotta get my soul right<br/>
I gotta get these Devils out my life<br/>
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride<br/>
They won't be happy 'til somebody dies<br/>
<br/>
Man I gotta get my soul right<br/>
'For I'm locked up for my whole life<br/>
Everytime it seems it's all right<br/>
Somebody want they soul to rise<br/>
(I'll chase you off of this Earth)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
I got dreams of holding a Nine milla<br/>
To Bobs killer<br/>
Asking him "why?" as my eyes fill up<br/>
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow<br/>
Gone but not forgotten Holmes I still feel ya<br/>
So... curse the day that birthed the bastard<br/>
Who caused your Church mass<br/>
Reverse the crash<br/>
Reverse the blast<br/>
And reverse the car<br/>
Reverse the day, and there you are<br/>
Bobalob<br/>
Lord forgive him we all have sinned<br/>
But Bobs a good dude please let him in<br/>
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge<br/>
Please blame it on the sun of the mourning<br/>
Thanks Again
