Swear to God I just touched down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z + (LaToiya)]</i><br/>
All around the world.. (same song)<br/>
Killa Cali nigga (same song)<br/>
A-T-L (same song)<br/>
Real-adelphia.. dude it's all around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
London, England, South of France<br/>
And all points between they know about your man<br/>
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan<br/>
I'm a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am<br/>
piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew<br/>
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw<br/>
Spot me the hotel, the Cap', or Capri<br/>
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like weed<br/>
Your man'll stand manta ray, handlin a steak<br/>
And handlin the modern stand about five-eight<br/>
Five-nine fine wine fine dine either that<br/>
or I'm mixin in Switzerland, tryin to buy time<br/>
Ballin out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali<br/>
Brunchin at the 4 Seasons, off the heezy<br/>
When it's back home nigga back to the zone<br/>
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z + (LaToiya)]</i><br/>
All around the world.. (same song)<br/>
Brooklyn bombers (same song)<br/>
Detroit players (same song)<br/>
Chi-Town.. all around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Said it's all love, Sure Club, M-I-A<br/>
Party at bungalow eight, when I stay<br/>
Pool look like a hundred Beyonce's<br/>
A couple fiances, I'm the new DeVante<br/>
"Come and Talk to Me" mami in the Ea-sy<br/>
Garant, I hope, she ain't too young<br/>
Only twenty-one and older let another nigga mold her<br/>
I'm just tryin to show her how a baller and a roller<br/>
sleep one place, sell the pie to keep the engine<br/>
runnin then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard<br/>
Same boss this year, I think I'm gon' spend Christmas<br/>
reminisce about the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas<br/>
Now I'm gon' send her on her own little wish list<br/>
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl<br/>
Forever my lady, blind crippled and crazy<br/>
A ticket and you pay to see D - sweet Sade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LaToiya]</i><br/>
Sade, Sade, don't you know I love you sweet Sade, Sade<br/>
All around the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Said it ain't where you from yo it's where you at<br/>
Real niggaz out in Brooklyn, some niggaz don't clap<br/>
It's real killers out in Cali, some niggaz just act<br/>
Hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good<br/>
Real players in the D-Twa, some of them throwed<br/>
Slackin on they mackin, rest haven for hoes<br/>
Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks<br/>
Disciplined Gangsters, come on Charlie I know<br/>
Shit it ain't about your city or borough<br/>
It's bout if you really as thorough<br/>
And if you are, holla at your boy<br/>
I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you<br/>
Real recognize real and you lookin familiar<br/>
I'ma Bed-Stuy nigga but I do it to death<br/>
I promise I'm as St. Thomas homey eatin at Chef's<br/>
One-twelve, A-T-L, the sun up yet?<br/>
Then we party like the sun don't set<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LaToiya]</i><br/>
We gon' take you all around the world.. it's the same song (same song)<br/>
Everywhere (same song)<br/>
It's the same song (same song)<br/>
We gon' take you all around the world.. same song (same song)<br/>
Same song (same song)<br/>
Same song (same song)<br/>
All around the world..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[harmonizing to the end]</i>
