Get ya ass on the celly<br/>
Cause I ain't got time<br/>
To be arguing with your ass<br/>
If you ain't really ready<br/>
<br/>
Girl why you never ready<br/>
For as long as you took<br/>
You better look like Halle Berry<br/>
Or Beyonc√®. Shit then we getting married<br/>
<br/>
I brought sand to the beach<br/>
Cause my beach is better<br/>
You can keep ya beach<br/>
Cause that beach whatever<br/>
<br/>
Started out at The Darby<br/>
Ended up at 1 Oak<br/>
Left the house with 100 grand<br/>
Ended up near broke<br/>
<br/>
Don't get mad at me<br/>
I'm buying bucket after bucket<br/>
When it's gone I'm like fuck it<br/>
I replace it with another one<br/>
<br/>
Can't take this money with you<br/>
Burn this shit up like I'm richer<br/>
Nigga's asking<br/>
If the oven's on
