I'm not trying to be nosey babe oh no<br/>
I'm not trying to give you no advice<br/>
(Hovie's home)<br/>
I don't plan to be (New addition to the roc) no philosopher<br/>
But I still know this is the life Baby Baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You gotta let this one breathe, just <br/>
Just let it breathe for a sec <br/>
Yup, Hovi's home <br/>
Newest edition to the Roc <br/>
M.O.P. <br/>
The Blueprint 2 is on its way <br/>
I know ya hear my footsteps out there...comin' <br/>
Let's go get 'em just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Fame]</i><br/>
Time to duck, fire<br/>
Duck, fire, duck, fire<br/>
Duck, fire, duck, FIYAAAAAAAHHH!<br/>
<br/>
(U Don't know what you're doing, doing, doing, doing)<br/>
<br/>
It's the MOP (Yes)<br/>
In a zip-code that's<br/>
1, 1, 2, 3, 3<br/>
And motherfucker we comin, 100 miles and gunnin<br/>
I'm still runnin with cash that's robbed<br/>
From the era of exhale 80's and hats back stomp<br/>
(SAME GAME!) operation for this industry lockdown<br/>
We still tote hammers that go BLOCKOWWWW<br/>
Run up if you wanna, believe me dog<br/>
These hammers with they owners, fuck ya G up<br/>
Have ya with blue 'jamas in a coma, and<br/>
Ya family now moan, look, 70 pounds gone<br/>
A little fuck, scribbled up with a hospital down on<br/>
(WE HOLDIN IT DOWN HOLMES!) keep pushin weak frail bastards<br/>
To get over, we prowl with slimmer re-shelled tactics<br/>
Jiminy frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups<br/>
No limit, what the fuck, recordin for nig' junior<br/>
(The game ain't changed)it just got harder<br/>
Plus we sponsored by laz' Dame Dash and Mr. S. Carter<br/>
Brownsville (yep), we stomp in this bitch all day<br/>
Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss off stage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Billy Danze]</i><br/>
Uh, Uh, Uh, I'm from the G side of thangs<br/>
Where we ride and bang, where the heat died of flame<br/>
That's how we got the name (WARRIORS!)<br/>
And better than ya bank, and someone should be tellin 'em<br/>
The veterans have came, and we're better in the game<br/>
(YOU BETTER MAKE IT RAIN!) "27 grams" my man<br/>
It's better than cocaine, now everything will change<br/>
In this family we'll rule the world<br/>
And you haters can eat a dick up till you hiccup and erm<br/>
A decade on the grind, nigga I paid mine<br/>
So it's my time to shine and for you can ride the pine<br/>
I wont sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids<br/>
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young ass kids<br/>
(MOP!) The OG's repped and survived around this motherfucka<br/>
(FIRST FAMILY!) We kept it live around this motherucka<br/>
When it's crunch time, we do it our wizzay<br/>
For shizzle my nigga, learn to grip pistols and BK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
WHOOOOOOO!!!!!!<br/>
Turn my music high, high, high, high-er<br/>
Mo' fire, mo' problems, more Roc-a-wear attire<br/>
Mo' money, mo' murder now that M.O.P.'s hired<br/>
Mo' murder for the ROC empire, ya'll wont surface<br/>
Ya'll nervous knowin them guns on full service, ready to fire<br/>
One body, two body, three body, four<br/>
Young sittin on paper, I'm above the law<br/>
Young shittin on haters, I ain't fuckin with ya'll<br/>
For my Brownsville neighbors, How About Some Hardcore?<br/>
And it just get worser, every time I write my signature in cursive<br/>
Just add another million to these verses<br/>
One million, two million, three million, four<br/>
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose<br/>
My nephew's situated, and my mama's straight<br/>
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come our way<br/>
And you fuckers rappin to me, so your drama is fake<br/>
Ya'll niggas is noodles, I got more fetti to bake<br/>
Let's get it!
