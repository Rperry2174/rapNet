<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Hangin with the honies is the song I sing<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
On the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Bustin my toast off the roof drinkin 90 proof til spring<br/>
Real niggaz do real things, check<br/>
<br/>
We started out makin, small time bacon<br/>
Two little niggaz bakin, talkin bout whippin cakes<br/>
Get clothin and big cheddar, hopin it gets better<br/>
We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever<br/>
In front of your buildin clockin, thought I was makin a killin<br/>
Right in front of your children, eightball in my side pocket<br/>
They was corrupt too, disrespectin the fiends I used to<br/>
look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you<br/>
In different parts of the planet, Oakland to New York<br/>
I'm hollerin Lifetimes, he hollerin Life's Too $hort<br/>
Parallel lives and jew-els held high<br/>
To the Range, to the Rove, get exchanged, for your souls<br/>
You know how the game goes, slang to get G's<br/>
and speak in Chinese everybody gains the same dough<br/>
Get your shit scarred fuckin with my sick squad<br/>
from Marcy, to the Bay y'all, we get large, keep in charge<br/>
<br/>
On the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Hangin with the honies is the song I sing<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
On the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Bustin my toast off the roof drinkin 90 proof til spring<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Too $hort]</i><br/>
So now you own a record label, I got one too<br/>
We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew<br/>
You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records<br/>
On the shelf and on the charts the double deckers<br/>
The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me<br/>
You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?<br/>
I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways<br/>
so I can get paid, everday<br/>
I see the same old shit, I see in the streets<br/>
I know you think I'm sellin keys but I only sell beats<br/>
Dopefiend music, it's drug related<br/>
You can buy it on the corner get a radio and play it<br/>
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud<br/>
Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about<br/>
I know these gay ass record labels keep fuckin niggaz<br/>
It's just like in the streets main, how much you get?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
On the road to riches, and diamond rings<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Hangin with the honies is the song I sing<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
On the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Bustin my toast off the roof drinkin 90 proof til spring<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Too $hort]</i><br/>
That's right, I been a hustler for a long time<br/>
Always got the right beats, never saying wrong rhymes<br/>
I started off with nothing ended up with everything<br/>
Now we sip Hennessee in first class on every plane<br/>
Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm sayin<br/>
Always see me at the bank and yes I'm goin again<br/>
There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy<br/>
Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Now peep, how sweet, niggaz lives can get<br/>
Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect<br/>
$hort Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow<br/>
I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know<br/>
I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fo's<br/>
I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go<br/>
If you want it, keep ballin, and if you jealous stop<br/>
I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac<br/>
How real is that?<br/>
<br/>
On the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Hangin with the honies is the song I sing<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
On the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
Bustin my toast off the roof drinkin 90 proof til spring<br/>
Real niggaz do real things<br/>
And I'm out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Too $hort]</i> Beyotch! $hort Dawg's in the house<br/>
