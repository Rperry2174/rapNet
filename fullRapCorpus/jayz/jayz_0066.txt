<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Is he a Blood, is he Crip?<br/>
Is he that, is he this?<br/>
Did he do it? Y'know, ehh<br/>
Look..<br/>
<br/>
If I shoot you, I'm brainless<br/>
Different toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin this<br/>
I'm waitin on arraignment, my nigga is the plantiff<br/>
Yeah, I know what you thinkin - fucked up ain't it?<br/>
I shoulda known better, and I planned to<br/>
but dog they be takin me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle<br/>
I sat back and watched it, put the gats back in the closet<br/>
I tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage<br/>
Let niggaz take shots at me, no response<br/>
I just - flip and, pop my collar like the Fonz<br/>
You give a nigga a foot he'll take you one step beyond<br/>
He'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm<br/>
You wanna conversate with the writer of the Qu'ran<br/>
or Old Testament, don't test him then<br/>
I know what y'all thinkin dick, pause<br/>
Your future's my past, I've been here before<br/>
I know when you're schemin, I feel when you plottin<br/>
I got, mental vision, intuition<br/>
I know where you goin I read your mind's navigational system<br/>
Everybody whisperin - pst pst pst ss perspirin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When the, streets is talkin, niggaz is gossipin<br/>
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?<br/>
I need to know.. geah geah<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin<br/>
And I only use his waist to keep my glock in<br/>
But when shit goes down you know who's doin the poppin<br/>
And if you don't know, guess who's doin the droppin<br/>
S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood<br/>
Bad move; that's bad news<br/>
How many times have I got to prove?<br/>
How many loved ones have you got to lose<br/>
before you realize that it's probably true?<br/>
Whatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do<br/>
Shit I paid my dues, I made the news<br/>
I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews<br/>
And the streets say Jigga can't go back home<br/>
You know when I heard that? When I was back home<br/>
I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome<br/>
On any Martin Luther, don't part with your future<br/>
Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya<br/>
The answer is simply too dark for the user<br/>
And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows<br/>
But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?<br/>
'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone<br/>
from what the block has spoken, my God<br/>
Everybody stressin, who's his baby's moms?<br/>
Who he got pregnant, let me tell you, ahh...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When the, streets is talkin, niggaz is gossipin<br/>
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?<br/>
I need to know.. chicka-uh-ah, ah-chk-ah-uh-ah<br/>
Chicka-ch-ah, chk-ah-ah-ah<br/>
When the, streets is talkin, niggaz is gossipin<br/>
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?<br/>
I need to know.. gi-gi-gi, geah yeah uh, yeah yeah uh<br/>
Yeah, yo, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know<br/>
I lost my pops when I was eleven mmm twelve years old<br/>
He's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin it's toll<br/>
but I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad<br/>
I grew up pushin snowflake to niggaz that was pro-base<br/>
The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face<br/>
All I did was smoke joke, think and drink<br/>
Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game<br/>
I seen niggaz before me, with a chance to write they own script<br/>
slip up and change the story<br/>
I seen young niggaz go out in a blaze of glory<br/>
before reachin puberty, scared a nigga truthfully<br/>
I took trips with so much shit in the whip<br/>
that if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, SNIFF<br/>
Smell me nigga? The real me nigga, minus the rumors<br/>
Holla if you feel me nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
The streets is not only watchin but they talkin now?<br/>
Shit they got me circlin the block before I'm parkin now<br/>
Don't get it twisted, I ain't bitchin, I'm just cautious now<br/>
So, under the park the extra cartridge now<br/>
Hit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense<br/>
I get word to the street like Bell Atlantic express<br/>
I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors<br/>
But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still ?? ?? Allah<br/>
Niggaz wanna press me, put my back to the wall<br/>
But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all<br/>
To know me is to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this<br/>
Fuck you I got guns like Neo in +Matrix+<br/>
Cross the Family, think Mac's sweet like payroll<br/>
or soft like Play-Doh get knocked off like Fredo<br/>
Corleone, they find you with a hole in your dome<br/>
I roll with niggaz that'll follow you and go to your home<br/>
Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense<br/>
Catch you while you reachin, clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin<br/>
Apply full court pressure<br/>
like four-four ?? get you out of here, pull pressure<br/>
to the trigger, bullets fly in three's<br/>
You forever rest under bullshit, dirt lies and leaves<br/>
I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave<br/>
Look in my eyes, realize it's Beans<br/>
Niggaz wanna despise the team; till I play head coach<br/>
and straight up, divide they team<br/>
Trade they man for some pies and a couple of things<br/>
Til the bullet.. ah, motherfuckers!! Yeah..
