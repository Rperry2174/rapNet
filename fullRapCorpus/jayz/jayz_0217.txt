<i>[Intro: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway<br/>
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché<br/>
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway<br/>
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché<br/>
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah<br/>
An innocent love un-misunderstood, yeah<br/>
Black hour glass, hour glass<br/>
Toast to cliché is in a dark past<br/>
Toast to cliché is in a dark past<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman<br/>
Girl get the bustin' before the cops come running<br/>
Chunking deuces, chugging D'USSE<br/>
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I don't care if we on the run<br/>
Baby as long as I'm next to you<br/>
And if loving you is a crime<br/>
Tell me why do I bring out<br/>
The best in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I hear sirens while we make love<br/>
Loud as hell but they don't know<br/>
They're nowhere near us<br/>
I will hold your heart and your gun<br/>
I don't care if they come, no<br/>
I know it's crazy but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
They can take me<br/>
Now that I found the places that you take me<br/>
Without you I got nothing to lose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick<br/>
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit<br/>
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off<br/>
Even if rings come off<br/>
If things ring off<br/>
My nails get dirty<br/>
My past ain't pretty, my lady is, my Mercedes is<br/>
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas<br/>
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas<br/>
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga<br/>
You know it's 'til the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas<br/>
Cross the line, speak about mine<br/>
I'm a wave this tech, I'm a geek about mine<br/>
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clat<br/>
Push your motherfucking wig back, I did that<br/>
I been wilding since a juvi<br/>
She was a good girl 'til she knew me<br/>
Now she is in the drop bussin' U'e<br/>
Screaming...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Deeper than words, beyond right<br/>
Die for your love, beyond life<br/>
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice<br/>
Blind me baby with your neon lights<br/>
Ray Bans on, police in sight<br/>
Oh, what a beautiful death<br/>
Let's both wear white<br/>
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell<br/>
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's<br/>
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy<br/>
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys<br/>
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it<br/>
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I don't care if they give me life<br/>
I get all of my life from you<br/>
And if loving you had a price<br/>
I would pay my life for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I don't care I'll never give it up<br/>
Give it up, give it up, give it all away<br/>
No I swear I'll never give it up<br/>
Give it up, give it up, give it all away<br/>
I don't care I'll never give it up<br/>
Give it up, give it up, give it all away<br/>
No I swear I'll never give it up<br/>
Give it up, give it up, give it all away<br/>
Without you I got nothing to lose
