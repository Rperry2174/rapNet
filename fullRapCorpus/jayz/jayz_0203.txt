<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Haters, haters, snitch haters!<br/>
And I made myself so easy to love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
How much they hate it, very<br/>
Kiss girls like Katy Perry<br/>
I am never sprung but I Springer, Jerry<br/>
Don't try this at home, results may vary<br/>
King like T.I. but in the Chi, Larry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hoova, HOVA, both are(a)<br/>
American gangstas you choose who's, colder(a)<br/>
Rappers get nasty in the booth,<br/>
But I'm gross, I cant even stomach myself<br/>
Ulcer(a), more realer cause I'm closer(a)<br/>
Had girlies in girldles way more than they suppose to(a),<br/>
Poser(a), No Sir(a),my hustle, so Russell,<br/>
I stretch work, yoga<br/>
You know I got it down dawg,<br/>
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off<br/>
It ain't nothing for me to knock nouns off,<br/>
But these MCs are(a) praying for my downfall,<br/>
They just.. Haters<br/>
I wave at you, I'm so player,<br/>
I'll never be done I'm so rare<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
We Killing the game it's not fair<br/>
You mother fuckers stay right there<br/>
'cause we too high up in the air<br/>
We blasting off just like a laser<br/>
Nigga pewoon, pewoon, pewoon,<br/>
Get me back, give me room, room, room<br/>
DB-9 like vroomm,vroomm, vroom<br/>
Y'all ho what we doing, doing, doing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We balling, bitches,eating y'all food leaving dishes<br/>
Why these niggas always talking lead talk Ye?<br/>
Why I never see them at the Clearport Ye?<br/>
Why I always hear they at the airport<br/>
Why I fly daily like I'm in the airforce<br/>
Therefore, please stop talking my ears off<br/>
Millionaire talk, you haters,<br/>
You mad at me 'cause your paper,<br/>
Need to get his mother fucking weight up<br/>
Wait up<br/>
I ain't done, name one thing that I ain't done<br/>
It hurts when you say that I ain't won,<br/>
you haters, How do I gain your favor,<br/>
I need to know cause I care<br/>
I need you to love me I swear, look here<br/>
See Ye is, runnin' the Chi like Gale Sayers,<br/>
I'm runnin' new york, I got the mayor on my pager<br/>
You cant fade us, you hate us<br/>
I need you, stay there<br/>
I breath you, like air,<br/>
Air<br/>
Where are my haters,<br/>
I love all my haters<br/>
I love all my haters<br/>
I love all my haters
