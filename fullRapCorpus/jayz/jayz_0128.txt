<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers<br/>
I'ma bout 'ta show you how a hustlers life (this is life man)<br/>
and a soldier's life, parallel<br/>
And the one thing they got in common is pain (forget about me for a second)<br/>
Picture split screen<br/>
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block (human beings)<br/>
Other side you got the soldier getting ready for bootcamp (soldiers)<br/>
They're both at war (this is life)<br/>
Stay with us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast<br/>
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
You lost him mama, the wars calling him<br/>
Feel its his duty to fall in line with all of them<br/>
He's a soldier<br/>
Rose through the ranks as the head of your house hold<br/>
Now its time to provide bank<br/>
Like he's supposed tah<br/>
Now just remember while he's going to November<br/>
Theres part of him growing up<br/>
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds yah<br/>
Your heart beatin so fast speeding his pulse up<br/>
Yeah i know it sucks, Life aint a rose bud<br/>
A couple of speed bumps<br/>
You gotta take your lumps<br/>
Off to Bootcamp, the worlds facing terror<br/>
Bin Laden been happenin in Manhatten<br/>
Crack was anthrax back then, back when<br/>
Police was Al'Qaeda to black men<br/>
While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion<br/>
He was off the wall killing for a living<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Days turn to nights, nights turn to years<br/>
Years turn to "how the fuck we make it in here?"<br/>
My barracks average couple fights a day<br/>
Get you locked in a hole wont see the light of day<br/>
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away<br/>
I never thought shit could end up quite this way<br/>
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from<br/>
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run<br/>
I'm here for the purple heart, if I cant take one<br/>
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?<br/>
I love my niggas more then anything else<br/>
This war's about my family, me needin the wealth<br/>
You dont understand how useless as men we felt<br/>
Till you become a 5 star general<br/>
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail<br/>
P.O.W.'s thats still in the war for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Your baby boy is getting grown<br/>
So your baby boy is moving on<br/>
I've gotta chase (gotta chase it)<br/>
If I'm gonna make it (gonna make it)<br/>
Your baby boy is getting grown<br/>
So your baby boy is moving on<br/>
I'm gonna make it<br/>
Even if I gotta take it (gotta take it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Mama said pray your sons becoming a man<br/>
This wars taxin to 'em like Uncle Sam<br/>
He ain't gonna always make the right choice, understand<br/>
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam<br/>
It's death before dishonour<br/>
And if hes gone you should honor his memory<br/>
Dont cry we all gonna die eventually<br/>
But if he's locked in the penetentiary send him some energy<br/>
They all winners to me<br/>
(What's up kid?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
