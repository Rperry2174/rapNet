Woo!  Uhh, uhh<br/>
It's "The Gift &amp; the Curse"<br/>
Uhh, uhh yea<br/>
First they love me then they hate me then they love me again<br/>
.. they love me again<br/>
Let's take a trip down.. I gotcha<br/>
<br/>
Let's take a trip down memory, lane at the cemetery<br/>
Rain grey skies, seems at the end of every<br/>
young black life is this line, "Damn - him already?<br/>
Such a good kid," got us pouring Henn' already<br/>
Liquor to the curb for my, niggas up above<br/>
When it, cracks through the pavement that's my way of sendin love<br/>
So, give Big a hug, tell Aa-liyah I said hi<br/>
'Til the next time I see her, on the other side<br/>
He was just some thug that, caught some slugs<br/>
And we loved him cause, in him we, saw some of us<br/>
He walked like us, talked like us<br/>
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us - damn<br/>
Poor Isis, that's his momma name<br/>
Momma ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?<br/>
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him<br/>
Hot temper, momma said he act just like her husband<br/>
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him<br/>
Isis blaming herself, she wish she could've saved him<br/>
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men<br/>
He was his own man, not even him can save him<br/>
He put his faith in a, thirty-eight in his waist<br/>
But when you live by the gun you die by the same fate<br/>
End up, dead before thirty-eight and umm<br/>
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world<br/>
Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away<br/>
Isis, life just, ended on that rainy day<br/>
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed<br/>
down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude<br/>
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, shift and brew<br/>
Angel dust, dipped in WOO!<br/>
She slipped into, her own fantasy world<br/>
Had herself pregnant by a different dude<br/>
But reality bites and, this is her life<br/>
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife<br/>
It was just this night when, moon was full<br/>
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight<br/>
Had her sounding like Lisa Lisa - I wonder if I take you home<br/>
will you still love me after this night?<br/>
Mike was the hardhead from the around the way<br/>
that she wanted all her life, shit she wanted all the hype<br/>
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike<br/>
He was a Willie all her life he wasn't really the one to like<br/>
It was a, dude named Shy who would really treat her right<br/>
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life<br/>
But I-sis, like this, Broadway life<br/>
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red green and whites<br/>
Hangin out the window when she first seen him fight<br/>
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice<br/>
How ironic it would, be some fight that<br/>
turned into a homicide that'll alter their life<br/>
See Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene<br/>
Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice<br/>
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he dissed on him like<br/>
"If that was my son, he would look much different.<br/>
See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark<br/>
so it's, momma's baby; poppa's maybe."<br/>
Mike was still crazy out there running the streets (fuck niggas want?)<br/>
Had his old reliable with thirty-eight gun in his reach<br/>
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak<br/>
He running around like life's a peach, 'til one day<br/>
he approached this thug that, had a mean mug<br/>
And it looked so familiar that he called him "Young Cuz"<br/>
Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you)<br/>
Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub<br/>
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up)<br/>
There was somethin in this man's face he knew he seen before<br/>
It's like, lookin in the mirror seeing hisself more mature<br/>
And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord<br/>
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war<br/>
(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost<br/>
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank<br/>
The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct<br/>
Six shots into his kid, out of the gun<br/>
Niggas be a father, you're Killing your son<br/>
Six shots into his kid, out of the gun<br/>
Niggas be a father, you Killing your sons<br/>
<br/>
Meet the parents.. <i>[echoes and slows down as it fades]</i>
