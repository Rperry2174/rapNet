<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
(J) uhh (A) uh-uh (Y) uh uh-uh<br/>
Ah ch-ch ah, ch-ah, ah uh-uh<br/>
Ah ch-ch ah, ch-ah, ah uh-uh<br/>
It's that hop I'm talkin bout right here Timbo!<br/>
<br/>
I can't be stopped when it hop like this family, uhh!<br/>
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!)<br/>
<br/>
They say hola' hovito<br/>
That's what they sayin when I roll up with my people<br/>
My music bangin like - them vatos locos got rap in a chokehold<br/>
And I won't surrender it with, beats by Timbaland<br/>
Calle de la boca, my baby<br/>
All I wanna, do is, stroke ya all crazy<br/>
My, dick game is vicious, insane at bitches<br/>
Mami keep comin back cause mami came vicious<br/>
Catch Hov' in the drop, nasty thang lane switchin<br/>
Once you turn your neck for a sec your dame's missin<br/>
Bujando, bujando, the cops is comin<br/>
Got that rap patrol behind yo, get to runnin<br/>
I'm unstoppable Hov', untoppable flows<br/>
I'm the compadre, the Sinatra of my day<br/>
Ol' Blue Eyes my nigga, I did it my way<br/>
If y'all not rollin with Hov' then hit the highway<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Hola' hovito!) Yeah, yeah (Hola' hovito!)<br/>
Yeah that's what they sayin when that music get to bangin<br/>
Put it down for my PEO-PLE!<br/>
(Hola' hovito! Hola' hovito!)<br/>
Yeah that's what they sayin when that music get to bangin<br/>
Put it down for my PEO-PLE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[an extra "yeah" before the 5th line first time, 2nd line second, and the 5th line the third time]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah naw I don't fuck around, stay on my J.O.<br/>
Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old<br/>
Oh, push perrico if I need to for the rule of evil<br/>
Was born in the belly that's the way the streets breed you<br/>
One life to live - notice you get no sequel<br/>
So I truly got to live this like my last movie<br/>
Six oohie, jewels drippin, big toolie<br/>
I ball for real, y'all niggaz is Sam Bouie<br/>
And with the third pick - I made the earth sick<br/>
M.J., hem Jay, fade away perfect<br/>
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme spitter<br/>
Every crime nigga that rhyme or touch a mic because my mind's quicker<br/>
I'm a eighty-eighter, nine-six to "Reasonable Doubt"<br/>
Temper short, don't take much to squeeze you out<br/>
Yeah you shinin but the only thing you're leavin out<br/>
You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hold up; naw muh'fuckers - y'all muh'fuckers<br/>
better run to the post office and get a job muh'fuckers<br/>
A starve muh'fuckers, cause Jay's been the only one<br/>
eatin thus far sub-par muh'fuckers<br/>
Naw even though y'all hate I love y'all muh'fuckers<br/>
"Friend or Foe," y'all all my muh'fuckers<br/>
If you haven't heard, I'm Michael Magic and Bird<br/>
all rolled in one - cause none got more flows than Young<br/>
Plus got more flows to come<br/>
And if I ain't better than Big, I'm the closest one<br/>
So move over - hoes, choose Hova<br/>
My food for though so hot it give you dudes ulcers<br/>
Rovers, roasters, poseurs<br/>
gettin it in with me, livin like they supposed tah<br/>
Watches, chain, front row at the game<br/>
Sold out arena, all screamin my name, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
