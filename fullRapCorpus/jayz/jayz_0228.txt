<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br/>
Do I find it so hard<br/>
When I know in my heart<br/>
I'm letting you down everyday<br/>
Letting you down everyday<br/>
Why do I keep on running away?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Look, I apologize, often womanize<br/>
Took for my child to be born<br/>
See through a woman's eyes<br/>
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles<br/>
Took me too long for this song<br/>
I don't deserve you, I harass you out in Paris<br/>
"Please come back to Rome"<br/>
You make it home<br/>
We talked for hours when you were on tour<br/>
"Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone"<br/>
Said: "Don't embarrass me," instead of "Be mine"<br/>
That was my proposal for us to go steady<br/>
That was your 21st birthday, you mature faster than me<br/>
I wasn't ready, so I apologize<br/>
I've seen the innocence leave your eyes<br/>
I still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborns<br/>
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it<br/>
I apologize to all the woman whom I<br/>
Toyed with you emotions because I was emotionless<br/>
I apologize 'cause at your best you are love<br/>
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about<br/>
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed<br/>
And you stare blankly into space<br/>
Thinkin' of all the time you wasted in on all this basic shit<br/>
So I apologize<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hannah Williams:]</i><br/>
I'm never gonna treat you<br/>
Never gonna treat you like I should<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us<br/>
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive<br/>
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions<br/>
Or sleep with our back turned<br/>
We're supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn<br/>
We're supposed to laugh 'til our hearts stops<br/>
And then we in a space where the dark stops<br/>
And lets love light the way<br/>
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face<br/>
I never wanted another woman to know<br/>
Something about me that you didn't know<br/>
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold<br/>
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over<br/>
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over<br/>
I stew over<br/>
What if?<br/>
You over<br/>
My shit?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hannah Williams:]</i><br/>
I'm never gonna treat you<br/>
Never gonna treat you like I should<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
And if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do<br/>
If they ain't look at me the same<br/>
I would prob'ly die with all the shame<br/>
"You did what with who?"<br/>
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?<br/>
"You risked that for Blue?"<br/>
If I wasn't a superhero in your face<br/>
My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes<br/>
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake<br/>
And you go online and see<br/>
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hannah Williams:]</i><br/>
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
