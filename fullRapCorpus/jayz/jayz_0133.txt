(Are you not entertained?)<br/>
(Are..you..not..entertained?)<br/>
(Is this not why you're here?)<br/>
Uh, Uh, Huh<br/>
Turn the music up<br/>
Turn me down<br/>
Guru...Lets go get 'em again<br/>
This time it's for the money my nigga<br/>
Brooklyn stand up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
There's never been a nigga this good for this long<br/>
This hood<br/>
Or this pop is hot<br/>
Or this strong<br/>
With so many different flows<br/>
This ones for this song<br/>
The next one I'll switch up<br/>
This one will get bit up<br/>
These fucks<br/>
To lazy to make up shit<br/>
They crazy<br/>
They don't...paint pictures<br/>
They just trace me<br/>
You know what<br/>
Soon they forget who they plucked<br/>
They whole style from<br/>
And try to reverse the outcome<br/>
I'm like...CLUCK<br/>
I'm not a biter<br/>
I'm a writer<br/>
For myself and others<br/>
I say a B.I.G. verse I'm only biggin up my brother<br/>
Biggin up my borough<br/>
I'm big enough to do it<br/>
I'm that thorough<br/>
Plus i know my own flow is foolish<br/>
So the rings and things you sing about<br/>
Bring em out<br/>
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth<br/>
I'm in...New sneakers<br/>
Deuce seaters<br/>
A few Diva's<br/>
What more can i tell you<br/>
Let me spell it for you<br/>
W-I-Double L-I-E<br/>
Nobody truer than H-O-V<br/>
And I'm back for more<br/>
New Yorks ambassador<br/>
Prime Minister back to finish my business up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Singing]</i><br/>
What more can i say?<br/>
What more can i do?<br/>
I give this all to you<br/>
I know this much is true<br/>
My Life<br/>
(Look at my life)<br/>
(See what i see)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
You already know what I'm about<br/>
Flying birds down south<br/>
Moving wet off the step<br/>
Purple Rain in the drought<br/>
Stuntin on hoes<br/>
Brushing off my shirt<br/>
But ain't nothing on my clothes<br/>
'Cept my chain<br/>
My name<br/>
Young H-O<br/>
Pitch the yea faithful<br/>
Even if they patrol i make payroll<br/>
Benz paid for<br/>
Friends they roll<br/>
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos<br/>
Chrys case loads<br/>
I don't give a shit<br/>
Nigga one life to live i can't let a day go<br/>
Bye<br/>
Without me being fly<br/>
Fresh to death<br/>
Head to toe until the day i rest<br/>
And i don't wear jerseys I'm thirty plus<br/>
Give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga button ups<br/>
S dots on my feet<br/>
Makes my cycle complete<br/>
What more can i say Guru play the beat, I'm leaving!<br/>
<br/>
We gonna let this ride into the hook<br/>
I'mma snap my fingers on this one<br/>
What more can i say to you?<br/>
Get my grown man on<br/>
LET'S GO<br/>
(What more can i say?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Now you know ass is Willie<br/>
When they got you in a mag<br/>
For like half a Billi<br/>
And your ass ain't Lilly<br/>
White<br/>
That mean that shit you write must be illy<br/>
Either that or your flow is silly<br/>
It's both<br/>
I don't mean to boast<br/>
But damn if i don't brag<br/>
Them crackers gonna act like i ain't on they ads<br/>
The Martha Stewart<br/>
That's far from Jewish<br/>
Far from a Harvard student<br/>
Just had the balls to do it<br/>
And no I'm not through with it<br/>
In fact I'm just previewing it<br/>
This ain't the show I'm just EQ'in it<br/>
One, Two and i won't stop abusing it<br/>
To groupie girls stop false accusing it<br/>
Back to the music<br/>
The mayback roof is translucent<br/>
Niggas got a problem Houston<br/>
What up B<br/>
They can't shut up me<br/>
Shut down I<br/>
Not even P.E.<br/>
I'mma ride<br/>
God forgive me for my brash deivery<br/>
But i remember vivily<br/>
What these streets did to me<br/>
So picture me<br/>
Lettin these clowns nit pick at me<br/>
Paint me like a Pickaninny<br/>
I will literally<br/>
Kiss Tee-Tee in the forhead<br/>
Tell her please forgive me<br/>
Then squeeze until your forhead<br/>
I'm not the one to score points off<br/>
In fact<br/>
I got a joint to knock your points off<br/>
Young<br/>
Hova the God nigga blast for me<br/>
I'm at the Trump International<br/>
Ask for me<br/>
I ain't never scared<br/>
I'm everywhere<br/>
You ain't never there<br/>
Nigga why would i ever care<br/>
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here<br/>
Excluding nobody<br/>
Look what i embody<br/>
The soul of a hustler i really ran the street<br/>
I CEO's mine<br/>
That marketing plan was me<br/>
And no i ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times<br/>
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines<br/>
And i ain't animated, like say a, Busta Rhymes<br/>
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines<br/>
Add that to the fact i went plat a bunch of times<br/>
Times that by my influence<br/>
On pop culture<br/>
I supposed to be number one on everybody's list<br/>
We'll see what happens when i no longer exist<br/>
Fuck this<br/>
<br/>
(What more can i say?)
