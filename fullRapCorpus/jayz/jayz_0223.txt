<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen<br/>
Goddammit<br/>
Let this shit knock<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I done turned Havana to Atlanta<br/>
Guayabera shirts and bandanas<br/>
Every time you think they got me I switch the plan up<br/>
Bulletproof this, radio scanners<br/>
Ballin' 'til they ban us<br/>
You gettin' too much bread, they try to jam you<br/>
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance<br/>
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all appearance<br/>
Politicians never did shit for me<br/>
Except lie to me, distort history<br/>
Wanna give me jail time and a fine<br/>
Fine, let me commit a real crime<br/>
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef<br/>
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets<br/>
Hear the freedom in my speech<br/>
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep<br/>
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free<br/>
Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb<br/>
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat<br/>
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt<br/>
Obama said "chill, you gonna get me impeached"<br/>
But you don't need this shit anyway<br/>
Chill with me on the beach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Y'all gon' learn today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We almost want to start a revolution<br/>
You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting, bark<br/>
Catch a body, head to Houston<br/>
I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans<br/>
This communist talk is so confusing<br/>
When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using<br/>
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music<br/>
You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student<br/>
Oh, you gonna learn today<br/>
Where the fuck have you been<br/>
The world's under new management<br/>
The new role model, fuck this Zoolander sh*t<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Y'all gon' learn today
