<i>[Mariah (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
It's the things that you do<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You know the flow sicka, know Jigga, mo' sicka now right<br/>
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like<br/>
Crazed and demonic, uh without blazin chronic<br/>
Product of Reaganomics<br/>
You know that motherfuckin stoop raised me<br/>
Ringin in da hoops but I was too lazy<br/>
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy<br/>
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z<br/>
Let me explain this to you baby<br/>
I spent nights out, days in<br/>
Niggaz was blazing, twelve noon where I was raised in<br/>
I felt caged in but kept roaming<br/>
Prayed for the Day of Atonement<br/>
Married to the streets no date of annulment<br/>
It seems every time it comes up<br/>
They postpone it<br/>
So I kept my chrome at the waist<br/>
Waiting for the omen<br/>
Savoring the moment and now you know<br/>
The reason that I flow the way I flow baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mariah (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
It's the things that you do<br/>
(Uh, inhale, exhale, breathe on it)<br/>
That make me feel so..<br/>
And I don't know the way I feel<br/>
I can explains<br/>
I love you<br/>
You thug look at what you make the clubs do<br/>
(Bounce, shake, bounce, shake)<br/>
It's the things that you do<br/>
That make me feel so..<br/>
(Uh, exhale, breathe on it for me)<br/>
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain (Uh)<br/>
I love you<br/>
You thug look at what you make the clubs do<br/>
(Drop, bounce, yo)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You know I move like an ounce<br/>
Bottled up like crack<br/>
That's how I make you bounce like that<br/>
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that<br/>
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that<br/>
Trap, trap of my life<br/>
Flashback, kill niggaz<br/>
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga man baby<br/>
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it<br/>
God given, gifts of a soul for hard living<br/>
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom<br/>
Could've been lost in the system<br/>
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm<br/>
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions<br/>
I know I must be part of some mission<br/>
Shit I used take it for granted<br/>
Why they placed me on this planet<br/>
I would ask myself while writin raps to myself<br/>
But right there under my nose<br/>
Was the flow of all flows<br/>
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mariah (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>

I love you<br/>
You thug look at what you make the clubs do<br/>
(Lights out nigga)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You know I've traveled through zones<br/>
Homes spazzed like a bad back<br/>
I came into this game on Jaz's back<br/>
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that<br/>
Yeah I'm here to show and prove<br/>
Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin on Clue<br/>
Whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me<br/>
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy<br/>
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy<br/>
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby<br/>
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?<br/>
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me<br/>
I'mma keep doing me unfortunately<br/>
I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns<br/>
Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son<br/>
Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew<br/>
Y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do<br/>
<br/>
