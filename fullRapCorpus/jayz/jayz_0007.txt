Yeah, hah, yeah Roc-A-Fella<br/>
We invite you to, somethin epic y'all know?<br/>
Where we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness<br/>
Sort of a desperation<br/>
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted<br/>
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to servin<br/>
But we feel we have nothin to lose<br/>
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives,<br/>
What do you bring to the table?<br/>
<br/>
While I'm watchin every nigga watchin me closely<br/>
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me<br/>
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be<br/>
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clapped from close feet<br/>
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days<br/>
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away<br/>
My pain wish it was quick to see, from sellin 'caine<br/>
Til brains was fried to a fricaisse, can't lie<br/>
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar<br/>
Gettin my thug on properly, my squad and me<br/>
Lack of respect for authority, laughin hard<br/>
Happy to be escapin poverty, however brief<br/>
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation<br/>
For dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly<br/>
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill' in<br/>
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William<br/>
Illin for revenues, Rayful Edmonds like<br/>
Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, hand gettin the mic<br/>
Forgettin all I ever knew, convenient amnesia<br/>
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure<br/>
Lock my body can't trap my mind, easily<br/>
Explain why we adapt to crime<br/>
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it<br/>
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it<br/>
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend<br/>
Confidentially speakin in codes since I sense you peekin<br/>
The NSX rental, don't be fooled my game is mental<br/>
We both ride our town dog, what you tryin to get into?<br/>
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables<br/>
Meet me by the one that starts a G up<br/>
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up<br/>
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin margaritas<br/>
Ge-ge-geyeahhh, can I live?<br/>
Can I live?<br/>
<br/>
My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle<br/>
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you<br/>
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me<br/>
Commit atrocities like we got immunity<br/>
You guessed it, manifest it intangible goods<br/>
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease<br/>
We buy the whole car, as you should<br/>
My confederation, dead a nation, EXPLODE<br/>
On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient<br/>
When it boils to steam, it comes to it<br/>
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this<br/>
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish<br/>
Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders<br/>
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a buddhist<br/>
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous, dreams of<br/>
Gettin cream let's do this, it gets te-di-ous<br/>
So I keep one eye open like, C-B-S, ya see me<br/>
Stressed right? Can I live?<br/>
Can I live?<br/>
Can I live?<br/>
Can I live?<br/>
Ha-hah, Roc-A-Fella y'all
