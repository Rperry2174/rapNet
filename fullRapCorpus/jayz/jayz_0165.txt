<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
This is State Of Emergency<br/>
What you want me to do? I'm sorry!<br/>
I'm back..hehehe<br/>
UH, huh uh, lets go get 'em Just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY<br/>
Show me what you got, lil mama<br/>
Show me what you got, pretty lady<br/>
Show me what you got, shorty<br/>
Show me what you got, baby<br/>
Hands up and.. waves, waves, waves, waves<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Give the drummer some<br/>
I already gave the summer some<br/>
It's the winter's turn<br/>
Hovie Hov is the coldest, I'm just getting better with time<br/>
I'm like Opus One<br/>
Young, no two alike like a snowflake<br/>
OK! Show me what you got baby<br/>
Words is slurring engine purring<br/>
Mami fronting but I'm so determined<br/>
Shots of Patron, now she's in the zone<br/>
I ain't talking about the two-three<br/>
Mami in the zone like the homie 2-3<br/>
Jordan or James, makes no difference<br/>
Boo I'm balling the same<br/>
I am the Mike Jordan of recording<br/>
You might want to fallback from recording<br/>
But you right it's not important<br/>
So it forced him to go for the hype<br/>
For being brave and may applaud him<br/>
Well misery I will assure them<br/>
Oh baby just ignore them<br/>
Truth or dare mami listen and learn<br/>
I got a drop I just took off the top, it's your turn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
H.O.V.A., gold bottles of that ace of spade<br/>
Why even fool with these other guys, they all stingy<br/>
All these dudes know how to say is gimme<br/>
Gimme some head, gimme some brain<br/>
Gimme your number, gimme your name<br/>
But if I get one night baby girl I swear<br/>
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here<br/>
I'll take you shopping, take long trips<br/>
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips<br/>
I'll take you there, take my time<br/>
Take you clothes off, I'll take off mine<br/>
Ma, show me what you got<br/>
Hovie in the spot tried to told you I was hot<br/>
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap<br/>
Get the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back!<br/>
Y'all got less than 2 months to get y'all thing together<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen the most incredible!<br/>
H-O, uh huh<br/>
H-O, uh huh<br/>
Is back!<br/>
Justin Blaze<br/>
You Blaze that<br/>
Roc-A-Fella Records<br/>
Dynasty continues, y'all die<br/>
Uh Huh, peace!
