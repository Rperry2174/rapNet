This is a public service announcement<br/>
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records<br/>
<br/>
"Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity<br/>
that I present this recording, as a living testiment and recollection<br/>
of history in the making during our generation."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Allow me to re-introduce myself<br/>
My name is Hov', OH, H-to-the-O-V<br/>
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z<br/>
I guess even back then you can call me<br/>
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov'!<br/>
Fresh out the fryin pan into the fire<br/>
I be the, music biz number one supplier<br/>
Flyer/flier than a piece of paper bearin my name<br/>
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin my chain, that's right<br/>
Hov', OH - not D.O.C.<br/>
But similar to them letters, "No One Can Do it Better"<br/>
I check cheddar like a food inspector<br/>
My homey Strict told me, "Dude finish your breakfast"<br/>
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude<br/>
with the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace<br/>
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this<br/>
I shoot at you actors like movie directors <i>[laughing]</i><br/>
This ain't a movie dog (oh shit)<br/>
<br/>
"Now before I finish, let me just say<br/>
I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you<br/>
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!<br/>
And I don't care WHAT you think about me - but just remember,<br/>
when it hits the fan brother, whether it's next year, ten years, <br/>
twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say<br/>
that these brothers lied to you JACK!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Ving ain't lie<br/>
I done came through the block in everything that's fly<br/>
I'm like, Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex<br/>
I never claimed to have wings on<br/>
Nigga I get mine - by any means on whenever there's a drought<br/>
Get your umbrellas out because, that's when I brainstorm<br/>
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game<br/>
I just rolled the dice, tryin to get some change<br/>
And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me<br/>
lyin as if, I am a different man<br/>
And I could blame my environment but<br/>
there ain't no reason why I be buyin expensive chains<br/>
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers niggaz<br/>
Gettin high within the game<br/>
If you do then, how would you explain?<br/>
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins<br/>
I got a hustler spirit, nigga period<br/>
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it<br/>
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer<br/>
No matter where you go, you are what you are player<br/>
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer<br/>
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here<br/>
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone<br/>
Either love me, or leave me alone
