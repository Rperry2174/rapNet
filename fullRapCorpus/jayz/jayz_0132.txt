<i>[Jay-Z's Mom:]</i><br/>
Sean Carter was born December 4th<br/>
Weighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces<br/>
He was the last of my 4 children<br/>
The only one who didn't give me any pain when i gave birth to him<br/>
And that's how i knew that he was a special child<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z Verse 1]</i><br/>
They say "they never really miss you til you dead or you gone"<br/>
So on that note i'm leaving after the song<br/>
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long<br/>
Atleast let me tell you why i'm this way, Hold on<br/>
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees<br/>
Who made love under the Siccamore tree <br/>
Which makes me<br/>
A more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim<br/>
At 10 pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain<br/>
Although through the years i gave her her fair share<br/>
I gave her her first real scare<br/>
I made it from birth and i got here<br/>
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose<br/>
I ain't perfect i care<br/>
But i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear<br/>
Now i'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there<br/>
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared<br/>
I went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted<br/>
But i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted<br/>
Hold on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z's Mom:]</i><br/>
Shawn was a very shy child growing up<br/>
He was into sports<br/>
And a funny story is<br/>
At 4 he taught hisself how to ride a bike<br/>
A two wheeler at that<br/>
Isn't that special?<br/>
But, i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now all the teachers couldn't reach me<br/>
And my momma couldn't beat me<br/>
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, SO<br/>
With that distain in my membrain<br/>
Got on my pimp game<br/>
Fuck the world my defense came<br/>
Then Dahaven introuced me to the game<br/>
Spanish Jose introduced me to cane<br/>
I'm a hustler now<br/>
My gear is in and i'm in the in crowd<br/>
And all the wavey light skinned girls is lovin me now<br/>
My self esteem went through the roof man i got my swag<br/>
Got a volvo from this girl when her man got bagged<br/>
Plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had<br/>
Supposedly knowin nobody paid Jaz wack ass<br/>
I'm geting ahead of myself, by the way, i could rap<br/>
That came second to me movin this crack<br/>
Gimme a second i swear<br/>
I will say about my rap career<br/>
Til 96 came niggas i'm here<br/>
Good-bye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z's Mom:]</i><br/>
Shawn use to be in the kitchen<br/>
Beating on the table and rapping<br/>
And um, until the wee hours of the morning<br/>
And then i bought him a boom box<br/>
And his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts<br/>
But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z Verse 3]</i><br/>
Good-bye to the game all the spoils, the adreneline rush<br/>
Your blood boils you in a spot knowing cops could rush<br/>
And you in a drop your so easy to touch<br/>
No two days are alike<br/>
Except the first and fifteenth pretty much<br/>
And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us<br/>
Hustlers we don't sleep we rest one eye up<br/>
And the drought to find a man when the well dries up<br/>
You learn to work the water without workin thirst til die YUP<br/>
And niggas get tied up for product<br/>
And little brothers ring fingers get cut up<br/>
To show mothers they really got em<br/>
And this was the stress i live with til i decided<br/>
To try this rap shit for a livin<br/>
I Pray i'm forgiven<br/>
For every bad decision i made<br/>
Every sister i played<br/>
Cause i'm still paranoid to this day<br/>
And it's nobody fault i made the decisions i made<br/>
This is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me<br/>
<br/>
If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack<br/>
Maybe you'll love me when i fade to black<br/>
<br/>
If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack<br/>
Maybe you'll love me when i fade to black<br/>
