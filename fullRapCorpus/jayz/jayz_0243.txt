<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Singing]</i> Whoooh, Paradise<br/>
you better think twice, 'cause you're not living the life<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella y'all, it don't stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
We about to change this game here<br/>
Check my pockets there's nothing but game there<br/>
I remain without fear<br/>
Keep the lanes clear, and the cats that's all about threats remain here<br/>
On top of this Metropolis<br/>
My name is like a square<br/>
Dropped off every tier<br/>
Now y'all can swear to Jay<br/>
Heard it the other day<br/>
Through the mystery, we get it swiftly <br/>
We got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive<br/>
Need cats to live with, the heat goes on<br/>
Everyday is a hustle, the beat goes on<br/>
Funny thing happen, in the midst of chasing money and foes<br/>
And the worst thing worst then getting old is not getting old<br/>
Niggaz stay low, like six bowls of shit and gold <br/>
And watch the hoes when they bump into your clothes<br/>
And I hope they shine<br/>
Seen a lot of things and enough memories to last me two lifetimes<br/>
Can't knock the hustle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus #1: (Singing)]</i><br/>
I'm taking out this time<br/>
To give you a piece of my mind<br/>
Who do you think you are <br/>
Baby one day you'll be a star<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Check this<br/>
In a mans world need a girl to tough something<br/>
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something<br/>
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something<br/>
When I get home<br/>
Then it's on<br/>
Girl just crack those shaped legs like Grade A eggs<br/>
Love the way you behave and beg<br/>
Moan, turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team<br/>
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens (226)<br/>
Life with me, consists of a lot of things<br/>
Chips in your ear hit the dirt 'cause you got hotter things<br/>
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness<br/>
Remind them freak chicks to stay out my business<br/>
You know they can't love it, trips to LA with no luggage<br/>
Came back with six bags struggling<br/>
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me<br/>
Bank still off on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus #2: (Singing)]</i><br/>
But until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy<br/>
'Cause that's the way you making me feel (can't knock the hustle)<br/>
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance<br/>
Can't knock the hustle for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Ever since you retired, working alongside those live wires<br/>
Been in this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars<br/>
I guess I'm biased, what I talk about I live<br/>
These rap dudes can flip, but some of them ain't even rhyming for chips<br/>
WHAT PART OF THE GAME IS THIS<br/>
Seems brainless, on tours with whores that's what I'm saying I miss<br/>
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques<br/>
Starting out with four jacks, ended up with Gold Ac's<br/>
Bet your love collapses if my funds get trapped<br/>
On the weight of me through you, screw you<br/>
Gun blew you, I didn't want to choose you<br/>
Run through you like UH, EXCUSE YOU!<br/>
But that's my cash, I understand you hustle<br/>
That's my cash, you don't understand<br/>
Let my dough flash, you can show it love<br/>
Like a rap star in front of the club<br/>
But don't knock the hustle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 &amp; 2 to fade]</i>
