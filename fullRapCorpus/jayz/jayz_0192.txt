<i>[Jay-Z Talking]</i><br/>
Blueprint trios<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah Yeah What we talkin' bout real shit?<br/>
Or we talkin' bout ryhmes<br/>
You talkin' bout millions Or you talking' bout mine<br/>
What we talkin' bout Cuz I ain't got time<br/>
For what people be talkin' bout all the time<br/>
What we talkin' bout fiction Or we talkin bout fact<br/>
You talkin' bout fiction? Hold up pardon my back<br/>
I'm talkin' bout life And all I hear is<br/>
Oh yeah he keeps talkin' bout crack<br/>
I ain't talkin' bout profit I'm talkin' bout pain<br/>
I'm talkin' bout despair I'm talkin' bout shame<br/>
I ain't talkin' bout gossip I ain't talkin' bout Game<br/>
I ain't talkin bout Jimmy I ain't talkin' bout Dame<br/>
I'm talkin' bout real shit Dem people playin'<br/>
What is you talkin' bout I don't know what y'all sayin'<br/>
People keep talkin' bout Hov take it back<br/>
I'm doin' better than before Why would I do that?<br/>
Ain't nothing cool bout carryin' a strap<br/>
Bout worryin' your moms And buryin' your best cat<br/>
Talkin' bout revenge While carryin' his casket<br/>
All teary-eyed Bout to take it to a matress<br/>
I'm talkin' bout music I ain't talkin' bout rap<br/>
You talkin' bout who's hot I ain't talkin' bout that<br/>
The conversation is changed Lets yap about that<br/>
I don't run rap no more I run the map<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
They Talk, We Live, We see what They say, They say, They say<br/>
They Talk, We Did, Who cares what They say, They say, They say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Still they can't' focus on them They be talkin' bout me<br/>
Talkin' bout what I wear Talkin' bout where I be<br/>
Check out my hair These ain't curls these is peas<br/>
Peasey head still get paid I'm combin' through G's<br/>
Please, We ain't focused on naps<br/>
Cuz I don't run rap no more I run the map<br/>
A small part of the reason the President is black<br/>
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack<br/>
Talkin' bout progress I ain't lookin back<br/>
You know I run track Try not to get lapped<br/>
People keep talkin' bout Hov left em flat<br/>
Try to re-write history Lets talk about facts<br/>
Dame made millions Even Jaz made some scraps<br/>
He could've made more But he didn't sign his contract<br/>
As far as street guys We was dealin' crack<br/>
That's just how the game goes I don't owe nobody jack<br/>
Grown men want me to sit em on my lap<br/>
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black<br/>
I repeat, You can't sit on my lap<br/>
I don't have a beard Now get off my sack<br/>
Scream at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Blueprint 3<br/>
And now that that's that Lets talk about the future<br/>
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther<br/>
Now you could choose ta Sit in front of your computa<br/>
Posin' with guns Shootin YouTube up<br/>
Or you could come with me to the White House get your suit up<br/>
You stuck on being hardcore I chuck the duece up<br/>
Peace out Medusa<br/>
Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah Tre piece Jay-Z your tutor<br/>
Toota of my own horn Beep beep move-ya<br/>
Ras clot when rude boy come through with the roof up<br/>
So I could see the sky<br/>
Cause everybody talkin' Hov I think we know why<br/>
<br/>
