<i>[Swizz Beats - Chorus]</i><br/>
I got a million ways to get it<br/>
Choose one (choose one)<br/>
Hey, bring it back (bring it back)<br/>
Now double your money and make a stack<br/>
<br/>
I’m on to the next one<br/>
On to the next one<br/>
On to the next one<br/>
On to the next one<br/>
On to the next one<br/>
On to the next one<br/>
On to the next one<br/>
<br/>
Hold up, freeze<br/>
<br/>
Somebody bring me back some money please,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hov on that new shit n-ggas like how come<br/>
N-ggas want my old sh-t, buy my old album<br/>
N-ggas stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it moving<br/>
N-ggas make the same sh-t, me I make the blueprint<br/>
<br/>
Came in Range, hopped out the Lexus<br/>
every year since i’ve bin on that next sh-t<br/>
traded in the gold for the platinum rolex’s<br/>
Now a n-gga wrist match the status of my records<br/>
<br/>
Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner<br/>
Now I rock a teller suit looking like a owner<br/>
No I'm not a Jonus brother I’m a grown up<br/>
No I’m not a virgin I use my cahonas<br/>
<br/>
I move forward the only direction<br/>
cant be scared to fail Search and perfection<br/>
Gotta keep it fresh even when we sexing<br/>
but don’t be mad at him when he’s on to the next one<br/>
<br/>
Freeze<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
F-ck a throwback jersey cos we on to the next one,<br/>
and f-ck that autotune cos we oohhhhn,<br/>
and n-ggas don’t be mad cos it’s all about progression,<br/>
loiterers should be arrested, I used to drink Kristal,<br/>
muthaf-ckers racist, so I switched Gold Bottles on to that spade sh-t,<br/>
you gon have another drink or you just gon babysit,<br/>
on to the next one, somebody call da waitress,<br/>
Baby i’m a boss, i dunno what they do,<br/>
I don’t get dropped, I dropped the label,<br/>
World can’t hold me, too much ambition,<br/>
always knew it’d be like this when I was in the kitchen,<br/>
n-ggas in the same spots, me I’m dodging rain drops,<br/>
meaning i’m on vacay, chillin on a big yacht,<br/>
yeah i go ton flip flops, white louie boat shoes,<br/>
you should grow the f-ck up,<br/>
come here let me coach you,<br/>
Hold up,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Uh, Big pimpin in the house now,<br/>
bought the land, tore the muthaf-cking house down,<br/>
bought the car, tore the muthaf-cking roof off,<br/>
ride clean, i don’t ever take the shoes off,<br/>
bought the jeep, tore the muthaf-cking doors off,<br/>
foot out dat b-tch about to sh-t like a skateboard,<br/>
navigation on tryin to find my next thrill,<br/>
feelin myself i don’t even need an x pill,<br/>
can’t chill but my neck will,<br/>
haters really gon be mad off my next deal,<br/>
uh, i dont know hwy they really worry bout my pockets,<br/>
meanwhile i had Oprah chillin in the projects,<br/>
had her out in Bed Stuy chillin on the steps,<br/>
drinking quarter waters gotta be the best,<br/>
MJ at summerjam, Obama on the text,<br/>
y’all should be afraid of what I’m gonna do next.<br/>
Hold up,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
