Ha Ha<br/>
You're wasting your talent, Randy<br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back<br/>
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br/>
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br/>
It's like the face inside is right <br/>
<br/>
Why does it feel like night today?<br/>
Something inside's not right today.<br/>
Why am I so uptight today?<br/>
Paranoia's all I got left<br/>
I don't know what stressed me first<br/>
Or how the pressure was fed<br/>
But I know just what it feels like<br/>
To have a voice in the back of my head<br/>
Like a face that I hold inside<br/>
A face that awakes when I close my eyes<br/>
A face watches every time I lie<br/>
A face that laughs every time I fall<br/>
And watches everything<br/>
<br/>
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim<br/>
That the face inside is hearing me<br/>
Right beneath my skin <br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back<br/>
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br/>
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br/>
It's like the face inside is right<br/>
<br/>
You know I - thug em, fuck em, love em, leave em<br/>
Cause I don't fuckin need em<br/>
Take em out the hood, keep em lookin good<br/>
But I don't fuckin feed em<br/>
First time they fuss I'm breezin<br/>
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?"<br/>
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch<br/>
Better trust than believe em<br/>
In the cut where I keep em<br/>
til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts<br/>
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up<br/>
Let em play with the dick in the truck<br/>
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs<br/>
Divorce him and split his bucks<br/>
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread<br/>
so you can be livin it up? Shit I..<br/>
parts with nothin, y'all be frontin<br/>
Me give my heart to a woman?<br/>
Not for nothin, never happen<br/>
I'll be forever mackin<br/>
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion<br/>
I got no patience<br/>
And I hate waitin..<br/>
Hoe get yo' ass in<br/>
<br/>
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now<br/>
RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah<br/>
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now<br/>
RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah<br/>
<br/>
We doin.. big pimpin, we spendin G's<br/>
Check em out now<br/>
Big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s<br/>
We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.<br/>
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B<br/>
Yo yo yo.. big pimpin, spendin G's<br/>
We doin - big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s<br/>
We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.<br/>
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B (b...)
