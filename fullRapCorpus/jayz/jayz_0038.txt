<i>[Foxy Brown]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, uh-huh<br/>
Uhh (paper chase)<br/>
Bonnie n Clyde<br/>
Y'all motherfuckers know how it's goin down<br/>
(gotta get that paper y'all)<br/>
That's right, uhh<br/>
(Uh-huh uh, yeah, Roc-a-Fella, yeah<br/>
Paper chase y'all, paper chase WHAT? Uh)<br/>
<br/>
Greyhound bitch, stay down bitch<br/>
Bout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch<br/>
Half a brick of yea, bout to lay down this bitch<br/>
(til November?) Nah, I'm here to like slay down this bitch<br/>
What you think? I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch<br/>
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch<br/>
I'm tryin to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch<br/>
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six<br/>
Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch<br/>
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch<br/>
Gotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here <br/>
for all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters<br/>
I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya<br/>
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya<br/>
Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya<br/>
If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (That's right!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Foxy, Jay-Z]</i><br/>
<i>[F]</i> Gotta get that paper dog<br/>
<i>[F]</i> Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Gotta get that paper dog<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Gotta have that grab that paper dog!<br/>
<i>[F]</i> Gotta get that paper dog<br/>
<i>[F]</i> Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Gotta get that paper dog<br/>
<i>[J]</i> When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones<br/>
A down ass bitch and she down to click<br/>
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with<br/>
And my plan is, not to leave this town til I'm rich<br/>
Gotta find a nigga sellin all them ounces and shit<br/>
Tell them get down with the click or get found in a ditch<br/>
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit<br/>
Not to hit em, just to let em know the sound of shit<br/>
Return later that evening in the club with Fox<br/>
And I got the snub nosed for those that love to box<br/>
I'm in search of them young niggaz that hug the block<br/>
all day, til it's like gray outside<br/>
Shoot dice talkin shit all day outside<br/>
And even when it's hot, they outside<br/>
Let em know, how it's gon' go, Bonnie n Clyde<br/>
And aiyyo, you will want me on your side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best<br/>
I ain't got it to give but I got it to test<br/>
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest<br/>
is your time, I gotta move this in a, week or less<br/>
For the next couple of days I brought her all I posess<br/>
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS<br/>
Twin to drive in the passenger with a TV rest<br/>
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS<br/>
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team<br/>
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed em the cream<br/>
Picked em up in the afternoons and told em some things<br/>
You know the regular shit you do when you moldin them teens<br/>
Yo, never lay your head where you holdin them things<br/>
From family, to your business, nothing goes in between<br/>
Never feared no man, put four in his Beem<br/>
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
