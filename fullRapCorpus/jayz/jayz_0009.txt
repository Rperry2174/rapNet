Check one check two, you know what to do<br/>
Primo, cold crush when I give it to you<br/>
Friend or foe yo, state your biz<br/>
Ya tend to dough, ah, there it is<br/>
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids<br/>
Don't like nobody commin around here fuckin wit they doe for shit<br/>
You enterprisin though,<br/>
And I like it<br/>
But fuck with the big dogs though, I gotta bite ya,<br/>
Look, its out of my hands<br/>
And you gettin money round here, its not in the plans<br/>
So hop yo ass out of that van, head back to kansas<br/>
I'm sendin niggas back up in campuses<br/>
Chance is slimmer than that chick in calvin klien pantses<br/>
Let me guess, they said it was money round here<br/>
And the rest is me stoppin you from gettin it, correct?<br/>
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel<br/>
I'll take care of that, you'll see, now please<br/>
Give me the room key<br/>
You're twitchin, don't do that, you makin me nervous<br/>
My crew, well, they do pack, them niggas is murderous<br/>
So would ya, please put your hand back in sight<br/>
They don't like to see me nervous you can understand that, right?<br/>
You draw, better be picasso, y'know the best<br/>
Cause if this is not so, ah, god bless<br/>
You leave me no choice, I leave you no voice<br/>
Believe me son I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done <br/>
Now calm your boys, <br/>
Cause I'm findin it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise<br/>
Get the point, I'll let ya go, <br/>
Before ya leave, I guess I aughta let you know, I need those keys<br/>
And promise you never, no matter the weather<br/>
Evaevaevaevaevaevaevaevaeva come around here no mo'
