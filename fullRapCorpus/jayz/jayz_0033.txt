<i>[Jay-Z (first four lines overlap the section above)]</i><br/>
Can't fuck with me<br/>
They ain't ready yet<br/>
Uh-huh uh-huh<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit em wit, numerous<br/>
shots with the fo'-fo'<br/>
Faggots wanna talk to Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa<br/>
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload<br/>
Fuck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed<br/>
Left holes through some guy clothes<br/>
Stop your bullshittin, glock with the full clip<br/>
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit<br/>
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip<br/>
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit<br/>
Oh hey ma, how you, know niggaz wanna buy you<br/>
But see me I wanna _Fuck for Free_ like Akinyele<br/>
Now I gotta let her take this ride, make you feel it<br/>
inside your belly, if it's tight get the K-Y Jelly<br/>
All night get you wide up inside the telly<br/>
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (with Amil-lion)]</i><br/>

Recognize bitch, Jay to the motherfuckin Z<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Got a condo with nuttin but condoms in it<br/>
The same place where the rhymes is invented<br/>
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke<br/>
See how I was flowin on my last cassette?<br/>
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a Tec, never jam though<br/>
Never get high, never run out of ammo<br/>
Niggaz hatin n shit cause I slayed your bitch<br/>
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick<br/>
And now you're, actin raw but you never had war<br/>
Don't know how to carry your hoe, wanna marry your hoe<br/>
Now she's mad at me, causer Your Majesty, just happened to be<br/>
A pimp with a tragedy<br/>
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked with friends<br/>
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again<br/>
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, "Shit..<br/>
there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (with variation in last line)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Gotta vendetta even though I been better<br/>
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater<br/>
Rap niggaz on Prozac get the bozack, niggaz threw<br/>
two at me I threw fo' back, hold that<br/>
Let the dough stack, way before Big had the gold Ac'<br/>
Dame had the Lex black<br/>
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that<br/>
And right where you're stressed, where you rest at<br/>
I suggest that, niggaz invest, in a vest, when I come through<br/>
with the glock jet black, you niggaz step back<br/>
I'm the best at, you know I ain't no apprentice to this<br/>
Me and my niggaz we invented the shit<br/>
I came into the business with this, The Originator, non greater<br/>
Jaz-O finish this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Jaz]</i><br/>
Better learn, Jaz'll relax that, ever heard of me?<br/>
Worldwide Originator, say word to me<br/>
The population holla certainly, I burn a nigga<br/>
like a third degree, see me shine so bright<br/>
Nigga I'm my light, runnin rulin with rigor and vigor<br/>
Nobody bigger than me and my nigga Jigga<br/>
You fly-by-nights stop chirpin B<br/>
Heavyweights type work to me<br/>
For the time, in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurtin me<br/>
What? Cut your face in like surgery<br/>
Who the fuck got a VS, fuckin BM's on the road<br/>
when you had to be in bed at the PM<br/>
Need the info, Jaz on the C-N-N<br/>
forever touchin my workers beginnin you're endin<br/>
Nigga your style's no style my style's hostile<br/>
C'mon, faggot nigga down to take the gun home<br/>
