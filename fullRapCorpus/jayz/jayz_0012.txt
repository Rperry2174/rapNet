<i>[Sauce Money]</i><br/>
Aiyyo Jay word up; these motherfuckers<br/>
Fuckin talkin that comeback shit like they cookin crack<br/>
Shit I ain't frontin all I want my pockets green like slum change<br/>
Yaknahmsayin? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers motherfucker<br/>
For real; with no trace of AIDS<br/>
We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella click nigga<br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo we pattin down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar<br/>
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car<br/>
We got the bad bitches gaspin for air in Aspen<br/>
Searchin for aspirin when I ask then, we swing<br/>
You cling we do our thing and bring<br/>
Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing<br/>
East coast hostess hostile colossal, money flarin<br/>
like nostrils for drug dealin apostles, huh<br/>
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown<br/>
Me Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like poquino<br/>
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full<br/>
Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull<br/>
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys<br/>
with my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese<br/>
Said we was garbage, so fuck college<br/>
Street knowledge amazin to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars<br/>
Star studded bitches with cristals, get fucked with pistols<br/>
just to see my shit, discharge puss<br/>
I drop the stellar, even acapella<br/>
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Fat Joe]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang<br/>
And if not then let me do my thang<br/>
<i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent spanish wisdoms<br/>
in a whip with dinero, crime organized like the pharoah<br/>
I cream, I diamond gleam<br/>
High post like Akiem, got a lot of things to drop<br/>
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam<br/>
Niggaz wanna try to hem my long jeans<br/>
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene<br/>
In the meanwhile, here's somethin dope for y'all to lean<br/>
Liason for days on in<br/>
Money make the world go around so I made songs to spin<br/>
Can I Live, did dough, with my nigs, dividends flow<br/>
like the Mississippi riv', lookin jig'<br/>
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo<br/>
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto<br/>
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson<br/>
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano<br/>
you ain't ready, I find no trigger straight up shoot my guns<br/>
horizontal, get your weight up, I am<br/>
two point two pounds you're barely a hundred and twenty-five grams<br/>
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money<br/>
Do the knowledge, do the few dollars, I'm due to demolish<br/>
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck...<br/>
<br/>
"Bring it on if you think you can hang..." - <i>[Fat Joe]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Jaz]</i><br/>
Money is power<br/>
I'm into cheddick with facial credit<br/>
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars<br/>
Spread letters you move you're deadish<br/>
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes<br/>
You suck pistol like pipe with the cristal<br/>
John Stockton couldn't assist you<br/>
Cowboys or Benzes like we foulin in the U.N.<br/>
So what the fuck you doin?<br/>
Whatever nigga Fahrvegnugen, rugged yet polished<br/>
Spankin dollars with the commas<br/>
bangin bitches out the Bahamas<br/>
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly frather<br/>
Fry hotter, you die gotta<br/>
Fuck with me witness manana<br/>
Absence of malice in my palace<br/>
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callous<br/>
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggaz off balance<br/>
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feedin me<br/>
Steam a nigga schemin on the wrist action with the gleams<br/>
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams<br/>
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, bring it on... bring it on..." - <i>[Fat Joe]</i><br/>
<i>[repeat 5X]</i>
