<i>[Intro: Eastbound &amp; Down (Kenny Powers)]</i><br/>
The only thing I'm seeing I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins.<br/>
You know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins.<br/>
We gonna have so many fucking fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof.<br/>
Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Soulja Boy]</i><br/>
We made it<br/>
We made it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]</i><br/>
The devil, the haters, the bloggers, the papers, the labels, they labeled me<br/>
But they can't relate to our struggle, my nigga, we came up from slavery<br/>
Apologies go out to all of my fans cause they waited so patiently<br/>
This one is for all of the lost and forgotten black angels that prayed for me<br/>
A milli, a milli, niggas love me cause I'm ill<br/>
The greatest story ever told, niggas in the field<br/>
From Solomon to Sambo to Django, it's fact<br/>
I'm the Farrakhan of rap and I get it from the wheel<br/>
The son of WD, who hung around in the D<br/>
Who ran around in the three<br/>
The trap gods raised me<br/>
Face all on the Sphinx<br/>
Story all in the wall of the pyramids<br/>
Niggas know the Black God saved me<br/>
You can blow the nose off, that won't change it<br/>
Obamacare won't heal all that anguish<br/>
We came a long way from the bottom of the boat<br/>
All praise to the Mahdi, we found our language<br/>
Gold necklace, middle finger erected<br/>
God tribe of Shabazz stylin' on the record<br/>
Lost sons of Muhammad, wildin' in the wreckage<br/>
Asha du illah illaha is the message<br/>
All these niggas, I got to fight one<br/>
All these devils, I got to strike some<br/>
All these rebels just waitin' on the war cry<br/>
Mama said "Son, you got to strike drum"<br/>
Roc Nation, celebration<br/>
Motivation, elevation<br/>
Nigga we made it from slaves on a slaveship<br/>
Live from the cotton fields, straight to the spaceship<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Kenny Powers]</i><br/>
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down.<br/>
Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hop off the slave ship<br/>
Poppin' my chain, and took it to Jacob, I got it gold plated<br/>
Walked in that bitch like "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
I own my own masters, you know I ain't missin' no royalty statements<br/>
I can't be rated, damn Hov stunt on them haters<br/>
Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk<br/>
Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought<br/>
While these rappers rap about guns they ain't shot<br/>
And a bunch of other silly shit that they ain't got<br/>
I'm on my Lupita Nyong'o<br/>
Stuntin' on stage, got the 12 Years A Slave<br/>
This Ace of Spades look like an Oscar<br/>
Black tux, look like a mobster<br/>
Don't make me RRRRAA yah, nigga watch your tone<br/>
I come to court with black boxers on<br/>
Y'all hella jealous of my melatonin<br/>
I could black out at any given moment<br/>
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made<br/>
So when my arms &amp; feet shackled I still get paid<br/>
All praises due<br/>
I'm ready to chase the Yakub back into caves<br/>
These are the last days, but do I seem fazed?<br/>
Showed up to the last supper in some brand new J's<br/>
I'm the true and livin', book of Hov<br/>
New religion, 8th wonder of the world, alien, superstition<br/>
You're blind, baby<br/>
Blind to the fact of who you are maybe<br/>
My bloodline's crazy<br/>
Kings and queens and Michael Jordan rings<br/>
I go stupido, sucio<br/>
The flow is filthy, y'all can't kill me<br/>
I've been inoculated from the snakes and the fakes<br/>
The corny handshakes, cock sucker we made it
