<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass<br/>
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass<br/>

<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Coming up, coming down<br/>
Riding clean fix your head in my crown<br/>
Bad bitch, H town<br/>
Keep it trill y'all know y'all can't fuck around<br/>
Paris where we been<br/>
'Pard my Parisian<br/>
It's Hov time in no time<br/>
It's fuck all y'all season<br/>
It's Bordeauxs and Burgundies<br/>
Flush out a Riesling<br/>
When's Hov's out, those hoes out<br/>
Y'all put y'all weaves in<br/>
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass<br/>
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass<br/>
Spent all my euros<br/>
On tuxes and weird clothes<br/>
I party with weirdoes<br/>
Yeah Hov, yeah Hov<br/>

Pardon my laughing y'all only flagging on beats nigga<br/>
Pardon my laughing I happen to think you sweet<br/>
