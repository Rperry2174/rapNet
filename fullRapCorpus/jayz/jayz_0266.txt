<i>[Intro: Swizz Beats]</i><br/>
Swizzy...Beats...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Aiyo I cannot (Stop), I will not (Stop)<br/>
AS WE PROCEED<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Young Hov got the block on smash<br/>
Put the gun to the back and hop on some ass<br/>
Nigga fresh-dressed and stay poppin' tags<br/>
Put the (?) on the truck 'for I drop the rag<br/>
Bitches want to bring up the topic of my past<br/>
It's legendary in the hood how I got my cash<br/>
I'm legendady in the hood so I got the mag<br/>
And I've never been a fronter so I've got to blast<br/>
Will I flash... Not...<br/>
As I'm not playing with you motherfuckers the casket drops<br/>
You bastards not gon' assassinate the name I got<br/>
Ya'll hear me though<br/>
Young Hov got the block on smash<br/>
And everybody and their momma want to stop my cash<br/>
Everybody want drama with the top of the brass<br/>
'Til I come through hop out the cab<br/>
1-8-7 they ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
(Stop) Somebody 'gon (Drop) Ya'll hear me though...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Young Hov got the game in a frenzy<br/>
Twenty million sold all independently<br/>
So when you mention me<br/>
Make sure you got together your 'semblies<br/>
Like "he's the games J.F.Kennedy"<br/>
I started out I ain't have no chimney<br/>
My ma was Santa Claus, well at least she pretended to be<br/>
'Til one night, well that's if memory serves me correct I caught her under<br/>
the Christmas tree<br/>
Young Hov ain't have no pops<br/>
Thank God man I had the block<br/>
Ya'll hear me though<br/>
You young fucks got the game all wrong<br/>
This is my life man this ain't no song<br/>
You ain't livin' your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house<br/>
In that tight-ass room, pullin' the cars out<br/>
And the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself<br/>
You American Pie, stop feeling yourself<br/>
Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself<br/>
Stop being a server, get a meal yourself<br/>
Where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of your gats<br/>
We got bigger ones<br/>
How many niggas done shot at me shivering<br/>
They were so scared they ain't hit me once<br/>
Young Hov 'bout to go to the range<br/>
'Bout to work on perfecting my aim<br/>
Ya'll dont hear me though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
