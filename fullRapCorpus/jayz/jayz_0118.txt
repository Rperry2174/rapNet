Can you hear me now?  Good!  (Blueprint 2 baby!)<br/>
The best of times, it was the worst of times (aoww)<br/>
It's "The Gift &amp; the Curse"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
R.O.C. YEAH, number one click HERE<br/>
If you represent US, throw them diamonds up YEAH<br/>
Now let's be CLEAR, I ain't goin no-WHERE<br/>
Now that you KNOW, holla at your boy<br/>
HOV'.. (Hov', Hov', Hov')<br/>
(Hov', Hov', Hov', Hov')<br/>
<br/>
<i>[overlapping first Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah, Roc-A-Fella Records<br/>
You know what diamond is<br/>
We ain't goin nowhere, put your diamonds up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Standin in my b-boy stance<br/>
Free, Beans, Memphis where you at nigga?<br/>
(Right here) Snatch Cam and it's a rap<br/>
This here rap belong to us, nobody strong as us, it's a fact<br/>
Hold up I'm just warmin up, gimme a second to get it back<br/>
Young Chris, Neek what?  Oschino and Sparks<br/>
Next summer's yo' summer, tear this motherfucker up<br/>
Young is eternal, my young'uns'll burn you<br/>
"The Blueprint" birthed, nigga I earthed you, you can't be serious<br/>
Young cause I'm thirty-two, dressed like I'm twenty-two<br/>
Flow like a 18, do what I wanna do<br/>
Goin on my 8th ring, got Phil Jackson's and<br/>
flow is black magic, I'm at it again<br/>
Rose Bowl with black karats, "Horse &amp; Carriage" to spend<br/>
like Mason Betha, chasin this cheddar, to the end<br/>
of the road because the end I'm told is nearer than we know<br/>
What can I say but live for today, HOV'!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, "The Blueprint 2" homey, follow the moves<br/>
You put on two tube socks, you couldn't walk in my shoes<br/>
I was dealt a bad hand, fuck what else could I do<br/>
but keep somethin up my sleeve that'll help me through<br/>
But can you believe, everywhere I'm at, models come through<br/>
Cat-fightin, cat-walkin, it happens often<br/>
It's true how society don't want me to move<br/>
into the penthouse building with spectacular views<br/>
They're like uhh, "He's a menace he could never be a tenant"<br/>
I'm like ooh, what's a young nigga to do?<br/>
I bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that I don't<br/>
give a fuck we just chillin watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck<br/>
Old lady, don't blow my high<br/>
'specially if you don't know my life, don't make me bring<br/>
Sharpton in it cause I'm dark-skinneded or<br/>
dude with the 'fro and the Rainbow Coalition, I'ma<br/>
victim of a single parent household, born in a mousehole<br/>
Mousetrap, niggaz wanna know<br/>
How so, how Jay get up out that, here, yeah<br/>
I snatched purses I per-se-vered, yeah<br/>
I had work, fiends purchased, it was clear<br/>
I was out there sellin hope for despair, but stop there<br/>
I swear, I only make good from my mouth to God's ears<br/>
Had to get out the hood<br/>
And I can't justify genocide<br/>
But I was born in the city where the skinny niggaz die<br/>
Born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride<br/>
And as a skinny nigga I had beef with high size<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
