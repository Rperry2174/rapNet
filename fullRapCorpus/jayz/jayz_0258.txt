<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up<br/>
I'm trying to make, all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta<br/>
say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow<br/>
I found a new route, you bout to see my life change<br/>
I make the means justify the ends, I make the cream<br/>
materialize keys to a Benz, and so I'm rollin<br/>
For now, holdin down the fort, who's controllin?<br/>
The ground's gotta blow em, yep, y'all shoulda told em<br/>
Uhh, my first felony's approachin, copped my first key<br/>
Took a freeze, now I'm frozen<br/>
I bought a black Mac, I'm outta control<br/>
Losin bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know<br/>
it always crossed my mind that Feds be tappin the lines like Gregory Hines<br/>
Still on the phone discussin my biz like it could never be mines<br/>
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs, and the rights<br/>
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?<br/>
<i>[scratched "In my lifetime"]</i><br/>
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?<br/>
<i>[scratched "In my lifetime"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin cold cash<br/>
The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr<br/>
Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin God<br/>
Is this, world my world, am I the star of stars?<br/>
Baby pimped out, I'm gettin too large and smokin cigars<br/>
All chicks is hollerin bout chica, the whole city's buzzin<br/>
wasn't checkin for me a dozen or so, months ago<br/>
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person<br/>
Lettin the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar<br/>
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's<br/>
I'm talkin big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these, uhh<br/>
Give me a rush like you wouldn't believe, my head's about to bust<br/>
Acceleratin what drives me, hope I don't gotta die<br/>
to see, see I can't lie to me<br/>
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights<br/>
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, from the beginning see we never seen the ending<br/>
Running up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh<br/>
We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's<br/>
Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly but that's cool<br/>
as I, zone in the Al Capone, watch me<br/>
cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone<br/>
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody, when I recite em<br/>
Bones get disconnected like the phones<br/>
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game<br/>
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden<br/>
Still the drill makes me blind to the fact<br/>
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner, of my crimes<br/>
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights<br/>
Now I'm, incarcerate for my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x5: to fade]</i>
