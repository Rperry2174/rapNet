<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I thought this was America people!<br/>
Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?<br/>
That's how we workin huh? Okay<br/>
Before me there was many; after me there will be none<br/>
I am the one<br/>
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I get it down - anxiously the public can't wait<br/>
Niggaz had to have it way before it's release date<br/>
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up<br/>
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight<br/>
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape<br/>
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate<br/>
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind<br/>
that what's mine is mine, nobody get to take<br/>
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down<br/>
My mental rolodex see these words? I just don't know<br/>
I know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama<br/>
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor<br/>
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most<br/>
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin with toast<br/>
I ain't tryin to collide with folk, <br/>
but I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke<br/>
I guess you niggaz just woke - good morning!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - R. Kelly]</i><br/>
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me<br/>
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty<br/>
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty<br/>
I got, all, my mamis<br/>
I've got all of my mamis<br/>
Tell me, what you, want from me<br/>
Tell me.. what y'all want from me?<br/>
I'm not guilty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I see how you comin at me now, I'm cool<br/>
<br/>
I'm not the snitch I don't go to the cops to get rich<br/>
.. I go to the block and pitch<br/>
I go with the glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick<br/>
I go with you hard; I ain't gon' stop for shit<br/>
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils<br/>
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?<br/>
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbin my game<br/>
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indichted<br/>
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it<br/>
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in<br/>
Y'all all knnow it, Jigga's a fighter<br/>
Plus I'm clausterphobic, back on the streets before you know it<br/>
And my word niggaz, I heard you niggaz<br/>
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers<br/>
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever<br/>
B.I.G. is here, the soul of Tupac hovers - above us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - R. Kelly]</i><br/>
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me<br/>
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty<br/>
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty<br/>
I got, all, my mamis<br/>
I've got all of my mamis<br/>
Tell me, what you, want from me<br/>
Tell me.. (I am the one)<br/>
What you want from me? Not guilty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch<br/>
<br/>
Got lame bitches tryin to fuck with my case<br/>
Same lame bitch I bust in her face<br/>
Honey just mad I got her fuckin replaced<br/>
Plus a birthday pass without me even touchin my safe<br/>
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick<br/>
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch<br/>
You heart the rhetorhic, Jigga hit me over the head<br/>
with a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?<br/>
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain<br/>
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?<br/>
I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change<br/>
For nothin else, you gotta live with yourself<br/>
Try and lie on Hov' cause I ride on the road<br/>
in what, most would describe as a Rolls<br/>
NO, that's that Continental T<br/>
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - R. Kelly]</i><br/>
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me<br/>
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty<br/>
And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty<br/>
I got, all, my mamis<br/>
(I am the one) I've got all of my mamis<br/>
Tell me, what you, want from me<br/>
Tell me.. what you want from me?<br/>
Not guilty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I, am, the, one<br/>
<i>[R]</i><br/>
Y'all, cats, can't touch me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
So you can't touch me nigga, you can't touch me<br/>
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty<br/>
Said Jigga, Kelly, not guilty<br/>
I got, all, my mamis<br/>
And I got, all my, mamis<br/>
Tell me, what you, want from me<br/>
I don't, know why, y'all can't see that<br/>
Y'all, cats, can't touch me<br/>
Y'all, dudes, can't touch me<br/>
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty<br/>
