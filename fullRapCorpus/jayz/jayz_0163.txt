<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
<br/>
Pops sped off<br/>
Left Mom with a bundle of<br/>
Joy ya boy<br/>
Smack dab in the jungle<br/>
Took tunnel vision<br/>
But he would soon become a mogul<br/>
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo<br/>
Don't play with my yo-yo<br/>
Loco niggas in the hood<br/>
First niggas hating on me<br/>
It's all good<br/>
I'm buying things like my sh*t don't stink<br/>
Gucci links and Gucci gooses<br/>
Watching too many movies<br/>
Bulletproof this<br/>
Had some nerve<br/>
Like pulling tooths<br/>
When you sixteen, coming through roofless<br/>
Yeah ya boy ruthless<br/>
Like Ice Cube was<br/>
Turn the whole city on<br/>
I'm the new plug<br/>
So if this is your first time hearing this<br/>
You are about to experience someone so cold<br/>
A journey seldom seen<br/>
The American dream<br/>
From the bottom to the top of the globe<br/>
They call me HOV<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
They gunning for me<br/>
Wanna see me fall<br/>
You know my story<br/>
I been through it all<br/>
Nights I felt like dying<br/>
But I ain't crying<br/>
What didn't kill me<br/>
Made me strong as iron<br/>
I am<br/>
I am<br/>
Oh my God, HOV<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now I'm knee-deep in the concrete<br/>
Like the streets made of quicksand beyond deep<br/>
I got a chemical romance, two left feet<br/>
So now I dance with the devil, please GOD<br/>
Save me from the black parade, release me<br/>
My life like Grand Theft Auto PSP<br/>
I'm in the Volvo puffing on the la la<br/>
Ducking from the po-po<br/>
Every time I drive by<br/>
Say hi to the bad guy<br/>
All my momma friends is like hmm hmm hmm<br/>
Would you just look at him<br/>
So sorry dear momma for your embarrassment<br/>
Give me a couple years I pray I never sin again<br/>
Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in<br/>
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am. I am.<br/>
I'm feeling like the world's against me Lord<br/>
Call me crazy but strangely I love the odds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now these baby ballers toy rappers<br/>
Calling out my name to bring the boy backwards<br/>
Shooting air balls at the basket<br/>
What you call money I paid more in taxes<br/>
I got crowned King down in Africa<br/>
Down in Nigeria do you have any idea<br/>
Sold out shows in Seoul Korea<br/>
Jo-berg, Dublin, Tanzania<br/>
Lunch with Mandela, dinner with Cavalli<br/>
Still got time to give water out to everybody<br/>
Everybody fall back<br/>
Y'all rapping I'm reenacting<br/>
CNN you see it's accurate<br/>
ESPN see me in action<br/>
Monday nights when the half ends<br/>
When you ten years in holla back then
