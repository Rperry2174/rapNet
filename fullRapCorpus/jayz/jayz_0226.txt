(Good morn' or evening, friends<br/>
Smile, you recordin')<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors<br/>
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures<br/>
We drinkin' Cristal in, yeah<br/>
Kept the trey on me like Chris Paulin'<br/>
Drinkin' Ace of Spade like it's codeine now<br/>
Tryna put a million on the whole team now<br/>
Push through the pain so we can see new life<br/>
So all the ladies havin' babies, see a sacrifice<br/>
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian<br/>
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian<br/>
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate<br/>
Society shame and the pain was too much to take<br/>
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love<br/>
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her<br/>
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate<br/>
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake<br/>
<br/>
Bad times turn to good memories, smile<br/>
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile<br/>
Good times never fade away, smile<br/>
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile<br/>
Good morn' or evening, friends<br/>
Smile<br/>
Here's your friendly announcer<br/>
Smile<br/>
<br/>
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called<br/>
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board<br/>
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen<br/>
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?<br/>
Flyin' paper planes through the projects<br/>
Now the whole projects on my jet<br/>
Now you see the real in the front row<br/>
In every one of y'all televised shows<br/>
Super facts<br/>
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that<br/>
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson<br/>
Appreciate the pain, it's a blessin'<br/>
<br/>
Bad times turn to good memories, smile<br/>
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile<br/>
Good times never fade away, smile<br/>
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile<br/>
Good morn' or evening, friends<br/>
<br/>
I mastered my aesthetics<br/>
I know you often heard me wax poetic<br/>
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus<br/>
But trust me, that was nothin'<br/>
A nigga up in the hundreds of millions<br/>
I have no ceilings, ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy<br/>
Anita Baker's "You Bring Me Joy"<br/>
Slappin' out of the toy, the separation is clear<br/>
In my rear-view mirror, objects is further than they appear<br/>
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair<br/>
Playin' for high stakes<br/>
Norman Cake, he looked up and out of the Lear<br/>
How niggas can't relate?<br/>
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake<br/>
Chargin' my own fate<br/>
Respect Jimmy Iovine<br/>
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime<br/>
And niggas playin' for power, huh<br/>
So our music is ours<br/>
Niggas only own houses<br/>
Ours was, "Fuck you, pay me"<br/>
Now it's, "Fuck payin' me, I pay you<br/>
Put the rest away for Blue"<br/>
That blood money, I giggle at it<br/>
Can't even support my Mrs. habit<br/>
Jewelry shoppin' in Paris<br/>
All y'all jewelers should be embarrassed, huh<br/>
Blood diamonds drippin', we cute<br/>
I still ain't trippin', that's life, winners and losers<br/>
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless<br/>
My therapist said I relapsed<br/>
I said, "Prehaps I Freudian slipped in European whips"<br/>
God sent me to break the chain<br/>
I'm the true and livin'<br/>
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain<br/>
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ<br/>
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you<br/>
Ahhhh, what did I do?<br/>
'Cept try to free you<br/>
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you<br/>
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh<br/>
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to<br/>
This was meant to be a haiku, huh<br/>
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line<br/>
And too old, these that drugs<br/>
Heroin flow, I spaz on the stove<br/>
This is Hov, no Flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?<br/>
Look, you a pedestrian<br/>
Don't ever question the security I provided you<br/>
Oh y'all thought I was washed?<br/>
I'm at the cleaners<br/>
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh<br/>
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church<br/>
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt<br/>
Feared for you, bro, we know the system don't work<br/>
Take a young niggas freedom over some dirt<br/>
Yet it's legal in Colorado<br/>
Yeah, we deny<br/>
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise<br/>
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called "the trap"<br/>
That's why it's called "the projects" 'cause it's exactly that!<br/>
All these people was gon' kill me, heh<br/>
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me<br/>
Welcome back Carter, smile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gloria Carter:]</i><br/>
Living in the shadow<br/>
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?<br/>
In the shadows people see you as happy and free<br/>
Because that's what you want them to see<br/>
Living two lives, happy, but not free<br/>
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love<br/>
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free<br/>
But you live with the fear of just being me<br/>
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be<br/>
No harm for them, no harm for me<br/>
But life is short, and it's time to be free<br/>
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed<br/>
Smile
