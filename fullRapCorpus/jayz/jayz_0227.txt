<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Ready for it<br/>
I'm ready for it<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
Ah...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
East Side nigga<br/>
With that feets high<br/>
Nigga with that Li-sa<br/>
Talkin' about that Li-sa, nigga<br/>
With that we-sa, nigga<br/>
With that East Side<br/>
That dance, uh<br/>
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies<br/>
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly<br/>
<br/>
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you<br/>
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths<br/>
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot<br/>
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your Roots<br/>
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap<br/>
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh<br/>
Y'all body language is all remedial<br/>
How could you see the difference between you and I?<br/>
My crash course was much tougher<br/>
'Round friends who kill they friends<br/>
Then hug their friends' mothers<br/>
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares<br/>
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there<br/>
Memories may sneak down my cheek<br/>
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void<br/>
Eyes open them up, check off the coins<br/>
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you<br/>
I'm ready for earth, ready for real<br/>
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there<br/>
So it seems, so you seem<br/>
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare<br/>
In my dreams, in my dreams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I sat down with Prince, eye to eye<br/>
He told me his wishes before he died<br/>
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind<br/>
They only see green from them purple eyes<br/>
They eyes hide, they eyes high<br/>
My eyes wide shut to all the lies<br/>
These industry niggas, they always been fishy<br/>
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh<br/>
This guy had 'Slave' on his face<br/>
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?<br/>
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house<br/>
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket<br/>
Don't big bro me, don't "Big Homie"<br/>
I've seen pure admiration become rivals<br/>
I've been to Paris at least two times<br/>
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void<br/>
Eyes open them up, check off the coins<br/>
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you<br/>
I'm ready for earth, ready for real<br/>
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there<br/>
So it seems, so you seem<br/>
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare<br/>
In my dreams, in my dreams<br/>
<br/>
I've been out of touch for a couple years<br/>
I've been ready for this for real<br/>
Hopin' I can touch what I see<br/>
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real<br/>
<br/>
"Look you've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
East Side nigga<br/>
With that feets high<br/>
Nigga with that Li-sa<br/>
Talkin' about that Li-sa, nigga<br/>
With that we-sa, nigga<br/>
With that East Side<br/>
That dance, uh<br/>
Your eyes speak the truth with everything else, stars<br/>
They pretend we can but the vibes don't fly
