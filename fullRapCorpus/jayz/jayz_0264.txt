Jigga<br/>
Biatch<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Fuck Judge Wapner<br/>
It's Jigga<br/>
Ya heard?<br/>
Y'all niggas in violation of Playa-Hatin Code<br/>
Section 1001<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
Yo, I gives a fuck if you traumed up<br/>
Dom Perrignon'ed up<br/>
Niggas from where want what?<br/>
One slip'll get your cherry bombed up<br/>
I got heavy arm<br/>
And my niggas Homicide and Deadly Calm in the cut<br/>
B, test your dumb blonde luck<br/>
Fuck with the wrong one<br/>
Shawn Gun, harm one, two<br/>
Fuck y'all wan' do?<br/>
Bastards, niggas know I blast quick<br/>
As if y'all had to ask - shit<br/>
Get your ass twist<br/>
It's the rap's El Ni?o, get your brain splitted<br/>
And I don't like pussy well enough to hang with it<br/>
You ain't with it, same shit, they<br/>
Can't fuck with the languaddage<br/>
Soon as the slang's spitted<br/>
If you came you get it<br/>
Plain as a game with them thangs with it<br/>
On co-sign and the whole nine<br/>
Leave you where I find yo ass - lost with no signs<br/>
You're so wrong<br/>
I'm the last nigga to roll on<br/>
Got a vest on, went to Folsom<br/>
When you guess wrong I'ma press one<br/>
Muthafucka<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Fuck the judge, fuck the jury<br/>
When you're warin with me<br/>
It's People's Court, we hold court in the street<br/>
I gives a fuck about the D.A.<br/>
When you see Jay<br/>
Better crawl for your heat<br/>
It's People's Court, we hold court in the street<br/>
Ya heard me?<br/>
<br/>
Fuck the judge, fuck the jury<br/>
When you're warin with me<br/>
It's People's Court, we hold court in the street<br/>
I gives a shit about the plaintiff<br/>
Nigga, dangerous, watch your langauge with me<br/>
It's People's Court, we hold court in the street<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
I give a shit if it's small claims like stealin your bitch<br/>
Or if it's Supreme Court like stealin your bricks<br/>
Look, my guns is all-range, more pain<br/>
Indifferential, whether you're big money or small change<br/>
When I cock it - ball game<br/>
My pistals never miss-trial, here's the determent<br/>
With no chance of parole bullets comin concurrent<br/>
I'm like "Why, nigga, try Jigga?" You must remember<br/>
It's like bein on trial for your life with a public defender<br/>
Let the jury fill the seats up and start the court calendar off<br/>
With docu number 9mm<br/>
All rise...<br/>
The Honourable Jay-Z presides<br/>
Instead of a mallet I hold a tool<br/>
All objections over-ruled<br/>
Say your opening arguments, hope you understand it<br/>
Two guns, right over left, that's how I cross-examine<br/>
Like Tom Cruise, popppin with the _Top Gun_ you lose<br/>
Jigga's no lie, and y'all can't handle the truth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3]</i><br/>
No flow's sicker, no cell can hold Jigga<br/>
Since I dropped 'Reasonable Doubt' no cocaine convictors<br/>
No contest in a rhyme fest, I'm best<br/>
Under oath raise my hand, and I spit it - honest<br/>
Know our facts for real 'fore y'all decide to act ill<br/>
When you blow trial ain't no comin back on the pill<br/>
It's Murder One, bail set at a half a mill<br/>
It's Murder One, for you backwards muthafuckas: red-rum<br/>
Committ hate crimes, fake crimes, I hold in contempt<br/>
You get state time for fakin like you greater than Him<br/>
So cop a plea to lessen charges, pay your fine at the Desk Sergeant<br/>
Say you're sorry, then - take your property<br/>
I be sho' defended, flow splendid, no co-defendant<br/>
While you niggas hold trial with no motions in it<br/>
Three time felon, third album, lockin it down for the term<br/>
Of 'Lifetime', Vol. 2, nigga, court is adjourned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i>
