<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk<br/>
Kidnap and robberies like (c'mon nigga) "You're going with us"<br/>
I held roundtable meetings so we could go on and discuss<br/>
not only money but all the emotions going through us<br/>
Why we don't cry when niggas die, that's how the street raised him<br/>
Look in the air, say a prayer (hail Mary) hoping God forgave him<br/>
Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement<br/>
We live dangerous, often finding ourself in the eyes of strangers<br/>
(Who the fuck is you?) My dream is big and in it my team is rich<br/>
as seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit<br/>
Back to live action, I'm packing, I'm still in the mix<br/>
like new hits, I think I'm going over your head a little bit<br/>
But I let you know I changed names when I roam through town<br/>
Stay free and be who I'm professional known as now<br/>
Jay-motherfucking-Z; and with that said<br/>
back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
My infatuation with autos led to autos getting sprayed<br/>
Houses getting broken in, quarters getting tried<br/>
Bricks getting chopped, mom's pots getting used<br/>
One thrown in that water, try the soda in there too<br/>
Expensive shoes worn, Louis Vuitton seat, roof gone<br/>
Coke cheap, my face is like a coupon<br/>
I gotta do Shawn, 'cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm<br/>
I was getting my loot on, nigga I'm too strong<br/>
Eat till the food's gone, they placed me on this earth<br/>
The twin brother of Rick Porter, separated at birth<br/>
I got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler<br/>
Fuck with us, walk through the ghetto, see the place that corrupted us<br/>
Learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us<br/>
Ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit<br/>
Plus ain't nobody loving us; and with that said<br/>
back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
See my life is like a see-saw<br/>
And until I move this weight it's gonna keep me to the floor<br/>
Travel with me through my deep thoughts<br/>
You all can't learn Jigga by the shit you all be reading in The Source;<br/>
It's deeper of course<br/>
Follow the life of this reckless minor<br/>
At sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver<br/>
Playing, cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us<br/>
Flipping a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers)<br/>
Buck-thirty on the turns<br/>
Reckless abandon, when I'm standing on this pedal<br/>
Hand on my metal, minus all this time they trying to give me<br/>
Lord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or<br/>
somebody to tell me that they felt me<br/>
I tried to play the hand you dealt me<br/>
but you gave me five funnies and shit<br/>
I was hungry I need menage money<br/>
Nothing less than a 520; and with that said<br/>
back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is *BLAM*<br/>
<br/>
(Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh)
