(Skin is, skin, is<br/>
Skin black, my skin is black<br/>
My, black, my skin is yellow)<br/>
<br/>
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga<br/>
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga<br/>
Still nigga, still nigga<br/>
I like that second one<br/>
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga<br/>
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga<br/>
Still nigga, still nigga<br/>
<br/>
O.J. like, "I'm not black, I'm O.J." ...okay<br/>
House nigga, don't fuck with me<br/>
I'm a field nigga with shined cutlery<br/>
Gold-plated quarters where the butlers be<br/>
I'mma play the corners where the hustlers be<br/>
I told him, "Please don't die over the neighborhood<br/>
That your mama rentin'<br/>
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood<br/>
That's how you rinse it"<br/>
I bought every V12 engine<br/>
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'<br/>
I coulda bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo<br/>
For like 2 million<br/>
That same building today is worth 25 million<br/>
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo<br/>
<br/>
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga<br/>
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga<br/>
Still nigga, still nigga<br/>
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga<br/>
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga<br/>
Still nigga, still nigga<br/>
<br/>
You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit<br/>
You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it<br/>
Financial freedom my only hope<br/>
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke<br/>
I bought some artwork for 1 million<br/>
2 years later, that shit worth 2 million<br/>
Few years later, that shit worth 8 million<br/>
I can't wait to give this shit to my children<br/>
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine<br/>
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99<br/>
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8<br/>
I turned my life into a nice first week release date<br/>
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh?<br/>
Me and my niggas takin' real Chances, uh<br/>
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear<br/>
There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga<br/>
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga<br/>
Still nigga, still nigga<br/>
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga<br/>
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga<br/>
Still nigga, still nigga
