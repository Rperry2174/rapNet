Hov’s a Blackberry Bold,<br/>
Shawty is a Sidekick,<br/>
She used to have a man,<br/>
I used to have a side chick,<br/>
Shawty got wind I had to blow the chick off,<br/>
got rid of him they both took the sh-t hard,<br/>
shawty play the piano me I play the white keys,<br/>
shawty from the south, oh, i think she like me,<br/>
Shawty like Pac, me Big Poppa,<br/>
screaming hit em up, I’m screaming who shot ya,<br/>
I’m on that red wine, shawty like white,<br/>
same sh-t different toilet,<br/>
we both getting nice,<br/>
me I’m from the apple which means I’m the Mac,<br/>
She’s a PC, she lives in my lap.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shawty get it in,<br/>
Daddy go hard<br/>
Shawty get it in,<br/>
Daddy go hard<br/>
Shawty get it in,<br/>
Daddy go hard<br/>
Shawty get it in,<br/>
Daddy go hard<br/>
Shawty get it in,<br/>
Daddy go hard<br/>
Shawty get it in,<br/>
Venus Versus Mars,<br/>
<br/>
Whether Black or white we both like Mike,<br/>
We both like Jordans, We both Phil’s Knight’s,<br/>
When I finish breakfast, shawty’s out for lunch,<br/>
yeah we both eating its better than brunch,<br/>
shawty like Pepsi, me I’m da Coke Man,<br/>
Body like a coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can,<br/>
Started at the window, then the bedroom wall,<br/>
the Ying to my Yang, I skeet skeet off,<br/>
I hits it from the back, Shawty like the front,<br/>
the Bonnie to my Clyde,<br/>
both riding shotgun,<br/>
both covered in gold like C3PO,<br/>
James and Florida Evans let the good times roll,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Thought Shawty was the truth, found out she was a cheater,<br/>
we were supposed to takeover, I caught her bumping Ether!<br/>
I thought shawty like Mike, found out she like Prince,<br/>
thought she was Adrian, it’s been Rocky ever since,<br/>
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euro’s,<br/>
Took my whole flavour, I call her coke zero,<br/>
Co-MVP like Kobe and Shaq,<br/>
left me for the Heat,<br/>
we were winning back to back,<br/>
said I partied too much, shawty got fed up,<br/>
shawty got Britney shaved her whole head up,<br/>
we used to make out, kissing each others face off,<br/>
Fell for the ponzi scheme, damn shawty just Made-off.
