Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 — Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yeah I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca<br/>
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever<br/>
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here<br/>
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere<br/>
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos<br/>
Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's<br/>
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State St.<br/>
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons' whipping Pastry<br/>
Cruisin' down 8th St., off-white Lexus<br/>
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas<br/>
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie<br/>
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me<br/>
Say what up to TyTy, still sippin' Mai Tai's<br/>
Sittin' courtside, Knicks &amp; Nets give me high five<br/>
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee<br/>
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus — Alicia Keys:]</i><br/>
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of<br/>
There's nothin' you can't do<br/>
Now you're in New York<br/>
These streets will make you feel brand new<br/>
The lights will inspire you<br/>
Let's hear it for New York, New York,<br/>
New York<br/>
<br/>
(You welcome OG—I made you hot, nigga!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 — Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game<br/>
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can<br/>
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though<br/>
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though<br/>
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock<br/>
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop<br/>
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back<br/>
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add<br/>
8 million stories, out there in the naked<br/>
City it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it<br/>
Me, I got a plug Special Ed "I Got It Made"<br/>
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade<br/>
Three dice Cee-lo, three Card Molly<br/>
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley<br/>
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade<br/>
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(That boy good... welcome to the bright light, baby.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 — Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders<br/>
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is<br/>
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually<br/>
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve<br/>
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style<br/>
Anna Wintour gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out<br/>
City of sin, it's a pity on a whim<br/>
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them<br/>
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out<br/>
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route<br/>
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin<br/>
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end<br/>
Came here for school, graduated to the high life<br/>
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight<br/>
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion<br/>
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge — Alicia Keys:]</i><br/>
One hand in the air for the big city<br/>
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty<br/>
No place in the world that could compare<br/>
Put your lighters in the air<br/>
Everybody say "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (c'mon, c'mon)<br/>
I'm from...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
