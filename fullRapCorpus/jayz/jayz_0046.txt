<i>[sound of a camera taking a picture]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i><br/>
Millenium flow<br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i><br/>
This is {bullshit} y'all<br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
in New York City for the first day in the trial of <br/>
<i>[Jay]</i><br/>
I'm gone <i>[car speeds off]</i><br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
the State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i><br/>
Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh<br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be<br/>
the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Aiyyo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice<br/>
or witness to me killin the track<br/>
Testify 'til me spillin the smack<br/>
Now they got me for traffickin, racketeerin, audio crack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
They call me Dope Man, Dope Man<br/>
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man<br/>
Ghetto spokes-man<br/>
<br/>
A broke man, approachin the bench with intent<br/>
to bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man<br/>
Evidence stemmin from ninety-six<br/>
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix<br/>
While they was usin cut I was on some other shit<br/>
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it<br/>
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised<br/>
Listenin to testimony about my foul ways<br/>
Exhibit A: "Reasonable Doubt"<br/>
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
You can feel the tension building here<br/>
as an unprecedented number of people have turned out<br/>
for what may be the "Trial of the Century"<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
How come, you label your brand of dope<br/>
"Volume 1" and spread it through the slums?<br/>
Fed it to the young with total disregard<br/>
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge<br/>
And how could you, turn right around<br/>
and release a lethal dosage called "Volume 2"<br/>
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise<br/>
known as Roc-a-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?<br/>
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise<br/>
of record execs, and do you object?<br/>
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects<br/>
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan<br/>
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen<br/>
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons<br/>
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder, Inc.<br/>
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
The State is seeking the maximum penalty<br/>
and with the overwhelming amount of evidence<br/>
the D.A.'s presented, things aren't looking good<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
Despite the grim outlook at this point<br/>
the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant<br/>
in the face of adversity<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
Jay-Z is taking the stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air<br/>
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear<br/>
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance<br/>
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands<br/>
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up<br/>
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up<br/>
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks<br/>
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors<br/>
Keep us spiralin, goin backwards<br/>
At age nine, saw my first hate crime<br/>
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line<br/>
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine<br/>
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined<br/>
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine<br/>
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine<br/>
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
While the jury is inside deliberating<br/>
outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[MTV]</i><br/>
Well the verdict has just been announced: NOT GUILTY!<br/>
It is complete pandemonium out here! <i>[Hook; Serena keeps speaking]</i><br/>
People are cheering and hugging - there he is<br/>
Jay-Z is exiting the courtroom right now<br/>
There is a swarm of cameras surrounding him <i>[pop bulbs flashing]</i><br/>
and people are just rushing up to him<br/>
Let's try and make our way over there, Jay-Z! Jay-Z!<br/>
<i>[sounds of cameras keep flashing, music fades]</i>
