<i>[Jay-Z talking:]</i><br/>
Turn the lights even lower! <br/>
Hovah <br/>
Memphis Bleek <br/>
Beanie Seigels (uh huh) <br/>
Roc-a-fella y'all (yeah yeah) <br/>
DMX: Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
To the top wit my niggas <br/>
Pop wit my niggas <br/>
Drive by in whips, rock rocks wit my niggas <br/>
Break day on the hottest block wit my niggas <br/>
Just cause I (DMX)love my niggas (uh huh) <br/>
Chill wit the crew (uh huh) <br/>
Real wit the crew <br/>
4 million sold, look- still wit the crew <br/>
Break bread wit the fam <br/>
Till I'm dead wit the fam <br/>
Duck cops. Shake feds wit the fam <br/>
Flip them pies wit my hustlas (uh huh) <br/>
Ride for my hustlas <br/>
Die for my, lie for my, cry for my hustlas <br/>
Roll wit my duns (uh huh) <br/>
Cold wit the guns (uh huh) <br/>
If he slow wit my ones hit the floor when I come <br/>
I fuck wit them hoes that fuck wit them clothes <br/>
That's real wit them shoes, keep it real wit they dudes <br/>
I'm sick wit the flow and this is all I know<br/>
More money, more cash, more hoes BEYACHHHH!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Jay-Z (DMX) 2x:]</i><br/>
More money, more cash, more hoes (what) <br/>
More money, more cash, more hoes (uh) <br/>
More money, more cash, more hoes (come on) <br/>
More money, more cash, more hoes (what, what, what) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Memphis Bleek:]</i><br/>
Ay yo, M-E-M-P-H-I-S Bleek <br/>
No need to dress warm, I brought plenty of heat <br/>
Y'all can't do nothing with this here <br/>
For one, I pack three 9s like the year <br/>
Y'all funny money hustlas <br/>
7 gram hustlas <br/>
Type to bust a O down wit ya man hustlas <br/>
I hold bank dough, dough 6-5-4 <br/>
While you ho talk that, look for a walk dough <br/>
Petty crime niggas <br/>
Petty time niggas <br/>
Sold petty drugs came up wit petty thugs <br/>
Now you got game in you <br/>
Wanna be a menace and you got Kane in you <br/>
I'll put them thangs in you <br/>
I'm a hot lil' nigga <br/>
I ain't gotta tell niggas <br/>
You came too deep, one fell niggas <br/>
I'm layin in the cut but still don't give a fuck <br/>
Roc-a-fella forever, Memph man, what what <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Beanie Sigel:]</i><br/>
Peep the kid from P-H-I-L-L-Y <br/>
North west south west south side <br/>
Spit it for them bitches and niggas who stay fly <br/>
B-Mack, Roc-a-fella till I die <br/>
Met Jay, dropped on a album in a week <br/>
Without unsigned hype or battle of the beats <br/>
The first time niggas heard me spit it in the streets <br/>
I gave y'all a thousand bars wit Memphis Bleek <br/>
Stay strapped, heat in the car under the seat <br/>
6 hammers even though we only 3 deep <br/>
We clap up niggas <br/>
Smack up niggas <br/>
Duck tape, rope, and wrap up niggas <br/>
Think shit a joke, go head crack up niggas <br/>
Get treated like Coke and get capped up niggas <br/>
The only thing funny <br/>
Is y'all never seen big face money <br/>
Till them big face 20s <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z talking:]</i><br/>
Roc-a-fella shit <br/>
1999 (uh huh) <br/>
You about to witness a dynasty (you are not ready) unlike no other <br/>
Get down or lay down Ya heard! <br/>
No publishin' for niggas <br/>
I know y'all niggas wonderin, like: <br/>
When them niggas gone stop? (come on) <br/>
We got a date for you- <br/>
February 31st, 19-neva hate (haha) <br/>
I know y'all niggas ready to kill yaself, too <br/>
Just go head and do it! <br/>
Jump off a buildin, slit ya wrists! <br/>
Just do it! <br/>
The world'll be a better place (haha) <br/>
Roc-a-fella <br/>
Beanie Seigel<br/>
Memphis Bleek <br/>
Hovah Hovah <br/>
