It's the Roc!  Wooo!<br/>
My gear is right... (check)<br/>
My bucket is low... (check)<br/>
My Rocawear is fittin' incredible...<br/>
<br/>
Fuck it...<br/>
I guess I got my swagger back<br/>
Mama that said I killed her man<br/>
Well I guess I got the dagger back<br/>
It's the Roc bastards we are BACK!<br/>
In the heezy<br/>
Jiggaman, B. Sieg to M-Easy (what up fam?)<br/>
Oskino and Sparks and Freeweezy (holla!)<br/>
Mickey, Mallory, Chris and Neef, hey!<br/>
All I need is the love of my crew<br/>
The whole industry can hate me I thugged my way through<br/>
And all...I...need is a chick to hold a jimmy like<br/>
Meth and Mary, like, Marvin and Tammi, unnnh...<br/>
Now understands we can't be stopped<br/>
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops<br/>
Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty<br/>
A nigga been focused since I said hi to 30 (what up?)<br/>
Young niggas ya'll can't hurt me<br/>
Better watch and observe me<br/>
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar<br/>
I set fire to your empire<br/>
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off the rim tires<br/>
Yes I-ah...Jay I-ah...<br/>
Double G-A livewire nigga holla back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
All I need...<br/>
Rocawear... (check)<br/>
Nike Airs... (check)<br/>
Mean bucket... (uh huh)<br/>
Armadale in the club couple o' duckets (yeah)<br/>
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride<br/>
All I need...<br/>
That new coupe (got that)<br/>
A doo-rag and a pocket full o' loot (got those)<br/>
A sunny day some chicks that wanna play<br/>
And I'll be on my way<br/>
<br/>
C'mon...now...<br/>
All I need in this world o' sin<br/>
Is me and my girlfriend! (ha ha)<br/>
I got a little two-two I call 'er Peggy Sue<br/>
When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (wooo!)<br/>
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh)<br/>
A clown wan' flip gotta reach for my bitch<br/>
Wanna act out a movie I could give you a clip (buk!)<br/>
But no adlibbin' nigga stick to the script<br/>
Now all...I...need is a high-priced lawyer<br/>
Cuz it's foul ways nowadays everybody saw you<br/>
And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew<br/>
Can't even steal on a nigga muhfuckas'll sue<br/>
In this time and age, cuz real muhfuckas'll do<br/>
When I'm surrounded by squeal muhfuckas like you<br/>
But real niggas don't fret cuz the number one crew?<br/>
R to the O to the C comin' true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Listen...<br/>
The cream too long, my team too strong<br/>
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone<br/>
Ya'll niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see ya'll)<br/>
Ya'll whole block deserted, ya'll fiends are gone (bye bye!)<br/>
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith<br/>
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willy Beaman <i>[giggle]</i><br/>
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional<br/>
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you waaaaant it)<br/>
Whoever got hops get blocked go to the hole<br/>
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit<br/>
Plus the jab is sick, and it's that quick<br/>
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six<br/>
Now run along wit'cha little ass hits<br/>
Read my rap sheet nigga, THREE CLASSICS<br/>
Shut ya bumba' got A-Rod numbers<br/>
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk<br/>
When I blast the pump, I leave you relaxed<br/>
In the hospital lookin' at M*A*S*H for months<br/>
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk<br/>
And the fleece got free and pee-pee on the steps...<br/>
We've got no respect<br/>
No law or governin' why you fuckin' wit' him?<br/>
Matta'fact, why you fuckin' wit' them?<br/>
All ya'll need is the R-O-C baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Listen...<br/>
(All I need)<br/>
Rocafella Records...<br/>
Freeway...<br/>
Oskino and Sparks...<br/>
Chris &amp; Neef<br/>
(All I need)<br/>
Mickey and Mallory...<br/>
Broad Street Bully...<br/>
M-Extra Money, ha...<br/>
YOUNG!<br/>
