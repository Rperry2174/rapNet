<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam<br/>
So she call me cabron plus marricon<br/>
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home<br/>
I'm like, "Un momento" - mami, slow up your tempo<br/>
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act<br/>
Always talkin out her neck, makin her fingers snap<br/>
She like, "Listen Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap<br/>
You better - R-E-S-P-E-C-T me"<br/>
I got this French chick that love to french kiss<br/>
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist<br/>
My, cherie amor, tÂ£ est belle<br/>
Merci, you fine as fuck but you givin me hell<br/>
I got this indian squaw the day that I met her<br/>
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather<br/>
She said all you need to know is I'm not a ho<br/>
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough<br/>
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, indian and black<br/>
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn I'm gettin fat<br/>
Arroz con pollo, french fries and crepe<br/>
An appetitite for destruction but I scrape the plate<br/>
I love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tip]</i> Girls, girls, girls, girls (uh-huh)<br/>
Girls, I do adore<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya<br/>
Holla at ya when I come off tour<br/>
<i>[Tip]</i> I love girls, girls, girls, girls<br/>
Girls all over the globe<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> I come scoop you in that Coupe, sittin on deuce-zeroes<br/>
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll - c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got this young chick, she so immature<br/>
She like, "Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?"<br/>
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor<br/>
Gotta toss a couple dollars, just to shut up her holla<br/>
Got a project chick, that plays her part<br/>
And if it goes down y'all that's my heart<br/>
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start<br/>
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts<br/>
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean<br/>
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean<br/>
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene<br/>
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time<br/>
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick<br/>
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick<br/>
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love<br/>
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club<br/>
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model<br/>
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tahoe<br/>
That means I'm new school, pop pills and stay in beef<br/>
But I never have a problem with my first class seat<br/>
I love<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house<br/>
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out<br/>
Got a chick from Peru, that sniff Peru<br/>
She got a cousin at customs that get shit through<br/>
Got this weedhead chick, she always catch me doin shit<br/>
Crazy girl wanna leave me but she always forgets<br/>
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick'<br/>
Cause she kept bootleggin my shit - man<br/>
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull<br/>
She like, "Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?"<br/>
I'm like excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass<br/>
you was dead broke and naked, and now you want half<br/>
I got this ho that after twelve million sold<br/>
Mami's a narcolyptic, always sleepin on Hov'<br/>
Gotta tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow<br/>
I got so many girls across the globe..<br/>
