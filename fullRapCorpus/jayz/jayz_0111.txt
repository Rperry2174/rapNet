<i>[Intro: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You can't roll a blunt to this one<br/>
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J<br/>
You gotta puff a J on this one {*inhales*}<br/>
You can't even drink Crist-ALL on this one<br/>
You gotta drink Crist-ALL<br/>
Buy some red wine, a little Gocha 9-7<br/>
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell - over the end of Jay-Z's intro]</i><br/>
You're so contagious, I can't take it<br/>
Have my baby, let's just make it<br/>
Ex-cuse me; what's your name?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?<br/>
Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be hangin wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z<br/>
(Pharrell: So hot to trot.. la-dy!)<br/>
Excuse me miss, what's your name?<br/>
Can you come, hang with me?<br/>
Possibly, can I take you out, to-night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
You already know what it's hittin for<br/>
Ma I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin on<br/>
50/50 venture with them S dots kickin off<br/>
Armadale poppin now, only bring a nigga more<br/>
Only thing missin is a Missus<br/>
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers<br/>
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner<br/>
to play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST<br/>
Who else you gon' run with, the truth is us<br/>
Only dudes movin units - Em, Pimp Juice and us<br/>
.. it's the Roc in here!<br/>
Maebach outside got rocks of air<br/>
PJ's on the runway, Young got air<br/>
I don't land at a airport, I call it the clearport<br/>
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more<br/>
back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Sex-cuse me... damn!<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i> I got my Gocha 9-7 on right now<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> La-dy..<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> You gotta puff a J to this one<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Can't roll a blunt up to this one boy<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> You're so contagious, I can't take it<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Have my baby, let's just make it<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Ex-cuse me; what's your name? (AOWW!)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Everybody's like, "He's no item! Please don't like him.<br/>
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!"<br/>
Now she don't like him, she never met him<br/>
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em<br/>
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em<br/>
Better them than me, she don't agree with him<br/>
She's mad at that, he's not havin that<br/>
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets<br/>
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along<br/>
with a flashy nigga braggin on the song<br/>
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that<br/>
He 2-ways her, so she writes back<br/>
Smiley faces after all of her phrases<br/>
Either she the one or I'm caught in "The Matrix"<br/>
But fukkit, let the +Fish-burne+<br/>
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Sex-cuse me... damn!<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> You're so contagious, I can't take it<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Have my baby, let's just make it<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> La-dy..<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> You're so contagious, I can't take it<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Have my baby, let's just make it<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Ex-cuse me; what's your name?<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> So hot to trot.. la-dy! What's your name?<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Woo!<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one<br/>
you can easily get past, but that chapter is done<br/>
... but I'm done readin for now<br/>
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now<br/>
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role<br/>
I'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes<br/>
Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin<br/>
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Sex-cuse me... damn!<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> You're so contagious, I can't take it<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Have my baby, let's just make it<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> La-dy..<br/>
<i>[Ph.W.]</i> You're so contagious, I can't take it<br/>
