<i>[Intro: Tone (Doug E. Fresh)]</i><br/>
Yo, this Tone the referee, knawhatimean?<br/>
And I'm about to bring y'all some history<br/>
We got the best of both worlds<br/>
And I got the Get Fresh Crew<br/>
Doug Fresh! (one, two, three, come on!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Mirror mirror on the wall<br/>
Whose is the freshest of them all?<br/>
I love 'em all, but none of y'all<br/>
Is Doug E., as me and the boy Kelly<br/>
With the suicide doors, fuck 'em all<br/>
We got hits like a thirty shot clip<br/>
When we throw it in the air, everybody hit the floor<br/>
Holla at your boy, boys<br/>
When we boys, so we bringin' out them toys<br/>
I ain't a lame, on them Dana Dane's<br/>
Wiggie, you annoyed man, when the year change, we change<br/>
Nigga, we right here, we can go bank for bank<br/>
We can go clip for clip, nigga, chain for chain<br/>
We can go bitch for bitch, got a pretty young thing<br/>
That I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Meeting Michelle at the hotel<br/>
While Jay and Tone on the way to the afterparty<br/>
Got the ladies sayin', oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Best of both worlds, and we rock the club<br/>
youknowhatimsayin<br/>
Boy H-O, Kells, we not playing<br/>
Losers lose, so when we does what we do, we win<br/>
And win again, like deja vu<br/>
Then we win again, like M.J. do<br/>
Three-peat, then we retreat to waters that's blue<br/>
Young Scrappy, that's what grown man do, let's move<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
In this arena, arena<br/>
All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up<br/>
This is for them hustlin' boys and girls<br/>
It's the return of best of both worlds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slick Rick]</i><br/>
Well once upon a time, they left the glove and the star, kid<br/>
He swore he was the man, but he was nothing but garbage<br/>
Let me rephrase that, bubblin' with pride<br/>
Did have skills, but he was ugly inside<br/>
Instead of uplift folks, sittin' on the non sense<br/>
Hurtin' people feelings like he didn't have a conscience<br/>
Like 'I love you', when he's hittin' that stash<br/>
Then degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class<br/>
Even let a gay jew man tack his jheri<br/>
Then, got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy<br/>
Swindlin', forgot the god above him<br/>
Finally, fan base trinklin' down to nothing<br/>
No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break<br/>
Bitter and evil, didn't learn from his mistake<br/>
The moral of the story is, don't be a pair of knickers<br/>
Be good, boys and girls, and you can be as great as<br/>
Rick is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly w/ Doug E. Fresh beatboxing]</i><br/>
My baby momma's robe, my rent is overdue<br/>
It took half the pay, and now my life is filled with rainy days<br/>
But I stashed some dough, how much, you'll ever know<br/>
It's Doug Fresh, Slick Rick, Kells and Jay-Z
