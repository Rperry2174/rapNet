<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
That nigga let his fuckin flow go<br/>
Niggaz tryin to switch up the flows on niggaz<br/>
Hit niggaz, slip niggaz with a micky<br/>
Drop that joint<br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah (it's the remix y'all)<br/>
Like a muh'fucker (oh yeah)<br/>
Whassup my nigga (and still hot up in that boy, ain't it man)<br/>
(Yo Jay, Kel, fin' ta set it off for y'all)<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
It's, the, remix<br/>
TrackMaster remix y'all, Kels and Jigga<br/>
Big chips with Twista y'all, get this money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
I, heard the ballers when I pulled up to the club<br/>
Cause I'm rollin up on fo' flickers<br/>
Peanut-butter interior, black body<br/>
And in case you didn't know, I be the Twista<br/>
Hundred bombs in my pockets, put your ones up<br/>
I hear some niggaz lookin at me for the come up<br/>
Try to creep creep, I pull a gun up<br/>
I put a hole in the first nigga that run up<br/>
The ballers be Jay, R, and T<br/>
Spit it cold cause the music is a part of me<br/>
Can't nobody spit it fast as me<br/>
Got an academy of haters comin after me<br/>
I know I got what you want, I know I got what you need<br/>
Come and mob to the top before you get, this, money<br/>
<br/>
Pull up on the block in the alien gray Bentley<br/>
Full of sport modes, you never could hang with me<br/>
Just to get in early, I paid a extra 50<br/>
Gettin that money my nigga<br/>
Oh-five Chrysler, trees for the blunts<br/>
Three hoes in the back, two fiends in the front<br/>
Twenty-two inch shoes, CV's in the trunk<br/>
Gettin that money my nigga<br/>
Makin dough off a style I be the best in<br/>
Glad to be down with these two livin legends<br/>
Now let me see which league I'ma invest in<br/>
Gettin that money my nigga<br/>
Rollin this cheer, put the niggaz in fear<br/>
Makin bitches shed tears, take a look at my career<br/>
Now the shit's swell; when I get up to 70 in the Coupe<br/>
Peep the wing when I hope out the tail - tell 'em Kel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
We off up in the club, we got our hands up<br/>
Drinks in the club because we gettin that money my nigga<br/>
We rollin 24's, open them Bentley do's<br/>
Got plenty hoes because we gettin that money my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Pull up to the club, chicks in the back<br/>
Some smokin on weed, some sippin Co-gnac<br/>
Into the club, whole crew to the back<br/>
Super the stars make it sharp as a tack<br/>
Gotta have my forty-five inch in it<br/>
In the house, from the gate, twenty minutes<br/>
Game over and I'm still not finished<br/>
I play haters like V play tennis<br/>
Livin like a motherfuckin Richie Rich nigga<br/>
Got a butler for my Maybach nigga<br/>
White linen, smokin ci-gar<br/>
Lyrics like bullets, tongue like a trigger<br/>
Feelin on your booty<br/>
Tryin to get one of these nice ladies<br/>
to come up to my room and do, me<br/>
Have her man like who's, he<br/>
Was a pimp at birth, first ho was a nurse<br/>
And I'ma be a pimp 'til I'm stretches in a hearse<br/>
Sometimes showbiz is the worst<br/>
I'm blessed with "The Gift &amp; The Curse," whoa<br/>
Shoot ball, now I'm off to the spa<br/>
Fresh and clean, now I'm off in the car<br/>
Got a date with a superstar<br/>
We take lunch, now twelve o'clock<br/>
Hit the mall bout two o'clock<br/>
In the movies bout five o'clock<br/>
Seven o'clock 'til nine o'clock<br/>
we in my crib, my bed, goin non-stop<br/>
This for my project niggaz, widebody Mo' sippers<br/>
Pimps hustlers herb flippers, get, this, money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Gettin this money switchin my whips and my kicks<br/>
Like I'm just addicted to difference you pick what you want from me<br/>
To be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain<br/>
Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes<br/>
It's just insane, is it?  I'm from the district where niggaz<br/>
either in prison or pay visits like in-laws<br/>
So we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw<br/>
We can't help but been lost, what else gon' make that engine roar?<br/>
Lay back in 745, big boy cars, that's all we drive<br/>
Into the club we get all the eyes when you gettin that money my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
TrackMaster remix y'all, Kels and Jigga<br/>
Big chips with Twista y'all, get this money<br/>
<br/>
