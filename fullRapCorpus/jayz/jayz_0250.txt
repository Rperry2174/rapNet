<i>[Hook: Pharrell]</i><br/>
Memph Bleek always smoking that lalala....(Hooo)<br/>
Beanie Sigel always smoking that lalala....(Hooo)<br/>
Neptunes track smoke like lalala... (Hooo)<br/>
It's the ROC baby sing, I lullaby<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit (do you want me to do it?)<br/>
You should come, hang wit me, basically (do you want me to do it?)<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singin' lets go ride tonight, mami (Come on now...Uhhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I know my English ain't as modest as you like<br/>
But come, get some, you little bums<br/>
I take the cake from under the baker's thumbs<br/>
I bake the cake get two of them for one<br/>
Then I move the +weight+ like I'm +Oprah's  son+<br/>
Uhhh, I show you how to do this son<br/>
Young don't mess wit chicks in Burberry paddings<br/>
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (un-uh)<br/>
He padded hisself the rap JFK, you wanna pass for my Jacqueline Onassis<br/>
Then hop ya ass out that S-class<br/>
Lay back in that maebach, roll the best grass, I ask...<br/>
Have you in your long-legged life<br/>
ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice? (uhh)<br/>
Look but don't touch, motherfucker think twice<br/>
Cause the gat that I clutch got a little red light<br/>
Need a light?...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
To smoke that lalala...(Hooo)<br/>
Beanie Sigel always smoking that lalala....(Hooo)<br/>
Memph Bleek always smoking that lalala....(Hooo)<br/>
It's the ROC mami sing I lullaby<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We got brothers full of Arme, mamis in Manolo<br/>
Bags by Chanel, Louis Vuitton logos<br/>
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough<br/>
When they see him, whips be European<br/>
If you're a +te-en+ (ten) chances your wit +him+<br/>
If you're a five you know you ridin' wit th-em<br/>
Sick wit the pen nigga, no position in the world could fix him<br/>
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside his affliction<br/>
He's not a sane man, more like Rain Man twitchin'<br/>
You can't rain dance on his picnic<br/>
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness (whoo)<br/>
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you +CB4+<br/>
This ain't +Chris Rock+ bitch, it's the ROC bitch<br/>
And I'm the +franchise+ like a Houston Rocket<br/>
Nawimean (Yao Ming)...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Still smoking that lalala...<br/>
Memph Bleek still smoking that lalala....<br/>
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle to fo' to five....<br/>
It's the ROC baby sing, I lullaby<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Forget English talk body language<br/>
I be all over mamis like body painters<br/>
Pink diamond necklace, strawberry wrist<br/>
Please excuse yourself, you're very sick<br/>
Don't confuse me wit marbury out this bitch<br/>
Run up on me at the light, you could lose your life<br/>
Motherfuckers must be smoking they lalala la crack<br/>
.45 gun smoke, choke off that<br/>
Back to the music, I ain't wit all that<br/>
Plus the feds tappin my music I get all that<br/>
I'm THE public industry number one<br/>
Public industry number two is my whole crew R-O-C<br/>
And I ain't concerned wit' who like me, who like you<br/>
That's gay, I ain't into likin' dudes no way<br/>
But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future<br/>
I never make the news again my man'll shoot ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
As we, smoke that lalala...(Hooo)<br/>
Memphis Bleek always smoking that lalala....(Hooo)<br/>
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle to fo' to five....(Hooo)<br/>
It's the ROC bitch sing, I lullaby<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
Do you want me to do it... come watch me now, uhhh
