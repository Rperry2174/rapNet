Now that all the smoke is gone, lighter<br/>
And the battle's finally won, gimme a lighter<br/>
Victory is finally ours lighter's up, lighter's up<br/>
History so long, so long, so long, so long<br/>
<br/>
In search of victory she keeps saluting me<br/>
If only we can be together momentarily<br/>
We can make love and make history<br/>
Why won't you visit me?<br/>
<br/>
Until she visit me I'll be stuck with her sister<br/>
Her name is defeat, she gives me agony<br/>
So much agony, she brings me so much pain<br/>
So much misery like missing your last shot<br/>
<br/>
And falling to your knees as the crowd screams<br/>
For the other team, I practiced so hard for this moment<br/>
Victory don't leave, I know what this means<br/>
I'm stuck in this routine, whole new different day<br/>
The same old thing<br/>
<br/>
All I got is dreams, nobody else can see<br/>
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me<br/>
Where are you victory? I need you desperately<br/>
Not just for the moment to make history<br/>
<br/>
Now that all the smoke is gone, lighter<br/>
And the battle's finally won, lighter's<br/>
Victory is finally ours<br/>
History so long, so long, so long, so long<br/>
<br/>
So now I'm flirting with death, hustling like a G<br/>
While victory wasn't watching took chances repeatedly<br/>
As a teenage boy before acne<br/>
Before I got proactive I couldn't face she<br/>
<br/>
I just threw on my hoody and headed to the street<br/>
I swear I met success, we lived together shortly<br/>
Now success was like lust, she's good to the touch<br/>
She's good for the moment but she's never enough<br/>
<br/>
Everybody's had her, she's nothing like V<br/>
But success is all I got, unfortunately<br/>
But I'm burning down the block<br/>
Hoping in and out of V<br/>
<br/>
But something tells me that there's much more to see<br/>
Before I get killed 'cause I can't get robbed<br/>
So before me, success and death menage<br/>
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V<br/>
We gotta be together to make history<br/>
<br/>
Now that all the smoke is gone, lighter<br/>
And the battle's finally won lighter's up<br/>
Victory is finally ours, lighter's up<br/>
History so long, so long, so long, so long<br/>
<br/>
Now history is mine, it taste so sweet<br/>
She's my trophy wife, your coming with me<br/>
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly<br/>
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me<br/>
<br/>
He's my legacy, son I'm a hard work<br/>
Future of my past, he'll explain who I be<br/>
Rank me among the greats, either 1, 2 or 3<br/>
If I ain't number one then I failed you victory<br/>
<br/>
Ain't in it for the fame that dies in within weeks<br/>
Ain't in it for the money, can't take me when you leave<br/>
I wanna be remembered long after you breathe<br/>
Long after I'm gone, long after I breathe<br/>
<br/>
I leave all I am in the hands of history<br/>
That's my last will, testimony<br/>
This is much more than a song, it's a baby shower<br/>
I've been waiting for this hour, history you're ours<br/>
<br/>
Now that all the smoke is gone<br/>
And the battle's finally won<br/>
Victory is finally ours<br/>
History so long, so long, so long, so long<br/>
<br/>
Now that all the smoke is gone<br/>
And the battle's finally won<br/>
Victory is finally ours<br/>
History so long, so long, so long, so long
