<i>[Intro: News Excerpts]</i> <br/>
The damage here along the gulf coast is catastrophic.<br/>
There's a frantic effort under way tonight to find<br/>
survivors. There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight... <br/>
People are being forced to live like animals... <br/>
We are desperate... <br/>
No one says the federal government is doing a good job.. <br/>
And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people... <br/>
No water, I fought my country for years.. <br/>
We need help, we really need help.. <br/>
In Baghdad, they they drop, they air drop water, food to people..why cant they do that to their own people? <br/>
The same idiots that can't get water into a major American city in less than three days are trying to<br/>
win a war... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]</i> <br/>
People was poor before the hurricane came <br/>
But the down pour poured is like when Mary J. sang <br/>
Every day it rains, so every day the pain <br/>
But ignored them, and showed em the risk was to blame <br/>
For life is a chain, cause and effected <br/>
Niggas off the chain because they affected <br/>
It's a dirty game so whatever is effective <br/>
From weed to selling kane, gotta put that in effect <br/>
Wouldn't you loot, if you didn't have the loot? <br/>
Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof <br/>
Helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop <br/>
Through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you <br/>
The next five days, no help ensued <br/>
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge <br/>
The commander-in-chief just flew by <br/>
Did he stop? No, he had a couple seats <br/>
Just proved jet blue he's not <br/>
Jet flew by the spot <br/>
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped <br/>
hu,That woulda been something to watch <br/>
Helicopters doing fly-bys to take a couple of shots <br/>
Couple of portraits then ignored 'em <br/>
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids <br/>
Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids <br/>
Left 'em on they porches same old story in New Orleans <br/>
Silly rappers, because we got a couple Porches <br/>
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses <br/>
We forget the unfortunate <br/>
Sure I ponied up a mill, but I didn't give my time <br/>
So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn <br/>
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded <br/>
Nothin' but a bandit <br/>
Left them folks abandoned <br/>
Damn, that money that we gave was just a band-aid <br/>
Can't say we better off than we was before <br/>
In synopsis this is my minority report <br/>
Can't say we better off than we was before <br/>
In synopsis this is my minority report <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Ne-Yo]</i> <br/>
So many times I'm, covering my eyes <br/>
Peeking through my fingers <br/>
Tryin' to hide my, frustration at the way that we treat <br/>
(Seems like we don't even care) <br/>
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain <br/>
Sayin' such a shame <br/>
Then tryin' to go on with my life <br/>
Of that, I too, am guilty <br/>
(Seems like we don't even care) <br/>
So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's alright <br/>
To be able to sleep at night <br/>
You will pay that price <br/>
While some of these folks' lost their whole life <br/>
(Seems like we don't even care) <br/>
Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more <br/>
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no more <br/>
In the end almost nothing changed <br/>
What the hell, what was that for? <br/>
(Seems like we don't even care) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: News Excerpts]</i> <br/>
...Buses are on the way to take those people from New Orleans to Houston <br/>
...They lyin' <br/>
...People are dying at the convention center <br/>
...Their government has failed them <br/>
...George Bush doesn't care about black people
