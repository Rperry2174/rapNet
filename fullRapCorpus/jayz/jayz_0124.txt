<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Jay-Z this, Jay-Z that (Jay-Z won't hold my hand no more)<br/>
Jay-Z this, Jay-Z that<br/>
Jay-Z that, Jay-Z this (Jay-Z won't give me no money)<br/>
Get off Jay-Z dick<br/>
What y'all niggas get front page articles, y'all mention Jay-Z name<br/>
(This thing on?)  Jay-Z, Jay-Z, in Jay-Z news<br/>
I understand what y'all trying to do<br/>
I brought the flutes this time, though<br/>
I unleashed the flutes on them, guru<br/>
Gimme some more music in the headphone<br/>
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening<br/>
Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
H, O V A<br/>
I got my mojo back baby, oh behave<br/>
Naw, naw, don't be afraid<br/>
Y'all and your articles, hard to spit at Jay<br/>
Y'all from afar threw thoughts my way<br/>
What you thought, I would naught have nothing to say?  Nope!<br/>
Y'all fell into the booby trap<br/>
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now<br/>
And now you'se can't leave<br/>
You opened the door god, I'm at you annually<br/>
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez<br/>
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is<br/>
But you can't give cred to anything dude says<br/>
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head<br/>
(Shortyyyy!)  It's time to wake up the dead<br/>
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
H, O V A<br/>
The Blueprint 2 baby, on the way<br/>
H, O V A<br/>
I got my mojo back baby, oh behave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Can't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes<br/>
Prophesizing on your CDs and tapes<br/>
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes<br/>
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?<br/>
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine<br/>
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line<br/>
Donating proceeds off every ticket sold<br/>
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?<br/>
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed myself?<br/>
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help<br/>
They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude<br/>
To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects<br/>
These dudes is all politics, depositing checks<br/>
they put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip<br/>
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype<br/>
Cause the nigga wear a coofie, it don't mean that he bright<br/>
Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice<br/>
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write<br/>
Is it "Oochie Wally Wally" or is it "One Mic"?<br/>
Is it "Black Girl Lost" or shorty owe you for ice?<br/>
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit<br/>
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat<br/>
But I will not lose, for even in defeat<br/>
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens it up for me<br/>
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show<br/>
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though<br/>
Saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes<br/>
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa<br/>
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me<br/>
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history<br/>
Who you know flow vicious as me?<br/>
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov<br/>
I get the spoils cause the victor is me (me, nigga)<br/>
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be<br/>
The street dreamin, all y'all niggas living through me<br/>
I gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee<br/>
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me<br/>
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee<br/>
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen God you a flea<br/>
And the little homey Jungle is a garden to me<br/>
What's the problem B?  You not as hard as me<br/>
Nigga hard as we, nigga R O C, nigga<br/>
That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga<br/>
I won't rest till you on one knee<br/>
You want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga<br/>
Until you on one knee, you want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga<br/>
<br/>
