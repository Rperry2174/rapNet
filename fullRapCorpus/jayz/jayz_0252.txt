The most amazing feeling I feel<br/>
Words can't describe what I'm feeling for real<br/>
Maybe I paint the sky blue<br/>
My greatest creation was you<br/>
You, Glory<br/>
<br/>
False alarms and false starts<br/>
All made better by the sound of your heart<br/>
All the pain of the last time<br/>
I prayed so hard it was the last time<br/>
Your mama said that you danced for her<br/>
Did you wiggle your hands for her?<br/>
Glory! Glory! Glory! Sorry...<br/>
Everything that I prayed for<br/>
God's gift, I wish I would've prayed more<br/>
God makes no mistakes, I made a few<br/>
Rough sledding here and there, but I made it through<br/>
I wreak havoc on the world<br/>
Get ready for part two<br/>
A younger, smarter faster me<br/>
So a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of B<br/>
Glory, yeah<br/>
<br/>
The most amazing feeling I feel<br/>
Words can't describe what I'm feeling for real<br/>
Maybe I paint the sky blue<br/>
My greatest creation was you<br/>
<br/>
Your grand pop died of liquor failure<br/>
Then he died of liver failure<br/>
Deep down he was a good man<br/>
God damn I can't deliver failure<br/>
Bad ass little Hov,<br/>
Two years old shopping on Saville Row<br/>
Wicked ass little Bey, hard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me<br/>
The most beautiful-est thing in this world,<br/>
Is Daddy’s little girl.<br/>
You don’t yet know what swag is<br/>
But you was made in Paris<br/>
And mama woke up the next day<br/>
And shot her album package<br/>
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic<br/>
We was afraid you disappeared<br/>
But nah, baby you magic<br/>
Today you have it, shit happens<br/>
Make sure the plane you on is bigger<br/>
Than your carry-on baggage<br/>
Everybody produced her<br/>
Life is a gift love, open it up<br/>
You're a child of destiny<br/>
You're a child of my destiny<br/>
You're my child with the child from Destiny's Child<br/>
That's a hell of a recipe<br/>
Glory! Glory! Glory! Sorry...<br/>
<br/>
The most amazing feeling I feel<br/>
Words can't describe what I'm feeling for real<br/>
Maybe I paint the sky blue<br/>
My greatest creation was you<br/>
You, you, you...
