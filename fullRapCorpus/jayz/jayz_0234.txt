<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<i>[Movie audio]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
One hundred dollar bills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Benjamin Franklins filled, folded just for the thrill<br/>
Go numb until I can't feel, or might pop this pill<br/>
Stock markets just crash, now I'm just a bill<br/>
History don't repeat itself it rhymes, 1929 still<br/>
Write like Mark Twain, Jay Gatsby, I park things<br/>
Yellow cars, yellow gold like Slick Rick<br/>
Still tip on four-four's (Who?)<br/>
Four-four's at the 4-0, (Wait), for O<br/>
Dollars fall on the skin, some might call it sin<br/>
Politicians all move for money, what the hell are we callin' them?<br/>
Low life, I'm crawlin' out, 911 I Porsched it out<br/>
Y'all niggas so hypocrites, y'all know what this shit is all about<br/>
100 dolla, 100 dolla bill real, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<i>[Movie audio]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
New heroines, new Marilyns<br/>
Move coke through Maryland<br/>
Through Easton, oh you beastin'<br/>
Move fat packs, Jack Gleason<br/>
The honeymoon's over with the streets, yeah<br/>
Least see my kids on the weekend<br/>
Carter, new Kennedy<br/>
No ordinary Joe, you'll remember me<br/>
No prohibition for my coalition<br/>
Colin Powell, general admission<br/>
You're all welcome, new Malcolm of the talcum<br/>
By any means, AK lookin' out the window screen<br/>
Let's get it on, new Marvin<br/>
Who wanna become my 100th problem?<br/>
Semi-automatic or revolver, semi-automatic I'll solve em<br/>
Einstein, my mind, this MC move white squares with my relatives<br/>
That cheese made us constipated couldn't tell us shit<br/>
Took that, Taylor Swift to a hundred fucking million, bitch<br/>
I'm a let ya'll continue but... haha...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I need a 100 bricks on them 100 blocks<br/>
I got a 100 drops, took 100 cops, uh<br/>
100 blocks, I need a 100 bricks on them 100 blocks, uh<br/>
Decade of decadence, ill reveverence, ill reverence<br/>
Decade of decadence, ill reveverence, ill reverence<br/>
Uh, young, uh<br/>
I need a 100 bricks on them 100 blocks<br/>
I got a 100, I got a 100 drops<br/>
Need a 100, got a 100<br/>
Got a 100, 100, uh<br/>
100 dollar bill, real
