<i>[Memphis]</i><br/>
Yeah, check it<br/>
Yo yeah I smoke weed now I don't give a fuck<br/>
And I also tote guns in case my dram pop up<br/>
It's crew love I spit two at every few thugs<br/>
Fo doves blow dubs holdin eight snub<br/>
I hold it down my strip, goin nowhere<br/>
Flip two eightballs trick the dough on low gear<br/>
The next week two O's gone<br/>
Nigga don't prolong<br/>
Play the studio and get my flow on<br/>
And sell weight on a later base<br/>
My older brother kept guns on his waist in case he air the place<br/>
And walk straight up on you fuckin crooked niggaz<br/>
Comin out ya mouth sideways like some rookie niggaz<br/>
I drink Henny mixed wit nothing<br/>
My weed and the dutch is somethin<br/>
What you niggaz sayin nuttin<br/>
It's Bleek, controllin these streets holdin the heat<br/>
Reportin for my live niggaz just like me WHAT<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Haha this is Roc-A-Fella for life<br/>
This is Roc-A-Fella for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You know it's crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die<br/>
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by<br/>
We could stack dough sky-high<br/>
Niggaz can't touch what they can't feel real recognize real<br/>
Crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die<br/>
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by<br/>
We could stack dough sky-high<br/>
Niggaz can't touch what they can't feel real recognize real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Siegel]</i><br/>
Yo, I set up shop wit nick rocks that'll upset rookies<br/>
Make 'em slide like li'l dicks in wet pussy<br/>
Open up the whole strip, like Monopoly<br/>
Dare one of ya'll to land on my property<br/>
Think you get some dough for my community chest?<br/>
Blaow blaow two to yo chest<br/>
Ya'll niggaz can't pass go cuz it cost to pass<br/>
Ya'll niggaz cheap like Baltic Ave.<br/>
Type ta land on jail can't pay your bail<br/>
Wanna borrow from the bank, nigga what you think<br/>
I'm the wrong one to lie to<br/>
Shit I'm the man who supply who supply who supply YOU<br/>
And ya'll a bunch talk money<br/>
I'm tryin to get it down for that motherfuckin boardwalk money<br/>
Two-brick money new blue six money<br/>
Paroo trip money flew in six money<br/>
Taj Mahal trips orange chips money<br/>
Long dick money all in yo bitch money<br/>
Flow like the flu and spit sick money<br/>
Peep hotty's Roc-A-Fella wools route<br/>
All black mask down wit they tools out<br/>
Beanie mack I'll move out<br/>
I had niggaz runnin from school pickin new routes<br/>
Then I'll run and lick a shot make 'em move south<br/>
Switch up they last name get a new spouse<br/>
Scrambled up some down-payment for a new house<br/>
No matter where you go Mack gone find ya<br/>
I'm like a shadow nigga I'm right behind ya<br/>
I'll blow out ya brains and won't give ya no reminder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis]</i><br/>
Me and my road dog<br/>
Been OG's for so long<br/>
Spit raw rolled up niggaz can smoke on<br/>
Shit I let 'em have it you faggots ain't know my status<br/>
Fuckin with my mathematics you make us savage<br/>
Five nine one six O, light brown<br/>
M-E-M-P-H-I-S Bleek put it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Its crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die<br/>
As long as you and I keep it movin, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie]</i><br/>
Aiyyo I pray to the God MC to bless me<br/>
Wit a ill ass flow and sick ass dough<br/>
Where it don't make no sense that hundreds and cents and<br/>
Thousands of dollars ice freezes my collar<br/>
Where I need a turtle-neck to rock my check<br/>
And a pair of isotoners to rock my rings<br/>
Get the signin bonus know mack toppin them thangs<br/>
Flip twice rip that crew then I'm droppin my thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Nigga it's crew love
