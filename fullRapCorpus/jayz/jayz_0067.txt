<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Geah.. whassup?<br/>
Where's all my street niggaz, project niggaz<br/>
Real niggaz, worldwide<br/>
Let's reflect.. e'rybody got a story<br/>
We all ghetto B - here's mine <br/>
Geah<br/>
<br/>
See I was -- born in sewage, born to make bomb music<br/>
Flow tight like I was born Jewish<br/>
Used the streets as a conduit - I kept arms <br/>
38 longs inside my mom's Buick<br/>
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news<br/>
Iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid<br/>
Shit, I'm goin through it - mom dukes too<br/>
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it<br/>
My life is gettin too wild<br/>
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it<br/>
Bout to lose it; voices screamin "Don't do it!"<br/>
It's like '93, '94, bout the year <br/>
that Big and Mag dropped; and "Illmatic" rocked <br/>
outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked<br/>
Everybody doin 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block<br/>
like "Damn; I'ma be a failure"<br/>
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug - paraphenalia<br/>
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us<br/>
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts<br/>
Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin<br/>
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!<br/>
It gets worse, baby momma water burst<br/>
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on<br/>
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb<br/>
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be -- soon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This can't be life, this can't be love<br/>
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us<br/>
This can't be life, this can't be love<br/>
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Chill dog<br/>
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother<br/>
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother<br/>
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another<br/>
I'm thinkin damn; how my older sister gon' make me tougher<br/>
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real<br/>
I'm tired of tryin to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills<br/>
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real<br/>
Y'all niggaz thinkin what y'all readin in The Source is real<br/>
What my life like, you lookin at the source, it's real<br/>
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real<br/>
Passin judgment, you niggaz second-guessin Beans<br/>
Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Amin<br/>
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an<br/>
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine<br/>
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body<br/>
Make 'em feel feel hell on earth before Allah drop thee<br/>
I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me<br/>
Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me<br/>
There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans<br/>
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin<br/>
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog<br/>
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog<br/>
I come back in the afterlife<br/>
Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meanin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Scarface]</i><br/>
Yeah.. uhh..<br/>
Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with Jig'<br/>
I got a phone call from one of my nigs<br/>
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids<br/>
And when I heard that I just broke into tears<br/>
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is<br/>
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib<br/>
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news<br/>
Now we both depressed, countin our blessings cause Brad's two<br/>
Prayin for young souls to laugh atlife through the stars<br/>
Lovin your kids just like you was ours<br/>
And I'm hurtin for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours<br/>
I just know that heaven'll open these doors<br/>
And ain't no bright side to losin lifel; but you can view it like this <br/>
God's got open hands homey, he in the midst.. of good company<br/>
Who loves all and hates not one<br/>
And one day you gon' be wit your son<br/>
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song<br/>
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong<br/>
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love <br/>
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us<br/>
This can't be life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This can't be life..
