<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, uhh, let's go<br/>
Uhh, bounce, uhh, bounce<br/>

Shit relax your mind, let your conscience be free<br/>
You're now rollin with them thugs from the R-O-C<br/>
Sigel Sigel in the house<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Uh-huh, sick bastard<br/>
Get your wig pushed back by the wig push-backer<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, Memph Bleek in the house<br/>

Uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh-UHH, uhh<br/>
Young Hova in the house.. Jigga! Yeah<br/>
Crist' sipper, six dipper, wrist splitter nigga!<br/>
.. hold up love<br/>
Everytime you see Jigga Man I'm rollin on dubs<br/>
Don't forget about them blades shit choppin it up<br/>
It's the motherfuckin Roc bitch, who hotter than us?<br/>
Jay-Hov, bout to change my name to Jay Peso<br/>
But in the meantime, call me William H. though<br/>
On the platinum Yamaha, got the engine gunnin<br/>
Throwin it up like liquor on an empty stomach<br/>
{cycle whizzes by} Y'all don't hear nuttin?<br/>
Who that, Mac?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Nah dawg, that's M. Bleek comin<br/>

<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Who the FLUCK, want, what?<br/>
Catch Bleek in South Beach out of the reach of the police<br/>
Gat on my lap (yeah) bitch on my back (holla)<br/>
Yak in my pocket, smokin the sticky chocolate (OO-WEE!)<br/>
Holla if you want drama with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
The Dynasty; Amil, Bleek, Jigga and.. Sigel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Desert Eagle dawg, who else but me?<br/>
Roc ears, Roc-Wears, bandannas and white tees<br/>
Me without a gun dawg, unlikely<br/>
You know I keep the heat right under the wifebeat'<br/>
Three-X-T, I'm Lincoln now, you can't see the pound<br/>
Got a little gut so gat sit tucked (fuck)<br/>
I run wild, gun high, L.A. style<br/>
Bang the roscoe to the sunrise, plus I stay dumb high<br/>
Whether block shit or rock shit<br/>
Club shit or drug shit, I pop shit I got shit<br/>
Get Sig' any track I'ma spit the talk to it<br/>
Down South all bounce Crips gon' walk to it<br/>
Get a ounce, get a woods, everybody spark to it<br/>
Every dawg, every Blood in the hood, bark to it<br/>
Get the ounce, get the woods, everybody spark to it<br/>
We can smoke in here, put the choke in the air<br/>
<br/>

Young Hova in the house.. Jigga!<br/>
Crist' sipper, six dipper, wrist splitter nigga!<br/>
<br/>
I wear more bling to The Source and Soul Train's<br/>
More chains than rings, niggaz won't do a thing<br/>
I bangs the four-four in plain, daylight I'm deranged<br/>
Spray right at your brain; by the way this is Hov'<br/>
One shot Dillinger, one shot killin ya<br/>
It's only one Roc La Familia<br/>
Sigel lock Philly up, Brooklyn is me<br/>
Matter of fact, the East coast fuck took it from me<br/>
Fourth album still Jay still spittin that real shit<br/>
Volume 3 still sold more records than Will Smith<br/>
Can't call this a comeback, I run rap, the fuck is y'all sayin?<br/>
Five million I done that, and I come back, to do it again (uh-huh)<br/>
Ex-sinner, Grammy award winner<br/>
Ballin repeatedly, highlights on Sportscenter<br/>
Please repeat after me - there's only one rule<br/>
I WILL NOT, LOSE!
