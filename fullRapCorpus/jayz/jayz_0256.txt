I'm a new soul<br/>
I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take<br/>
I'm I'm I'm a new soul<br/>
I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take<br/>
I'm I'm new soul <br/>
I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take take take take take<br/>
<br/>
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol<br/>
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed<br/>
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"<br/>
I'm from the hood stupid what type of facts are those<br/>
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos<br/>
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough<br/>
I'm like fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole<br/>
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward<br/>
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show<br/>
They don't play my hits well I don't give a shit SO<br/>
Rap mags try and use my black ass<br/>
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads...fuckers<br/>
I don't know what you take me as<br/>
or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has<br/>
I'm from rags to riches nigga I ain't dumb<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
<br/>
I'm I'm I'm I'm a new soul<br/>
I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take<br/>
I'm I'm I'm a new soul<br/>
I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take take take take take<br/>
<br/>
The year is '94 and in my trunk is raw<br/>
In my rear view mirror is the mother fucking law<br/>
I got two choices yall pull over the car or<br/>
bounce on the double put the pedal to the floor<br/>
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with jake<br/>
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case<br/>
So I...pull over to the side of the road<br/>
And I heard "Son do you know why I'm stopping you for?"<br/>
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low<br/>
Do I look like a mind reader sir, I don't know<br/>
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo?<br/>
"Well you was doing fifty five in a fifty four"<br/>
"License and registration and step out of the car"<br/>
"Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are"<br/>
I ain't stepping out of shit all my papers legit<br/>
"Do you mind if I look round the car a little bit?"<br/>
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back<br/>
And I know my rights so you gon' need a warrant for that<br/>
"Aren't you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something?"<br/>
"Or somebody important or something?"<br/>
Nah I ain't passed the bar but I know a little bit<br/>
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit<br/>
"Well see how smart you are when the K-9's come"<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
<br/>
I'm I'm I'm I'm a new soul<br/>
I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take<br/>
I'm I'm I'm a new soul<br/>
I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
