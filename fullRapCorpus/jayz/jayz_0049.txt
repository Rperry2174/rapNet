<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Bounce<br/>
Uhhh, ha, uhhh, ha<br/>
Uhhh, uh-huh-uh-uhhh, uhh, uh-huh<br/>
This for my hustlers.. uh-huh<br/>
And for the bitches.. yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo<br/>
This is for my niggaz down in Houston on candy paint<br/>
All my niggaz in the Dirty South, Miami mayne<br/>
All my niggaz in the A-T-L throwin dem bones<br/>
All them thugs that send slugs through your clothes; holla at me<br/>
It's for the black culture, Spanish chicks with the sweet chocha<br/>
Spanish cats with the ki's of cocoa<br/>
All the haters eat a dick they wanna see you brok-er<br/>
I hope the heat stroke ya, the misery is over<br/>
All my deep smokers, I hope the leaf choke ya<br/>
Hope you'll never be sober I'ma toast to myself<br/>
I hope the Crist' get me, spiralin into a tizzy<br/>
So pissy, swervin on the road dizzy<br/>
May God protect my soul, angels walk with me<br/>
First do the flow sickly, niggaz is so shifty<br/>
The fo'-fo' is like a force field, you won't get me<br/>
I brought some folk with me, Brooklyn is loc'n with me<br/>
What the fuck?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Juvenile repeat 2X]</i><br/>
You know, we ride<br/>
All day, all night<br/>
Pop Crist, shoot dice<br/>
Fuck hoes, for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This is for my chicks that get dough for takin off they clothes<br/>
All them money makin honeys that slide down the poles<br/>
All my educated chicks who grade is 4.0<br/>
All the baby mamas across the globe; aiyyo<br/>
I like my women friends feminine<br/>
I like my hoes on "X" like Eminem.. shit!<br/>
I like em bow-legged, never coke-headed<br/>
With a dough fetish - the drive to go get it<br/>
I like they toes proper, I like they clothes Prada<br/>
I like they shoes Gucci, I like new coochie<br/>
I fucked a few groupies, in a few hoopties<br/>
I got em iceberg shit they thought I knew Snoopy<br/>
I cop them Roc-a-Wear, my mamis dedicated<br/>
They never tell me no, the most they said is "not here"<br/>
I got they ears studded, both wrists baguetted<br/>
I got a main chick, a mistress, and a young bitch<br/>
Forget it I'm the don<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Wha-What?<br/>
This is for my dice shooters, cats doin life<br/>
By the time I get this kite to ya, I hope you doin alright<br/>
Who got em platinum up? Who got the chicks in the truck?<br/>
Too much to sit comfortably, they lappin up<br/>
Who shit is big pimpin? See the flow different<br/>
I drop heavy then I let the four-fifth flip em<br/>
I keep rappers talkin to kids, Jigga "Sixth Sense-d" em<br/>
Don't mention my name and lames in the same sentence<br/>
You see I'm so thorough, take on your whole borough<br/>
Be so careful I hear the whistle from the fo'-fo' barrel<br/>
Keep the flow Hovah; icy neck, cold shoulder<br/>
Who click is closest to La Costra Nostra?<br/>
It's "The Roc"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1.5X]</i>
