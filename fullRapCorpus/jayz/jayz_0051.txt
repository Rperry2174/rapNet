<i>[Amil (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
(Alright yeah)<br/>
Would ya love me? (Uh-huh, alright)<br/>
Would ya hate me? (Watch this yo)<br/>
I know ya love me (Alright)<br/>
I know ya hate me (Uh Clue)<br/>
Would ya love me? (Brand new Duro)<br/>
Would ya hate me?<br/>
I know ya love me (Feel this yo, uh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amil]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, uh<br/>
See me comin through hair done just a slinging my shit<br/>
With something Gucci on clinging to my hips<br/>
Frontin with the Star Tech ringing in the whip<br/>
Icy ears, neck, fingers for years<br/>
Got the show wild with the toes out<br/>
Shit I don't fuck with no stingy nigga<br/>
I rock Prada, Chanel, and Fendi nigga<br/>
What I'mma do with your little blunts and Henney nigga?<br/>
I'mma Major Coin with a pretty Bentley nigga<br/>
Uh my niggas will ride for me<br/>
You should see all the things they buy for me<br/>
Uh, it's obvious how I spend my time<br/>
Around ballers all day don't have to spend a dime<br/>
Callin' up room service when it's dinner time<br/>
Get my tan on in the tropics in the winter time nigga, uh, uh, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amil (Beanie Siegal)]</i><br/>
Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)<br/>
Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)<br/>
I know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 Roc)<br/>
I know ya hate me (Cuz you know we got shit locked)<br/>
Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)<br/>
Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)<br/>
I know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 Roc)<br/>
I know ya hate me (And you know we got shit locked)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Siegal]</i><br/>
Ay yo, we gon' stop this here<br/>
Get this clear the general of the Roc in here<br/>
Beanie Siegal hottest thing on the block this year<br/>
Keep the ego we been bound to the top ya hear<br/>
Forget about it you don't know me yo stop the stares<br/>
I've been about it pop you then pop ya peers<br/>
You know how I do six coup, top be clear<br/>
You know how I play low layer Roc-A-Wear<br/>
Catch Siegal in the kitchen balloon in the pie<br/>
Y'all from whom to buy<br/>
Y'all niggas know if y'all cross Mac<br/>
Y'all soon to die<br/>
Cuz you know I bring heat like June and July<br/>
Spit like August<br/>
I'm the truth I'm not lying<br/>
I'm the reason why Jay feel comfortable retiring<br/>
I gotta laugh cuz y'all work hard at this shit<br/>
Think about yo I just started this shit<br/>
Just imagine if I put my heart in this shit<br/>
Scary sight y'all niggas feel me right<br/>
God damn yo I barely write<br/>
But every rhyme be in check like a pair of Nikes<br/>
<br/>

Would ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)<br/>
Would ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)<br/>
I know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 roc)<br/>
I know ya hate me (And you know we got shit locked)<br/>

<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, well I'm gold now<br/>
Memph Man Coming Of Age and I'm grown now<br/>
Sittin on chrome now<br/>
I'm the youngest gun, I get it on with anyone<br/>
I've been in thirty beefs shit I'm barely 21<br/>
Guns I hold em like offensive linemen<br/>
Bring em back to the streets like a brick on consignment<br/>
Interlining of the Mark Buchanan<br/>
Spark two hammers<br/>
Memph Man gold marks the understanding<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We don't engage in war we elope<br/>
Orange juice style beat niggas to a pulp<br/>
We broke nigga you just told 3 jokes<br/>
Me, Biggs, and Dame we get some things<br/>
See the six dames me and Biggs live in the Range<br/>
Mine's platinum his Champagne<br/>
Niggas whisper cuz if they talk they gets slain<br/>
Y'all's was looking for me on the charts the bricks came<br/>
Left the same night in the morning the chicks came<br/>
I just use rap to put shit in my name<br/>
The death's just a matter of time the hit's been arranged<br/>
Contracts signed the shits in your name<br/>
Just to lame rap niggas I'm the king<br/>
Motherfuck the ring mami kiss the chain<br/>
I don't got game to waste on y'all<br/>
I'm don't think with my dick or chase my balls<br/>
I'm a hustla hit me with an eighth of raw<br/>
And when I get on top I'mma blaze all y'all<br/>
Keep em laced some more I know you want some things<br/>
I drink a lot of water mami come clean<br/>
Chicks I pump her then dump her<br/>
Cars we got em bumper to bumper<br/>
Rap niggas y'all days are numbered<br/>
Nobody drop nothin' next summer, yeah<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
