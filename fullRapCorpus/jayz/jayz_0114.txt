<i>[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
And we gonna stay hustling on that block until we caught<br/>
And we gonna stay showing off that jewelry that we bought<br/>
And we gonna stay leaving out the stores with heavy bags<br/>
Cause we poppin tags, pimping we be poppin tags!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We arose, let's go<br/>
"So Fresh So Clean" like 'Kast<br/>
Jay-Z be popping tags<br/>
Leaving the mall with heavy bags<br/>
You know the boy got a love for the cash<br/>
Aw fuck, there he go again<br/>
Talking about hoes and dough again<br/>
Yup! â€” Can't hold it in<br/>
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend<br/>
But, back when I was poorer then<br/>
You wasn't focusing, about the dough I spend<br/>
But I was holding in, I was a roller then<br/>
I was a baller back then, all of that man<br/>
Fall back, I fought that<br/>
What would you do if you was in my shoes?<br/>
Leave dudes in the rearview<br/>
V-12 engine, corners spinning<br/>
Twinkies shining, pinky ring<br/>
Armadale, nigga stinky stink<br/>
Top, down, my cash is up<br/>
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma<br/>
That's right, you in luck ma<br/>
You see me cruising down, better step inside<br/>
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride<br/>
First come, first served basis<br/>
You know Hov' be goin to nice places<br/>
That's right, and I'm droppin cash<br/>
Leave the mall with garbage bags<br/>
Gucci this, Prada that<br/>
Roll with you boy you'll be popping tags<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Twista]</i><br/>
It's a party when I go up in the store<br/>
Shoppin while I'm zooted off the dro'<br/>
Rollin like a nigga that just came up on a mill'<br/>
and I got 'em sweeping and pickin up tags off the floor<br/>
Bag full of clothes I remember having rocks in the hall<br/>
on the glimmer with the glock by the ball<br/>
Serving up a jab and working security 6 to 6<br/>
Then it's straight from the block to the mall<br/>
Now what's on the wall? Go ahead and treat yourself<br/>
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag<br/>
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off<br/>
to the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag<br/>
I got a console full of ammunition and funds<br/>
Mink Roc-a-Wear and some guns<br/>
Petty in a fresh pair of jumps, blo-packs and Bo Jax<br/>
and Air Maxes, throw back some ones, no max for none<br/>
(When I go up in the store a nigga never get enough)<br/>
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now<br/>
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)<br/>
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now<br/>
I be choppin up cheddar with Kanye<br/>
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay<br/>
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay<br/>
Poppin big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Killer Mike]</i><br/>
Uh-huh, what's up? Tell you something about me..<br/>
My throwback game is whiffle wicked<br/>
Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number 20 Mark Spitz'n<br/>
Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin Nu*Wear fitted<br/>
White boys say my style is bitchin<br/>
Keeping coke in the kitchen<br/>
Keep a glock that will shock and bring the rest<br/>
tucked underneath my Mitchell and Ness<br/>
I, travelling, handling with a forty-five cannon<br/>
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan<br/>
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin<br/>
Two deep by Pelle Pelle<br/>
Westside how they felly fell<br/>
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather<br/>
worn by the great Rakim himself<br/>
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand<br/>
I leave your blood squirting<br/>
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest<br/>
of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings<br/>
I been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket<br/>
since the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets<br/>
I slept with a package, under mattress<br/>
I carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words<br/>
I'll put something hot through your motherfucking iceberg<br/>
Got a project chica, named Rica<br/>
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer<br/>
Small, pinkies like that<br/>
Talk 'til the paper fat<br/>
I rock somethin, roll chief +Sacks+ like Daddy Fat!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: Big Boi]</i><br/>
Pop tires in reverse, you'll be needin a nurse<br/>
Leave you laying on your back in a Cadillac hearse<br/>
Now your momma in all black with a matchin purse<br/>
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts<br/>
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall<br/>
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off<br/>
Trot to the mailbox thinkin a check but the mail's run short<br/>
No more MD, DD, LD<br/>
That means Movie Date, Dinner Date, Lunch Date, help me please<br/>
My sheets is gone<br/>
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond<br/>
Meticulously pompously serve the song<br/>
Act a damn donkey<br/>
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home<br/>
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone<br/>
Chilling, bags in the trunk full of FAO Schwartz for the chill'uns<br/>
Spent a few shillings<br/>
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kidding<br/>
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and<br/>
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs<br/>
Or are you acting mad cause the money done<br/>
slowed, down, just a little bit<br/>
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit<br/>
Acting like a pitfall bull-pit<br/>
Dead game is the pul-pit<br/>
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped<br/>
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashing<br/>
A miracle happening<br/>
Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin and rhyming and smabbin<br/>
Pop that tag on some of this game<br/>
Holla-tic, swallow and keep the change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
