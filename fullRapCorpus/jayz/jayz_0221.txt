<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Head of the family<br/>
El Padrino<br/>
Welcome home to Emory<br/>
Let's get back to this dinero<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Niggas wanna kidnap wifey<br/>
Good luck with that bruh<br/>
You must gonna hide your whole family<br/>
What you think we wearing black for<br/>
Ready for that war<br/>
Ready for that war ready<br/>
You ain't ready yo, you radio<br/>
You ain't really ready<br/>
Real nigga outchea<br/>
Alpo bought his bricks here<br/>
Elvis got his records took<br/>
It's like we got our seventh gear<br/>
NFL investigations<br/>
Oh, don't make me laugh<br/>
FBI investigation<br/>
We stood up to that<br/>
Facts only<br/>
Everything real in my raps only<br/>
Every nigga real in my clique really<br/>
Everyone is a movie star you got to film me<br/>
La Familia<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Ready for that war<br/>
Ready for that war, ready<br/>
You ain't ready yo, you radio<br/>
You ain't really ready<br/>
Head of the Family<br/>
El Padrino<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
My brothers is my brother like my brother is<br/>
My nigga is my brother<br/>
Like my mother kids<br/>
Not in just in good times<br/>
That's that sucka shit<br/>
But it war times<br/>
It just what it is<br/>
Head of the family<br/>
All my niggas bosses though<br/>
Y'all don't understand we<br/>
We talk that shit bosses know<br/>
Triple fuckin' OG<br/>
What's up to my nigga Juan<br/>
Tell these niggaas pull their fuckin' skirt down<br/>
I could see their ovaries<br/>
Niggas snitching switching teams<br/>
Out there telling bitches things<br/>
Industry talk behind your back<br/>
Ain't nobody got time for that<br/>
Facts only<br/>
Everything real in my raps only<br/>
Every nigga real in my clique really<br/>
Even the girls keep it two hundred and trilly<br/>
It's la familia
