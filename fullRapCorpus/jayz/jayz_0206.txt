<i>[Mr. Hudson]</i><br/>
Let’s dance in style,<br/>
Let’s dance for a while,<br/>
Heaven can wait we’re only watching the skies<br/>
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,<br/>
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?<br/>
Let us die young or let us live forever,<br/>
We don’t have the power but we never say never,<br/>
Sitting in a sandpit,<br/>
Life is a short trip,<br/>
The music’s for the sad man,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Forever young,<br/>
I wanna be forever young<br/>
Do you really want to live forever?<br/>
Forever and ever<br/>
Forever young I wanna be<br/>
Forever young<br/>
Do you really want to live forever?<br/>
Forever, forever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
So we live a life like a video<br/>
When the sun is always out and you never get old<br/>
And the champagne’s always cold<br/>
And the music is always good<br/>
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood<br/>
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car<br/>
Without a wrinkle in today<br/>
Cuz there is no tomorrow<br/>
Just some picture perfect day<br/>
To last a whole lifetime<br/>
And it never ends<br/>
Cos all we have to do is hit rewind<br/>
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,<br/>
Drink some wine,<br/>
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind<br/>
Leave a mark that can’t erase neither space nor time<br/>
So when the director yells cut,<br/>
I’ll be fine,<br/>
I’m forever young...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Fear not when, fear not why,<br/>
Fear not much while were alive,<br/>
Life is for living not living up tight,<br/>
See ya somewhere up in the sky,<br/>
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye,<br/>
So not for legends, I'm forever young<br/>
My name shall survive<br/>
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,<br/>
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations<br/>
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here,<br/>
Shorty, the nigga from here<br/>
With a little ambition just what we can become here,<br/>
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears,<br/>
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah<br/>
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know.<br/>
Don’t ever let me go, thats how you let me know, baby,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Slamming Bentley doors,<br/>
Hopping out of Porsche’s,<br/>
Popping up on Forbes lists,<br/>
Gorgeous,<br/>
Hold up,<br/>
Niggas thought I lost it,<br/>
They be talking bullshit<br/>
I be talking more shit<br/>
They nauseous,<br/>
Hold up,<br/>
I'll be here forever<br/>
You know, I'm on my fall shit,<br/>
And I ain’t waiting for closure, I will never forfeit,<br/>
Less than four bars,<br/>
Guru bring the chorus in,<br/>
Did you get the picture yet,<br/>
I’m painting you a portrait of young...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
