<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I keep it fresher than the next bitch<br/>
no need..for you to ever sweat the next bitch<br/>
..with speed, I make the best bitch see the exit..indeed, <br/>
you gotta know your thoroughly respected by me,<br/>
you get the keys to the Lexus, with no driver<br/>
you gotcha own '96 suh-in..the ride<br/>
and keep your ass tighter than Versace thats why<br/>
you gotta watch your friends you got to watch me<br/>
they conniving shit<br/>
the first chance to crack the bank<br/>
they try me, all they get is 50 cent franks<br/>
and papayas, from the village to the tele<br/>
time to kill it on your belly no question <br/>
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence<br/>
they say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot<br/>
mmet your death in less than 8 seconds<br/>
still poundin in my after life..<br/>
laugin my shit is tight<br/>
you who askin right...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Aint no nigga like the one I got<br/>
no one can fuck you betta<br/>
sleeps around but he gives me alot<br/>
keeps you in diamonds and leathers<br/>
friends 'ill tell me I should leave you alone<br/>
hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah ha<br/>
tell the freaks to find a man of there own<br/>
(man a they own, man a they own)<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Fresh to def in Moschino, coach bag<br/>

surrouding your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan<br/>
I keep ya dove but love <br/>

yall knows how it goes 'b and so I creep<br/>
Ive been sinnin since you been playin wit Barbie and Ken in<br/>

the chrome rim spinning keeps em grinnin<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yo, aint no stoppin this, no lie<br/>

Y'all knows how it goes B so I stay deep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Foxy Brown]</i><br/>
What up boo just keep me laced in the illa snakes<br/>
bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs<br/>
Mackin this bitch, wifee nigga <br/>
so when you flip that coke <br/>
remember them days you was dead broke<br/>
but now your style and I raised you<br/>
basically made you into a don<br/>
flippin weight..heroin and shit<br/>
you know my pussy is all that<br/>
thats why I get bagets 5 carats and all that<br/>
From Dolce Gabana to H Vendell I'm ringin bells<br/>
so who the playa, I still keep you in the illest gators<br/>
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin<br/>
on how I fuck the best a shit<br/>
specially when Im flippin Baileys<br/>
dont give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis<br/>
I push da Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life<br/>
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was<br/>
I got you frontin in Armani sweaters<br/>
before this rap shit <br/>
when you was in letters and bullshit berattas<br/>
and eek classes with mo in the glasses<br/>
shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's<br/>
now all your mens' up in your benz's<br/>
high post, I swear you be killin me<br/>
playin inside my pubic hairs<br/>
I never worry bout them other chicks<br/>
cuz you proved who was your wiz<br/>
when you was spinnin that bitch<br/>
I took a little when you was up north<br/>
your comisary stay pilin<br/>
how you livin large on the island<br/>
all them collects have me vex<br/>
but when you come home <br/>
knew I was comin off wit half of dem checks<br/>
now we on the rise<br/>
your diamond mami wit the slanted eyes<br/>
holdin this grip cocked the green and the shit<br/>
Fucks no, I see half the dough<br/>
Made you into a star, pushin hundred thousand dollar cars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
