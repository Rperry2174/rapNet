Uhh, y'all know what this is<br/>
Now would be a good time to start bobbin your heads<br/>
Kels, and it, and it, uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Excuse me miss, don't mean to interrupt<br/>
But you're the hottest chick in this club<br/>
The way you shake your ass to this beat<br/>
It's like your booty got dancin feet<br/>
I wanna take you home, in my Hummer Jeep<br/>
All over me while you ridin the beep beep<br/>
I just really wanna taste your ice cream<br/>
It's the weekend baby I got the {?}<br/>
Go on girl, the way you do me<br/>
This is somethin like a fantasy<br/>
You're that girl from the magazine<br/>
BET, or, MTV<br/>
So baby let me take you to my ecstasy<br/>
Pull up to the club on them 23's<br/>
Girl you've got that shit in your hip<br/>
that make me wanna spend, money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Pretty girls (where you at)<br/>
I'm talkin to the ones, that came alone<br/>
Pretty girls (put your hands up)<br/>
The single ones, we wanna take you home - c'mon<br/>
Pretty girls... (you make me wanna shout)<br/>
Let's, go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Whether you tall like Lisa Leslie<br/>
Or short like the barrel on that baby 380<br/>
Pretty lady, I got a ride to fit yo' frame<br/>
From the Coupe to the big Mercedes<br/>
{?}, these groundhogs stay with the cash<br/>
And the black card don't got no max<br/>
Fall, back, blow on some Merikesh hash<br/>
With more Manolos than Sarah Jess' had<br/>
How you gon' go back to dudes with little sacks<br/>
Little kiddie chromes in they itty bitty homes<br/>
Fuckin up your lungs, puffin that homegrown<br/>
You should be with us, cuttin in Hong Kong<br/>
Straight shots of Catron or Dom Perignon<br/>
Guys your girls say Shawn very long<br/>
So if you ain't afraid of catchin a love jones<br/>
Get with Coach Dean Smith, bitch get in the zone, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Tell me what you're drinkin at the bar ma<br/>
I'm gonna buy ma, anybody tell you youse a star ma<br/>
You remind me of my car ma, no ignition<br/>
I start the Coupe up from the kitchen<br/>
My pretty girls get plenty attention<br/>
When it come to sex get plenty of inches<br/>
We shop, like we all broke detention<br/>
Club like we at a alcoholic's convention<br/>
Hit the 'tel with two chicks and she with it<br/>
Mama got down like the flo' when she did it<br/>
Pretty girls, keep shakin ass now mama<br/>
This party is not over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
What's your name, what city you represent ma<br/>
Where the hands on all the pretty girls ma<br/>
For the players and the hustlers in the club now<br/>
And all my niggaz that be sippin pimp juice now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
