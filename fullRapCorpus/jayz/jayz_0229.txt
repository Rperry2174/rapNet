<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
My nigga got on<br/>
My nigga got on all white, no socks<br/>
My nigga got that cocaina on today<br/>
That's how he feel<br/>
Turn my vocal up<br/>
That's how you feel, Emory?<br/>
Turn my vocal up some more<br/>
Turn my vocal up, Guru!<br/>
Turn the music up too<br/>
<br/>
Super Bowl goals<br/>
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold<br/>
We in a whole different mode<br/>
Kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed<br/>
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed<br/>
Oh, we gon' reach a billi' first<br/>
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work!<br/>
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all<br/>
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt<br/>
All this old talk left me confused<br/>
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?<br/>
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new<br/>
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z &amp; Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Nobody wins when the family feuds<br/>
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit<br/>
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?<br/>
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute..<br/>
Pretty much<br/>
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us<br/>
Fuck rap, crack cocaine<br/>
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things<br/>
Hundred percent, Black-owned champagne<br/>
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams<br/>
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, huh<br/>
But we ain't get through to you yet, uh<br/>
What's better than one billionaire? Two (two)<br/>
'Specially if they're from the same hue as you<br/>
Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth<br/>
<br/>
I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin'<br/>
But that ain't even a statement<br/>
That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget<br/>
Wait, that ain't politically correct<br/>
Forget it<br/>
Can I get "Amen" from the congregation?<br/>
Amen, amen<br/>
Can I get a "Amen" from the congregation?<br/>
Amen, amen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me<br/>
Let me alone, Becky<br/>
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich<br/>
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit<br/>
My consciousness was Michael's common sense<br/>
I missed the karma and that came as a consequence<br/>
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'<br/>
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain<br/>
Nobody wins when the family feuds<br/>
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools<br/>
I'm tryna fix you<br/>
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official<br/>
Y'all think small, I think Biggie<br/>
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi<br/>
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies<br/>
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?<br/>
Old niggas never accepted me<br/>
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis<br/>
We all lose when the family feuds<br/>
What's better than one billionaire? Two<br/>
I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got CÎROC<br/>
Y'all need to stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Higher, higher, higher, higher<br/>
Higher, higher, higher, higher<br/>
Higher, higher, higher, higher<br/>
Higher, higher, higher, higher<br/>
Higher, higher<br/>
Love me like, love<br/>
Higher<br/>
Like... yeah, yeah, yeah...
