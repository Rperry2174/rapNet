<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Uhh uhh uhh.<br/>
You ready B? Let's go get 'em..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Look for me! Young, B<br/>
Cruisin down the westside - high, way<br/>
Doing what we like to do - our, way<br/>
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason<br/>
all of my dates been blind dates<br/>
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me<br/>
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's trippy how hard<br/>
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney<br/>
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"<br/>
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over<br/>
She's right back to being my soldier<br/>
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller<br/>
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?<br/>
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder<br/>
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused<br/>
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be<br/>
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.<br/>
<i>[Bey]</i> Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.<br/>
<i>[Bey]</i> Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin<br/>
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin<br/>
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin<br/>
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that<br/>
I don't be at, places where we comfy at<br/>
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that<br/>
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is<br/>
But girlfriend, work with the kid<br/>
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin Bag<br/>
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens<br/>
600 drops, Mercedes Benz<br/>
The only time you wear Burberry to swim<br/>
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him<br/>
She do anything necessary for him<br/>
And I do anything necessary for her<br/>
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
(Talk to 'em B)<br/>
If I was your girlfriend<br/>
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you<br/>
Even if that sombody's me<br/>
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em)<br/>
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be<br/>
And so I put this on my life<br/>
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us<br/>
And I promise I'll give my life<br/>
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend<br/>
Put this on my life<br/>
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in<br/>
I promise I'll give my life<br/>
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
