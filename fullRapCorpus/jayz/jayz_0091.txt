Yeah, yeah..<br/>
Uhh, right, right, right<br/>
Right, right, right, right<br/>
<br/>
Uhh uhh uhh, feel me now, listen<br/>
Momma loved me, pop left me<br/>
Mickey fed me, and he dressed me<br/>
Eric fought me, made me tougher<br/>
Love you for that my nigga no matter what brah<br/>
Marcy raised me; and whether right or wrong<br/>
Streets gave me all I write in the song<br/>
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers<br/>
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up<br/>
East Trenton grew me, had me skippin school<br/>
Valencia's boyfriend Vovo had me makin moves<br/>
Momma raised me, pop I miss you<br/>
God help me forgive him I got some issues<br/>
Mickey cleaned my ears, and he shampooed my hair<br/>
Eric was fly - shit, I used to steal his gear<br/>
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong<br/>
Yeah it's goin past fast - let's move along<br/>
Kitchen table - that's where I honed my skills<br/>
Jaz made me believe the shit was real<br/>
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee<br/>
Clark sought me out, Dame believed<br/>
Primo laced me, Ski did too<br/>
"Reasonable Doubt" - classic, shoulda went triple<br/>
Momma loved me, pop left me<br/>
Grandma dressed me, plus she fed me<br/>
banana puddin, what's in the hood then<br/>
Puffin on L's, drinkin pink champelle<br/>
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot<br/>
Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggaz, V.A.'s locked<br/>
Vigs fucked with a nigga, whassup ha?<br/>
(?) high hated the fact I put rap to the back<br/>
Money pourin in, clientele growin now<br/>
Birth of my first nephew, time to slow it down<br/>
October 21st, Lavelle came to the world<br/>
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl<br/>
Momma loved me, T.T. Uncle Jay<br/>
loves you to death won't let no trouble come your way<br/>
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland<br/>
He's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?<br/>
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra<br/>
And your son too - there's nothin I won't do<br/>
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?<br/>
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me<br/>
Police pursued me, chased cuffed and subdued me<br/>
Talked to me rudely; cause I'm young rich and I'm black<br/>
and live in a movie, not livin by rules<br/>
New rap patrollin the city, follow my crews<br/>
Bleek you're still with me - nigga what did I say?<br/>
The time is comin; you one hit away<br/>
Beans I ain't tryin to change you - just give you some game<br/>
to make the transition, from the street to the fame<br/>
My momma loves me..
