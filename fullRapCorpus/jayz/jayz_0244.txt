<i>[hispanic voice same as "Intro" from "In My Lifetime, Vol. 1"]</i><br/>
What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker<br/>
You a punk<br/>
I been with MADE people.. CONNEC-TED people<br/>
Who you been wit? Chain snatchin, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers<br/>
Why don't you go get lost<br/>
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You're now tuned into the greatest<br/>
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us<br/>
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see em, try to be em<br/>
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder<br/>
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under<br/>
Face one up, to take over, the break's over<br/>
Nigga I'm the God MC, me, Jay-hovah<br/>
Shit knockin, almost a crime, get Cochran<br/>
Bangin to the hearse where my doctors hand<br/>
hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away<br/>
They wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride<br/>
if they try to plant, under the seat of my car<br/>
even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes<br/>
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper<br/>
Rep ya game pros<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wais]</i><br/>
We celebrate this, while you sittin back screamin you hate this<br/>
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix<br/>
Spittin sperm inside of latex<br/>
You get, no respect like a child rapist<br/>
Delegate this, men just givin facelifts<br/>
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus<br/>
nor Ceasar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases<br/>
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming<br/>
Who start shit? My style is laced with arsenic<br/>
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless<br/>
I know you wanna see me wasted<br/>
You call the order, I'll be in Hell<br/>
Team Roc sweater and ice water<br/>
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel<br/>
blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals<br/>
Y'all niggaz is local but that's evident<br/>
I'm Resident Evil, movin like ?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggaz runnin<br/>
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya<br/>
Point the Mac at ya, niggaz caught up<br/>
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture<br/>
like a compound fracture, can't fuck widdit<br/>
For the love of sex money and drugs<br/>
Affiliated with the sets Tecs honies and thugs<br/>
Let the four power, rain on niggaz like a spring shower<br/>
and bring flowers for the bodies that surround us<br/>
If you was lookin you found us<br/>
Movin with speed, tried to play Superman<br/>
ended up like Chris Reeves<br/>
Parapalegic, precise minds like the Pharoah's of Egypt<br/>
Shot through a barrel niggaz narrowly weaved it<br/>
Keepin my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's<br/>
bulgin out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded<br/>
Holdin, ? shots with you like a secret<br/>
It's like a story never told, but believe it...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sauce Money]</i><br/>
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker<br/>
Lick a round, niggaz hit the ground like Sanka<br/>
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways, Aim better<br/>
than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire<br/>
"Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes<br/>
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin<br/>
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin<br/>
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims<br/>
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin<br/>
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman<br/>
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny<br/>
Niggaz is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed<br/>
like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon<br/>
Heat-seekin, grill huntin, still frontin?<br/>
Keep squeezin, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing<br/>
No motherfuckers hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail<br/>
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Geyeah, there you have it<br/>
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever<br/>
Never disrespect this thing of ours<br/>
Roc-a-Fella family
