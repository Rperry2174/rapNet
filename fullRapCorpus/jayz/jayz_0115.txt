<i>[Intro/Chorus: Pharrell Williams]</i><br/>
You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)<br/>
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)<br/>
Why not? -- You should be comin home with me<br/>
Sittin in this lap with the luxury<br/>
Now you can, come in the mornin while wakin up (Yeah!)<br/>
Actin like you behave and stuff (Uh-huh!)<br/>
You should be comin home with me<br/>
Sittin in this lap with the luxury, now check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z + (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
Yes.. a lime to a lemon, my V-A women<br/>
walk in Manolo Blahniks cause my condo with elevators in 'em<br/>
She wanna wrinkle my linens<br/>
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin, uhh<br/>
Blasphemy, oh my God, we be sinnin<br/>
She keeps scratchin me like she tiger in 'em<br/>
This is exactly, why I had to pin her<br/>
to the bed like a wrestler, her to press on her, uhh<br/>
Her man kept pagin, stressin her<br/>
So I told her what to say just in case he question her<br/>
 (Situations.. will arise, but you gotta be smart about it)<br/>
No matter what you do, don't talk about us<br/>
Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it<br/>
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again<br/>
Bring a friend!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Guess who's back in my motherfuckin house<br/>
Half black, half white chick, I call her Minnie Mouse<br/>
.. We always hook up when we out<br/>
We do what we like to do and then we out<br/>
But lately I've been havin the strangest feelings<br/>
Your boy Young Hov' catchin feelings<br/>
and it's messin up my dealings cause mami's not willin<br/>
to leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend<br/>
Said, "We was just 'sposed to hook up and have a glass"<br/>
She called me her emergency dick-in-the-glass<br/>
Hehehe.. I had to laugh for a second<br/>
Had to check myself, get my mackin back in perspective<br/>
I slack for a second but I'm back, no question<br/>
Like I walk with a cane, ain't no half-steppin!<br/>
... Jeah, and on that note<br/>
Iceberg Slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[Ph.W.]</i> Yeah<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Let's have breakfast baby<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This is - if that kid don't get too suspicious<br/>
Stop blowin up your digits<br/>
Showin up livid, claimin he wanna fight<br/>
But Shawn all business with his type (uh-uh) naw!<br/>
Shawn just tryna keep the friendship tight<br/>
Shawn to Sean Paul 'em if you "Gimmie the Light"<br/>
And this way you can stay for life, aight?<br/>
..<br/>
