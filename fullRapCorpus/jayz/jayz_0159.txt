Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind<br/>
<br/>
Now can I get an encore, do you want more<br/>
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy<br/>
So for one last time I need y'all to roar<br/>
<br/>
Now what the hell are you waitin for<br/>
After me, there shall be no more<br/>
So for one last time, nigga make some noise<br/>
<br/>
Get em Jay<br/>
<br/>
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that<br/>
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at<br/>
Can't none of y'all mirror me back<br/>
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime<br/>
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead<br/>
Back to take over the globe, now break bread<br/>
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express<br/>
Out the country but the blueberry still connect<br/>
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck<br/>
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep<br/>
Grand openin, grand closin<br/>
God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again<br/>
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen<br/>
just draw off inspiration<br/>
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him<br/>
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS<br/>
<br/>
Now can I get an encore, do you want more<br/>
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy<br/>
So for one last time I need y'all to roar<br/>
<br/>
Now what the hell are you waitin for<br/>
After me, there shall be no more<br/>
So for one last time, nigga make some noise<br/>
<br/>
What the hell are you waiting for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[sighs]</i> Look what you made me do, look what I made for you<br/>
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you<br/>
When you first come in the game, they try to play you<br/>
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you<br/>
From Marcy to Madison Square<br/>
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)<br/>
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears<br/>
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye<br/>
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5<br/>
It ain't to play games witchu<br/>
It's to aim at you, probably maim you<br/>
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens<br/>
Cocksucker take one for your team<br/>
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)<br/>
I came, I saw, I conquered<br/>
From record sales, to sold out concerts<br/>
So muh'fucker if you want this encore<br/>
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br/>
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface<br/>
Don't know what you're expecting of me<br/>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br/>
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)<br/>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br/>
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)<br/>
And every second I waste is more than I can take<br/>
<br/>
I've become so numb I can't feel you there<br/>
I've become so tired so much more aware<br/>
I'm becoming this all I want to do<br/>
Is be more like me and be less like you<br/>
<br/>
I've become so numb<br/>
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...)<br/>
I've become so numb<br/>
So for one last time I need y'all to roar<br/>
One last time I need y'all to roar
