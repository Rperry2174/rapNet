Stress<br/>
Sunshine, geyeah<br/>
<br/>
I sold it all from crack to o-pium, in third person<br/>
I don't wanna see em, so I'm rehearsin<br/>
with my peoples high to GM, from a remote lo-cation<br/>
in the BM, scopin the whole situation like, "Dayamm!"<br/>
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cre-am<br/>
but one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean<br/>
It's difficult to read em, the windows to his soul<br/>
are half closed, I put the key in<br/>
Pulled off slow, hopin my people flee-in<br/>
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in<br/>
Coppers was watchin us through nighttime binoculars<br/>
This time they got us on tape, exchangin dope for dollars<br/>
Make me wanna, holler back at the crib in the sauna<br/>
Prayin my people bailed out like Time/Warner<br/>
Awaitin call, from his kin not the coroner<br/>
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner<br/>
Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind<br/>
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets<br/>
This time... stress... givin this shit up... fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
This is the number one rule for your set<br/>
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets<br/>
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget<br/>
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets<br/>
This is the number one rule for your set<br/>
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets<br/>
And through our travels we get seperated, never forget<br/>
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets<br/>
<br/>
As sure as this, Earth is turning souls burning<br/>
in search of higher learning turning in every direction seeking direction<br/>
My moms cryin cause her insides are dyin<br/>
her son tryin her patience, keep her heart racin<br/>
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit<br/>
but it's this game love, I'm caught up all in it<br/>
They make it so you can't prevent it, never give it<br/>
you gotta take it, can't fake it I keep it authentic<br/>
My hand got this pistol shakin, cause I sense danger<br/>
like Camp Crystal Lake and<br/>
don't wanna shoot him, but I got him, trapped<br/>
within this infrared dot, bout to hot him and, hit rock bottom<br/>
No answers to these trick questions, no time shit stressin<br/>
My life found I got ta live for the right now<br/>
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands<br/>
once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best<br/>
Anything in this world I want I could posess<br/>
All that made me want is all that I could get<br/>
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets... (when I was young)<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
I found myself reminiscin, remember this one<br/>
when he was here he was crazy nice with his son<br/>
I miss him, long as I'm livin he's livin through memories<br/>
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies<br/>
In heaven lookin over me, or in hell, keepin it cozy<br/>
I'm comin life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be<br/>
Remember Newton, mutual friend well me and him feudin<br/>
On your life I tried to talk to him<br/>
But you know niggaz, think they guns can stop foe niggaz<br/>
Frontin like they're, Big Willie but really old niggaz<br/>
Hoe niggaz, this year I'm sho' niggaz think I'm slippin<br/>
I'm bought to send you a roommate, no bullshittin<br/>
for my hustle's goin too well to hit him<br/>
You was right niggaz want you to be miserable wit em<br/>
Anyway, I ain't tryin to hear it, I think I'm touched<br/>
this whole verse I been talkin to your spirit, a little too much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Roc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A-Fella y'all
