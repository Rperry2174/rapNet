Uh-huh<br/>
Blackhand Ent.<br/>
Roc-a-Fella Records<br/>
In association with the streets<br/>
The Black Gangster<br/>
In conjunction<br/>
With everything official<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
I ride through the ghetto windows down halfway<br/>
Halfway out of my mind music on 9, blasting Donny Hathaway<br/>
Me and my niggas spending half the day<br/>
Plotting, how we gonna get this math with out getting blast away<br/>
I wake up to the same problems after today<br/>
Life is harsh, nigga got a right to spark<br/>
Right from the start they place me in the ghetto tender age of nine<br/>
I tend to mine and to surrender to crime<br/>
Wouldn't wish this on nobody like the end of like mine<br/>
Ever since i was quite young a nigga been in divine<br/>
Had to scratch for every plaque, rap ain't even all its cracked up to be<br/>
Niggas don't stack up to me<br/>
Had to hustle in a world of trouble<br/>
trapped in, claustrophobic the only way out was rapping<br/>
America don't understand it, the demographics i tapped in<br/>
I'm the truest nigga to do this nigga and anything else is foolish<br/>
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies<br/>
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives<br/>
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly<br/>
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down<br/>
Shit, i floss on my off-days fuck what they all say<br/>
Niggas can't stop me like rumors, I'm too strong<br/>
All-day<br/>
Socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging<br/>
Holding it down on the corner of my block, posin'<br/>
My spot is golden, drop the price on the coke and<br/>
Drove the competition out and let the dough flow in<br/>
The cops is closing in, i can do the time<br/>
But whats really on my mine, is there's no hoes in the pen<br/>
I play the low and try and make it hard to find me<br/>
Feds still tryna build a case since '93<br/>
I told them, I'm retired but they like whatever<br/>
You know them pigs don't wanna see you get your life together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm stuck in this life forever<br/>
The more things change the more they stay the same<br/>
Who am i to change the game?<br/>
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine<br/>
The blocks hotter than its ever been<br/>
<br/>
Once again<br/>
Hold the gun at eye level, i ain't afraid of conflict<br/>
I let the nine rip, nigga say "hi" to the devil<br/>
I blind with the bezel, I'm in line with the ghetto<br/>
What yall nigga afraid of my mind or the metal<br/>
Niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise<br/>
I carry the nine, so fucking with me just ain't the answer<br/>
I can't lose when i was young i was like Fresh<br/>
Poppa raised me to chess moves<br/>
And though your gone I'm not bitter you left me prepared<br/>
We got divided by the years, but i got it from here<br/>
Don't sweat that, sounds bump from Marcy to Lefrak<br/>
To that pocket in DC where my man caught his death at<br/>
Over my years I've seen Rooks get tooken by the Knight<br/>
Lose they Crown by tryna defend a Queen<br/>
Checkmate, in 4 moves the Bobby Fischer of rap<br/>
With raw moves in a time where we all move<br/>
Lets face it either your dough chasing, or basing<br/>
Lacing, cops got your face sprung like mason<br/>
Careful, any infiltration I'm leaving niggas<br/>
Leaving more than just information<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
Real shit<br/>
The Black Gangsta<br/>
Blackhand Ent.<br/>
Roc a Fella<br/>
Never interrupt this thing of ours<br/>
The Black Ganagsa<br/>
Jigga<br/>
Hova<br/>
Roll with me
