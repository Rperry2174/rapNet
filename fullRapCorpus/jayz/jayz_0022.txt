<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What, tssh, y'all, what<br/>
Jigga, uhh uhh uhh, uh-huh<br/>
Pa-pa, uhh, pa-pa, uhh<br/>
The G, Roc-A-Fella y'all<br/>
<br/>
Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi<br/>
Drinking saki, it's me, and my mami with the doobie<br/>
Cutie, smellin like Tiaka, half-Phillipine thing<br/>
For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty bangin<br/>
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance<br/>
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy<br/>
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ<br/>
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me<br/>
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early<br/>
Cause who's gettin played is not me<br/>
"Surely you jest," she said, "if you thought I was purely<br/>
out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"<br/>
I said maturely, "You right<br/>
but better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds<br/>
can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story<br/>
To make sure that you one of a kind<br/>
And you deserve to be my Sunshine"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Babyface (variations not listed except for first time)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)<br/>
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)<br/>
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)<br/>
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z, (Foxy Brown)]</i><br/>
A year gone, and she seein things most chicks only<br/>
hear in songs (uh-huh) keep in gear phenom<br/>
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)<br/>
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm<br/>
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)<br/>
just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Foxy Brown, (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
I ain't deaf nor blind, niggaz stressin<br/>
Hatin cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me<br/>
We chose each other, you actin like you chose me<br/>
They oppose you then, they oppose me<br/>
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery<br/>
Double cross you they got to triple cross me<br/>
(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh<br/>
(One more thing:<br/>
If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'<br/>
(She replied, eyes open wide) Uhhhh<br/>
(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life<br/>
(Right)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z, (Foxy Brown)]</i><br/>
If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo' sho')<br/>
Catch a case you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho')<br/>
Pawn your jewlery to come get me? (You better know)<br/>
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know)<br/>
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)<br/>
They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh)<br/>
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales<br/>
that you was, throwin rocks, at the Roof at 12, nigga?)<br/>
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail<br/>
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to La'Velle<br/>
Me and you ballin, from the heavens, or the hell<br/>
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin myself<br/>
Now picture me leavin you in this cold world, rollin for delf<br/>
It's me and you in this old girl, we takin the belt<br/>
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine<br/>
Just continue to be my Sunshine (uhhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
