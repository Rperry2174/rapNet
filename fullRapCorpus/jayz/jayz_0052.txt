<i>[Dre]</i> Watch me!<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> Jigga-Man, ya heard? Boom boom boom<br/>

<i>[Dre]</i> Compton!<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> Gotti Gotti ya heard? Yo..<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> C'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You gotta, pop that styles, rock that watch dial<br/>
See that Benz? Cop that now<br/>
Drop-that-top-down, they gon' kill us anyway<br/>
Them cops uptown hit holmes with forty-one rounds<br/>
Live yo' life, get yo' ice<br/>
She been with you since day one nigga, trick on yo' wife<br/>
Spend that dough, when in doubt, take that trip<br/>
She ain't livin for the moment homey shake that bitch<br/>
He that cool, he can't take you nowhere? Then leave that fool<br/>
Be that rude if he that cool<br/>
Save for what? Ball til your days is up<br/>
This place is fucked, all type of AIDS and such<br/>
How they make it where you afraid to fuck<br/>
They gave us drugs then turned around and investigated us<br/>
Life is short, then you on life support<br/>
so in between it all I'ma say I seen it all, watch me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)<br/>
and tell me you won't ball every chance you get (uhh, watch me)<br/>
At any, chance you hit (that's right) we live for the moment<br/>
(yo, watch, watch) Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars<br/>
(Watch me) You see me around some cheese<br/>
(Watch me) See me with hustlers around them G's<br/>
(Watch me) Blowin 'dro runnin through pounds of weed<br/>
(Watch me) At the bar baby, round's on me<br/>
(Watch me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Watch me turn somethin out of nothin, turn platinum from gold<br/>
Watch me light the Cohiba off the Viking stove<br/>
I take an empty bank account, fill it with oh's<br/>
I take an empty building then I fill it with hoes<br/>
Watch me, cop that Coupe, shine for the ladies<br/>
have em sayin, "Damn I never seen a watch that blue"<br/>
And while they still mesmerized I pop that cooch'<br/>
Shit, law enforcement couldn't stop that dude<br/>
Guess who? Fresh off of "Volume 2"<br/>
Back at you, peep the numbers my album do<br/>
They call me Cham-pagne-hovah, wake up with a hangover<br/>
When y'all think the game's over, do the same thing over<br/>
Still with the same soldiers<br/>
Still gettin brain and it's plain ain't a thang gon' change over<br/>
Hop out the truck, hand on my cock and nuts<br/>
Who got the bank, I'm stoppin it up, watch me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)<br/>
and tell me you won't ball every chance you get (watch me)<br/>
At any, chance you hit, we live for the moment<br/>
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars<br/>
(Watch me) You see me around some cheese<br/>
(Watch me) Hangin with hustlers around them G's<br/>
(Watch me) Blowin 'dro runnin through pounds of weed<br/>
(Watch me) At the bar bitch, round's on me<br/>
(Watch me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yo the watch too rocky, need shades<br/>
Continental sittin on blades, spinnin like waves<br/>
Gun too Brock-y, behave<br/>
Big shot, plus I'm feelin like Rocky these days<br/>
Ice don't melt I could ski through a heatwave<br/>
Nights won't help you see Jay, it'll be day<br/>
My shit too bright, I rip through mics<br/>
plus I push more powder than Crystal Light<br/>
Chick mad, said I hold my pistol too tight<br/>
Get a grip bitch, this how I get through life<br/>
I buy out the bar, spit Crist' through the mic<br/>
See Jigga in the 6 and all the shit you like<br/>
See Jigga givin dick to every bitch you like<br/>
I told her, "It's Jay-Day and Hit-You-Night"<br/>
You wanna, see me again you gotta get two dice<br/>
I got rules I can't hit you twice, you heard me?<br/>
Watch me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)<br/>
and tell me you won't ball every chance you get (that's right)<br/>
At any, chance you hit, we live for the moment<br/>
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars<br/>
(Watch me) You see me around some cheese<br/>
(Watch me) See me with hustlers around them G's<br/>
(Watch me) Blowin 'dro runnin through pounds of weed<br/>
(Watch me) At the bar baby, round's on me<br/>
(Watch me)<br/>
(Watch me) You see me around some cheese<br/>
(Watch me) Hangin with hustlers around them G's<br/>
(Watch me) Blowin 'dro runnin through pounds of weed<br/>
(Watch me) At the bar bitch, round's on me<br/>
(Watch me)<br/>
