<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I did it again niggaz<br/>
Fucked up, right? ha, I know<br/>
I know what y'all niggaz asking yourself<br/>
He gonna ever fall off?<br/>
No...<br/>
<br/>
...lot of speculation<br/>
on the monies I've made, honeys I've slayed<br/>
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?<br/>
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct<br/>
Is it true he slay the beef and slept with a tech?<br/>
What's the position you hold? Can you really match<br/>
a triple platinum artist buck by buck by only a single goin gold?<br/>
Roc-A-Fella ship fold, and you're left out in the cold<br/>
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O<br/>
For the millionth time askin me<br/>
Questions like Wendy Williams, harrassin me<br/>
then get upset when I catch feelings<br/>
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave<br/>
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinnin on my sleeve<br/>
Uggh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?<br/>
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?<br/>
What you doin in L.A., with phillipinos and ese's<br/>
Latinos and Cheve's, down by Pico withh Frederico<br/>
I answer all your questions but then y'all got to go<br/>
Now the question I ask you is how bad you want to know? BLAOW!<br/>
<br/>
uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh, How we do? What?<br/>
uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh, How we do?<br/>
<br/>
'98 Primo remix and ain't nothing different<br/>
I don't kow what the hell niggas been snifin'<br/>
Jiggas still dippin Chrome on the whips and<br/>
4 days out the week find me in the kitchen<br/>
Still in the game nigga, hooked like glue<br/>
Popie gave me one pie, but it cook like two<br/>
I'm a crook like you,<br/>
Cats around my way was buyin brand new whips and shit, what could I do?<br/>
Know when I'm supposed to style,<br/>
I'm the huster's poster child, Rock lizards and crock-a-dile<br/>
Live ironic and what-not<br/>
Put all that ice on the face of a watch just to make it hot<br/>
Now you see me on them stages<br/>
Rocks in the air lookin' like Blue Lasers, Never fool gazers<br/>
Act couragous, I smack 'em wit da two aces<br/>
Mack double one, nigga I'm troublesome<br/>
All I got for chicks hard dick and bubble gum<br/>
Flip bricks like Fred, Barney Rubble and thum<br/>
It's the Rock-A-Fella click, What's Fucked up wit' thum?<br/>
Not a damn thang nigga, we doin our damn thing.. BLAOW!!!<br/>
uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh, How we do? Come on....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Radio Announcer:]</i><br/>
Sounds so beautiful, Don't you agree ladies and gentlemen??<br/>
<i>[Music Changes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
HA! Well they call me Jay-hovah cause the flow is religious<br/>
Ever since I was 16 I been holding digits<br/>
I'm seeing this industry clearer<br/>
As if I had coke in the trunk and cops in the rear mirror<br/>
I slow flows all to death, So ya'll ho's know whos best, Jigga!!<br/>
The flow be ipendito, for the mama's I hable espanol nikito<br/>
O-et-te I got timing like a subway, now holla back ba-by<br/>
Uh-huh-huh Jay-Z, you motha fuckin right<br/>
in the darkest nights let off my gun for light<br/>
To guide ya'll through, show you how it's done<br/>
I'm the question and the answer like Iverson<br/>
Jets be private ones, no gate to lift<br/>
So when I take flight it's from Hanger 6<br/>
Bang wit this, Wake up wit one in your brain<br/>
and the cocaine flows straight, numbin your pain<br/>
This ain't your speed young man, run in your lane<br/>
So I can come through doin a hundred and change<br/>
I put one in your frame picture that, Who's runnin the game<br/>
Let's get to that I guess we one in the same, A Million and One<br/>
Once Again<br/>
Novacane flow, ho you ain't know<br/>
Like a balla in an Impalla Jigga remain Low<br/>
Then I pop up and tear your block up and kick off like soccer<br/>
In a range rove twist ho's like ankles, Till the next time Poppa<br/>
I hit ya'll with a million more
