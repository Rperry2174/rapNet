<i>[Intro - Rihanna]</i><br/>
Feel it comin' in the air<br/>
Hear the screams from everywhere<br/>
I'm addicted to the thrill<br/>
It's a dangerous love affair<br/>
Can't be scared when it goes down<br/>
Got a problem, tell me now<br/>
Only thing that's on my mind<br/>
Is who's gonna run this town tonight...<br/>
Is who's gonna run this town tonight...<br/>
We gonna run this town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We are<br/>
Yeah I said it<br/>
We are<br/>
This is Roc Nation<br/>
Pledge your allegiance<br/>
Get y'all black tees on<br/>
All black everything<br/>
Black cards, black cars<br/>
All black everything<br/>
And our girls are blackbirds<br/>
Ridin' with they dillingers<br/>
I'd get more in depth<br/>
If you boys really real enough<br/>
This is la familia<br/>
I'll explain later<br/>
But for now let me get back to this paper<br/>
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back<br/>
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks<br/>
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma<br/>
six zeros<br/>
dot zero<br/>
Here it go...<br/>
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas<br/>
Now we squared up<br/>
Hold up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rihanna]</i><br/>
Life's a game but it's not fair<br/>
I break the rules so I don't care<br/>
So I keep doin' my own thing<br/>
Walkin' tall against the rain<br/>
Victory's within the mile<br/>
Almost there, don't give up now<br/>
Only thing that's on my mind<br/>
Is who's gonna run this town tonight<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
(Is who's gonna run this town tonight)<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We are<br/>
Yeah I said it<br/>
We are<br/>
You can call me Cesar<br/>
In a dark Czar<br/>
Please follow the leader<br/>
So Eric B. we are<br/>
Microphone fiend<br/>
It's the return of the god<br/>
Peace god...<br/>
(Auh! Auh!)<br/>
And ain't nobody fresher<br/>
I'm in Mason<br/>
(Ah!)<br/>
Martin Margiela<br/>
On the tape we're screamin'<br/>
Fuck the other side, they jealous<br/>
We got a banquette full the broads<br/>
They got a table full of fellas... (?)<br/>
And they ain't spending no cake<br/>
They should throw they hand in<br/>
'Cause they ain't got no spades...<br/>
My whole team got dough<br/>
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaire's Row<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rihanna]</i><br/>
Life's a game but it's not fair<br/>
I break the rules so I don't care<br/>
So I keep doin' my own thing<br/>
Walkin' tall against the rain<br/>
Victory's within the mile<br/>
Almost there, don't give up now<br/>
Only thing that's on my mind<br/>
Is who's gonna run this town tonight<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
(Is who's gonna run this town tonight)<br/>
Hey-hey-hey-hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Kanye West]</i><br/>
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow<br/>
To everybody on your dick, no homo<br/>
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos<br/>
Next time I'm in church, please no photos<br/>
Police escorts<br/>
Everybody passports<br/>
This the life that everybody ask for<br/>
This a fast life<br/>
We are on a crash course<br/>
What you think I rap for<br/>
To push a fucking Rav 4?<br/>
But I know that if I stay stun-ting<br/>
All these girls only gonna want one thing<br/>
I could spend my whole life good will hunting<br/>
Only good gon' come is as good when I'm cumming<br/>
She got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string<br/>
And up top, unh...<br/>
Two bee stings<br/>
And I'm beasting<br/>
Off the riesling<br/>
And my nigga just made it out the precinct<br/>
We give a damn about the drama that you do bring<br/>
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring<br/>
Reebok<br/>
Baby<br/>
You need to drop some new things<br/>
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?<br/>
What's that 'Ye?<br/>
Baby, these heels<br/>
Is that a may?<br/>
What?!<br/>
Baby, these wheels<br/>
You trippin' when you ain't sippin'<br/>
Have a refill<br/>
You feelin' like you runnin', huh?<br/>
Now you know how we feel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Rihanna]</i><br/>
We gonna run this town tonight!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Wassup!
