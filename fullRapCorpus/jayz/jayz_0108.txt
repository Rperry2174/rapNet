Yes, yes YEP!<br/>
Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza<br/>
I'd like to introduce my band right now<br/>
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe<br/>
Right now I want you to give the drummer some<br/>
No ma really, give the drummer some<br/>
Uhh<br/>
<br/>
Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable<br/>
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)<br/>
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable<br/>
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Follow the flow, look<br/>
They say a midget standin on the giant's shoulder can see much<br/>
further than the giant.. (the giant..)<br/>
So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see<br/>
further than I am.. (than I am..)<br/>
And I have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation<br/>
with David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)<br/>
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course<br/>
and I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)<br/>
But bein tyrant, comin through your environment<br/>
Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back<br/>
With "The Team," no I in that<br/>
R.O.C., y'all not eyein that<br/>
Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone<br/>
"The Dynasty," no not Ming but Shawn's<br/>
Dame careems, nigga it's the gangsta team<br/>
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene<br/>
The other reason, we got a gang of green<br/>
If there's better at gettin cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga<br/>
<br/>
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Jeah, jeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable<br/>
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)<br/>
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable<br/>
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)<br/>
<br/>
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Jeah, look<br/>
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life<br/>
Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice<br/>
Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present<br/>
I'm fast, niggaz can't get past my past<br/>
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?<br/>
When I unwrap "The Gift &amp; the Curse" in one session<br/>
Ain't no livin person can test him<br/>
Only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him<br/>
Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it<br/>
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it<br/>
If you did it I done it before, you get I had it<br/>
Got mad at it and don't want it no more<br/>
And that goes for everything from flippin that raw<br/>
Flippin whores, flippin vocal chords, don't get it twisted<br/>
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice<br/>
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yup!  Hovi's home, the global phone<br/>
The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back<br/>
You cats overfelt yourself<br/>
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel<br/>
In my absence cats get, absent-minded<br/>
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em<br/>
why I'm in the position that I am<br/>
changin the game, my game could nail Madonna<br/>
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor<br/>
history in the makin, Pistol Pete<br/>
leave competition shakin without missin the beat<br/>
Chasin the hi-hat all over the track<br/>
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!<br/>
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget<br/>
The watch face so blue like it's holdin it's breath<br/>
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check<br/>
It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck<br/>
Live and correct I will bring it to your set<br/>
I got now, I don't care who got next<br/>
Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart<br/>
Your flow all y'all usin is mine, you're all useless<br/>
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin?<br/>
You all are faggots, you takin it backwards (takin it backwards)<br/>
I'm tryin to progress with this rap shit<br/>
Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident<br/>
Who was gassin 'em?  (Fuck outta here!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
