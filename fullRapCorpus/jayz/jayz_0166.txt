Uh, uh, uh, uh<br/>
It's not a dis song, it's just a real song<br/>
Feel me?<br/>
<br/>
I heard motherfuckers saying they made Hov<br/>
Made Hov say, "OK so, make another Hov"<br/>
Niggaz wasn't playing they day role<br/>
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo<br/>
I should've been did it but I been in a daze though<br/>
I put friends over business end of the day though<br/>
But when friends, business interests as they go<br/>
Ain't nothing left to say though<br/>
I guess we forgot what we came fo'<br/>
Should've stayed in food and beverage<br/>
Too much flossing<br/>
Too much Sam Rothstein<br/>
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them<br/>
Hov have to get the shallow shit up off him<br/>
And I ain't even want to be famous<br/>
Niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes<br/>
And I ain't even know how it came to this<br/>
Except that fame is<br/>
The worst drug known to man<br/>
It's stronger than, heroin<br/>
When you could look in the mirror like, "There I am"<br/>
And still not see, what you've become<br/>
I know I'm guilty of it too but, not like them<br/>
You lost one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ Marsha (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Lose one, let go to get one<br/>
Left one, lose some to win some (You lost one)<br/>
Story of a champion, sorry I'm a champion<br/>
You lost one<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it's meant to be, be<br/>
But she loves her work more than she does me<br/>
And honestly, at twenty-three<br/>
I would probably love my work more than I did she<br/>
So we, ain't we<br/>
It's me, and her<br/>
'Cause what she prefers over me, is work<br/>
And that's, where we, differ<br/>
So I have to give her<br/>
Free, time, even if it hurts<br/>
So breathe, mami, it's deserved<br/>
You've been put on this earth to be<br/>
All you can be, like the reserves<br/>
And me? My time in the army, it's served<br/>
So I have to allow she, her, time to serve<br/>
The time's now for her<br/>
In time she'll mature<br/>
And maybe we, can be, we, again like we were<br/>
Finally, my time's too short to share<br/>
And to ask her now, it ain't fair<br/>
So yeah, she lost one<br/>
<br/>
Lose one, let go to get one<br/>
Left one, lose some to win some (Oh yeah, she lost one)<br/>
Story of a champion, sorry I'm a champion<br/>
You lost one<br/>
<br/>
My nephew died in the car I bought<br/>
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault<br/>
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought<br/>
Place any burden on me, but please, not that lord<br/>
Time don't go back, it go forward<br/>
Can't run from the pain, go towards it<br/>
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?<br/>
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit<br/>
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it<br/>
'til that time, little man I'm nauseous<br/>
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift<br/>
Almost lost my faith, that restored it<br/>
It's like having your life restarted<br/>
Can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it<br/>
So now I'm child-like, waiting for a gift<br/>
To return, when I lost you, I lost it<br/>
<br/>
Lose one, let go to get one<br/>
Left one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)<br/>
Sorry I'm a champion, Colleek, you're a champion<br/>
You lost one
