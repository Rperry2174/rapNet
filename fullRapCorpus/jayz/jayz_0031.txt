<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Come on...life...death...here...gone...Yo<br/>
<br/>
If I should die don't cry my niggas<br/>
just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas<br/>
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas<br/>
get on my niggas when it's real<br/>
say word to Shawn my niggas<br/>
If I should die <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
Don't cry my niggas it's been one hell of a ride my niggas<br/>
in the middle of the trial I flip pies my niggas<br/>
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas<br/>
I've eluded the coppers got booted with Big Poppa<br/>
Skated through with the Ceasar Picadas<br/>
At high school got head by the lockers<br/>
gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers<br/>
rocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail<br/>
rhymes still written well hold court in the street<br/>
never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail<br/>
shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck<br/>
sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me<br/>
everybody around us become one for that day<br/>
to live life get your shit right &amp; play<br/>
Don't get it twisted like rays if I miss that's ok<br/>
but life's short don't miss a day uhh<br/>
<br/>
If I should die don't cry my niggas<br/>
just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas<br/>
and when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas<br/>
get on my niggas when it's real<br/>
say word to Shawn my niggas<br/>
If I should die...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wais]</i><br/>
...don't cry my niggas<br/>
it's been one hell of a ride my niggas<br/>
say word to Wais my niggas<br/>
when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas<br/>
just keep gettin' it on my niggas<br/>
say word is bond my niggas<br/>
<br/>
I got a lot to look back on in '88<br/>
got my crack on ten years later gettin' my rap on<br/>
gettin' shorties like a thespian<br/>
had an episode with two lesbians got a fetish for that<br/>
drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks &amp; pulled the root out<br/>
squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts<br/>
been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat<br/>
probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets<br/>
I got dead mens to meet and questions to fulfill<br/>
like is that mystery God real?<br/>
and how was Kennedy killed? I ain't mad<br/>
I must've smoked a ton of reefer sipped Coronas<br/>
with Latifah broke the code of Geneva<br/>
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the<br/>
cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker<br/>
then it's on again if I could be born again<br/>
I live my life through my son<br/>
and tell him never have a friend<br/>
just family reincarnated I'll show him the time<br/>
that I waited to get paid tell him never be afraid<br/>
niggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo blood run thicker<br/>
never shed tears cry liquor my nigga<br/>
<br/>
If I die don't cry my niggas<br/>
it's been one hell of a ride my niggas<br/>
say word to Wais my niggas<br/>
when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas<br/>
just keep bangin' these songs my niggas<br/>
say word is bond my niggas<br/>
If I die...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Half Dead]</i><br/>
...don't cry my niggas<br/>
just stay gettin' high my niggas<br/>
don't wonder why my niggas<br/>
when I'm gone live on my niggas<br/>
just follow my path my niggas<br/>
say word to Half my nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone<br/>
born to live forever through life's struggles<br/>
I cut corners &amp; took drastic measures<br/>
see you niggas life expire right in front of me<br/>
time could never mend what these cold streets<br/>
mentally done to me too often I close my eyes<br/>
and see my own coffin feelin' haunted ready to leave<br/>
this world that I'm lost in my only chance<br/>
to see the seeds I lost through abortion<br/>
when I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn<br/>
keep flossin' as long as my name<br/>
lives on what's most important<br/>
I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life<br/>
afterlife still torchin' &amp; blazin' these mics<br/>
It'd rain for 40 days &amp; 40 nights<br/>
&amp; I'd return on the 3rd like Christ<br/>
without my physical portion<br/>
my spirit a poltergeist for sure<br/>
I'll be back through the heist tomorrow<br/>
blood over y'all fake niggas door<br/>
What you thought? (huh) <br/>
What you thought? (nigga)<br/>
<br/>
If I should die don't cry my niggas<br/>
just stay gettin' high my niggas<br/>
don't wonder why my niggas<br/>
when I'm gone live on my niggas<br/>
just follow my path my niggas<br/>
say word to Half my nigga<br/>
When I die...
