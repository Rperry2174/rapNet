<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Mmm, you don't understand now be..cause you're cryin, and you hurt<br/>
You'll understand soon enough.. soon enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singer overlaps Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Let him hold you, let him touch you<br/>
Soon you'll un-der-stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all<br/>
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all<br/>
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small<br/>
Shit I watched you mature - nah, this ain't right<br/>
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried<br/>
Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes<br/>
Take your time when you likin a guy<br/>
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die<br/>
I bought you earrings on your birthday<br/>
Drove you to college your first day<br/>
It must be sad, though it hurts to say<br/>
We could never be a item, don't even like him<br/>
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me<br/>
There's better guys out there other than me<br/>
(You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know)<br/>
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D<br/>
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be<br/>
if they found that you was huggin me<br/>
My conscience is fuckin with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singer]</i><br/>
Let him hold you, let him touch you<br/>
Soon you'll un-der-stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Man, I look in the eyes of a..<br/>
this.. a kid that stole life and me together..<br/>
We're tryin, really tryin to make it work<br/>
I'm young, and I ain't ready, and I told you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singer overlaps Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Let him hold you, let him touch you<br/>
Soon you'll un-der-stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It ain't like, I ain't tell you from day one, I ain't shit<br/>
When it comes to relationships, I don't have the patience<br/>
Now it's too late, we got a little life together<br/>
and in my mind I really want you to be my wife forever<br/>
But in the physical it's like I'ma be trife forever<br/>
A different girl every night forever; told you to leave<br/>
but you're stubborn and you love him and,<br/>
no matter what despite all the fuckin and the cheatin,<br/>
you still won't leave him, now you're grievin<br/>
And I feel bad, believe me<br/>
But I'm young and I ain't ready, and this ain't easy<br/>
Wasn't fair to tell you to wait, so I told you to skate<br/>
You chose not to, now look at the shit we gotta go through<br/>
Doin a fight, throw in a fuss, you the mother of my baby<br/>
I don't want you to hate me, this is about us<br/>
Rather me; I ain't ready to be what you want me to be<br/>
Because I love you, I want you to leave, please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singer]</i><br/>
Let him hold you, let him touch you<br/>
Soon you'll un-der-stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Mm... listen ma<br/>
I mean, I seen you workin two or three jobs<br/>
Daddy left... I I thought I was makin things better<br/>
I made it worse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singer overlaps Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Let him hold you, let him touch you<br/>
Soon you'll un-der-stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Dear ma, I'm in the cell, lonely as hell<br/>
Writin this scribe, thinkin bout how you must feel inside<br/>
You tried to teach me better, but I refused to grow<br/>
God damn I ain't the young man that you used to know<br/>
You said the street claim lives, but I wanted things like<br/>
bling bling ice I was wrong in hindsight<br/>
Shit we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse<br/>
I know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out<br/>
But your house is your house, I ain't respect the rules<br/>
I brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews<br/>
And who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs<br/>
Co-workers saw me on the corner slingin Larry Love<br/>
Meanwhile, you workin hard like, two or three jobs<br/>
Tryin to feed me and my siblings, makin an honest livin<br/>
Who am I kiddin I, call myself easin the load<br/>
I made the load heavy, I need money for commissary<br/>
Try to understand, please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singer - repeat all 6X until fade]</i><br/>
Let him hold you, let him touch you<br/>
Soon you'll un-der-stand
