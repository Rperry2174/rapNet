<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Ay yo I got a resolution<br/>
This year I'm playing right<br/>
No six fifteen this year<br/>
You can stay the night<br/>
We can go bowling it ain't like before<br/>
Can't y'all see that I'm growing?<br/>
I was so immature<br/>
I was young and having money<br/>
Having honeys come to the crib<br/>
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me<br/>
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge<br/>
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'<br/>
No room service just snacks and shit<br/>
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready<br/>
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash<br/>
Let 'em lean on the cash<br/>
Will take 'em on long trips<br/>
Break 'em with long dick<br/>
There was no such thing as strong relationships<br/>
But I'm off that playa shit<br/>
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi<br/>
That still can buy weed<br/>
And can give me some good head<br/>
And I'll make her remind me, uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z (Amil)]</i><br/>

<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo the only thing Bleek spinning is<br/>
Them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims<br/>
Home suspended from school again<br/>
I'm grown, still ill ladies love to be a deal, like Bleek<br/>
Can I feel up on your wood and grill?<br/>
It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain<br/>
She give me good brain<br/>
Love the way I push my slang<br/>
Callin' my jack soon as the hop in my V<br/>
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave<br/>
Bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this<br/>
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this<br/>
And I'm from Marcy you catch me on anybody's block<br/>
Rappin' thug, the Roc<br/>
Hoes they all clock like<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I was the worse<br/>
I used to switch chicks every day<br/>
Had niggas mad for real like "I wish he was gay"<br/>
Cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay<br/>
Just a matter of time she was gettin' with Jay<br/>
I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sippin' on 'zae<br/>
Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade<br/>
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today<br/>
You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away<br/>
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space<br/>
She said she feel free when she's around me<br/>
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me<br/>
She on the phone with her friends like how cool is she<br/>
