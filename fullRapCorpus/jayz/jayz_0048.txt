<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Can't stop it nigga, uh<br/>
Mm-hmm, uh-huh, can't stop that<br/>
Timbaland uh-huh.. Jigga Man uh-huh<br/>
Yeah.. Brook, Brook-Brooklyn huh?<br/>
That's right<br/>
Put your motherfuckin hands together, uh-huh<br/>
Put your motherfuckin hands together<br/>
Yo, can't stop it<br/>
<br/>
Yo..<br/>
Yo show closer, J-to-the-A-Y-Hovah<br/>
Place shutter down, who the fuck'll fuck around?<br/>
Game spitter, Range sitter, Bentley driver nigga<br/>
Keep a full clip I have to empty out on niggaz<br/>
Hoe bagger, no slacker, get this shit jumpin<br/>
like eight blacks, fo' crackers, get yo' ass jumped<br/>
Crist' sipper, six dipper, wrist glitter nigga<br/>
Gat buster, ass toucher.. clit licker<br/>
Go against Jigga yo' ass is dense<br/>
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cents?<br/>
Hot shit, kick a nigga, turn these mics out<br/>
My jewelry so bright you can turn these lights out<br/>
Hovah's like Noah keep two in the truck<br/>
I'm like U-Haul; every bitch move when I fuck<br/>
You move slut, I gotta put two in your butt<br/>
I'm everything: the when's, why's, who's, and what<br/>
Nigga what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (repeat 2X w/ minor variations)]</i><br/>
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot<br/>
My grind, keep me jumpin out of drop to drop<br/>
My shine, lose your sight tryin to watch the watch<br/>
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Seperate myself from the lame, no you can't see me<br/>
I'm 6-0-0, you 300 C-E<br/>
Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee<br/>
Hits in a row like MJ; "Hee-hee!"<br/>
Since I was waist height, late night, bustin in the clouds<br/>
Runnin wild, comin home late, cussin out my mouth<br/>
Niggaz said, "Bryan leave your cousin in the house"<br/>
Everytime we play the Dozen, he's buggin out<br/>
While y'all was playin yo-yo, I was sittin on low pros<br/>
Dippin the po-po, gettin that dough-dough<br/>
No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid<br/>
What's in the bank? Shoot it<br/>
Lose it like I ain't do it<br/>
You wanna play Jigga nigga what you drank fluid?<br/>
Got a full tank now you wanna pull rank?<br/>
I clap still, act ill, Jigga shoot thee<br/>
Give you chest pains, leg sprains absolutely<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Thirty-eight revolve like the sun round the Earth<br/>
Try to play hard get you found round the dirt<br/>
Six shell casings found round your shirt<br/>
<i>[cyring]</i> in surround sound from the hearse<br/>
Jigga Man, trigger man, hit your man up<br/>
Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up<br/>
Kidnap grown folks get them grands up<br/>
Timbaland, hot shit, get them hands up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
