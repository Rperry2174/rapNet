<i>[1st Verse:]</i><br/>
Sweet!<br/>
And still there's pain<br/>
If I would have grew up to be a doctor, my nephew would have grew up to do the same<br/>
But since I grew up through the game, and my influence is the same<br/>
And my therapy is music, they ask if you ashamed<br/>
And though I wish I could separate, two things, <br/>
I cannot, so my answer to you remains<br/>
I can walk down the hall or mirrors, in Versailles<br/>
And be so satisfied when I look a myself in the eyes<br/>
No shame, no sir, just big boats and tearing the coast up<br/>
Tight coup like I'm wearing the roadster,<br/>
For any coup I'm bear hugging the holster.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hov, alright, alright<br/>
And that may not be<br/>
What you call perfect<br/>
But, but it's my life<br/>
The life, the life, the life<br/>
Once again it's the life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse:]</i><br/>
So I make no apologies<br/>
Crooked policies <br/>
So a G a nigga gotta be<br/>
We playing for property, no monopoly<br/>
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me<br/>
They say the child shall lead, <br/>
So I take it far as I can, and then we shall see<br/>
Shall we dance with the devil, for a beat<br/>
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet<br/>
Do the hustle, put keys in the street<br/>
Then I'm ballroom dancing, ke-ke'ing in the suite<br/>
Sweet.  <br/>
BB's on the feet, TV's in the seat <br/>
Enemies on the creep<br/>
It's so corrupt<br/>
Soak it up<br/>
It's a lesson, never fuck up<br/>
One day you're up, next day you're down<br/>
Long as you stay the same, it will come back around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse:]</i><br/>
I'm even better, I'm eating better<br/>
Best thing about it is, my niggas eating together<br/>
With each endeavor<br/>
We reaching levels, niggas ain't seen in like forever<br/>
I'm hyman roth I make all my partners rich<br/>
I can vouch for you, if you ain't a part of this<br/>
So pardon me as I pave my wrist<br/>
As I parlay my chips, Hov!<br/>
Alright, alright, American Gangster, ganster, business like I'm white<br/>
But I'm not, I'm just bright<br/>
So fly with no fear of the flight<br/>
So if y'all hear my plight<br/>
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight<br/>
Couple mistakes here and there, not always right<br/>
But I'm always real, that's how I sleep at night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
