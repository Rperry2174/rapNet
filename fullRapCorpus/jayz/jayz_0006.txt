<i>[people clapping]</i><br/>
Yo whassup everybody this is Mariah Davis, Mad Wednesday's<br/>
we here tonight to have a good time ("Yo! Start the show! Start the show!")<br/>
Wait a minute; I see my man over there Jay-Z<br/>
Jay-Z, Dam Deass let me hear that lil' tape of yours, and it's fat<br/>
Why don't you come up here and kick a lil' freestyle<br/>
Put that champagne down, and kick a lil' freestyle for me tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) <i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
Y'all motherfuckers musta hear that Tribe Called Quest, let's do it again<br/>
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) <i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
Well I'm gone... check this out<br/>
Too much West coast dick-lickin, and too many niggaz on a mission<br/>
Doin your best Jay-Z rendition<br/>
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions<br/>
that you're just a fish in a pool of sharks nigga, listen<br/>
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a hoe<br/>
I'ma call you a hoe, too many bitches are shady<br/>
Too many ladies give these niggaz too many chances<br/>
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is<br/>
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances<br/>
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers<br/>
I been around this block, too many times<br/>
Rocked, too many rhymes, cocked, too many nines, too<br/>
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together<br/>
Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever<br/>
I don't follow any guidelines cause too many niggaz ride mine<br/>
so I change styles every two rhymes, hah, what the fuck<br/>
That's 22 too's for y'all motherfuckers out there, yaknahmean?<br/>
Shall I continue? Check it out, what?<br/>
<br/>
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!) <i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
Well I'm gone... yo, yo, yo<br/>
Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya<br/>
Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up<br/>
Too many faggot niggaz, clockin my spendin<br/>
Exercisin you're, gay like minds like Richard Simmons<br/>
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night<br/>
without the eight right, maybe you could test my weight, right<br/>
I dip, speak quicker than you ever seen<br/>
adminster pain, next the minister's screamin your name<br/>
At your wake as I peak in, look in your casket<br/>
feelin sarcastic, "Look at him, still sleepin"<br/>
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty<br/>
Mines thinkin longevity until I'm seventy<br/>
Livin heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?<br/>
Nigga ya broke, what the fuck you gon' tell me?<br/>
<br/>
("Oooooooooooh!")<br/>
<br/>
Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a fat track (aight)<br/>
Now this is comin on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in ninety-six<br/>
(no doubt no doubt) well, it is definitely the bomb<br/>
But you know I do wanna say somethin to you, I know<br/>
you've been havin a lot of problems with the law<br/>
But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%<br/>
Mad Wednesday's, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dang Dash<br/>
Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back anytime<br/>
(Hah, thanks a lot)<br/>
Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute<br/>
Ace, turn that music down<br/>
I smell some reefer, now you see?<br/>
That's why, our people don't have anything<br/>
Because we don't know how to go in places and act properly<br/>
("Hey shut the fuck up!")<br/>
Wait a minute wait a minute who told me shut the eff up?<br/>
Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here<br/>
I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out<br/>
Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech<br/>
Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin<br/>
We gotta build our own business, we gotta get our own<br/>
record companies goin like Roc-A-Fella Records...
