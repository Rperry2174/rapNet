Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant<br/>
The livest one representing BK to the fullest<br/>
Bastards duckin' when Hov be buckin'<br/>
Chicken-heads be cluckin'<br/>
<br/>
Back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen<br/>
And Jam Master Jay was alive I was mixin'<br/>
Cookin' coke in the kitchen<br/>
Back when Rodman was a Piston<br/>
Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one<br/>
Gave birth to my verbal imagination<br/>
Assume a virtue if you have not<br/>
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet<br/>
"Lord, we know who we are<br/>
Yet we know not what we may be"<br/>
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy<br/>
I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand<br/>
Back when Pam was on Martin<br/>
Yeah, that's where it all started<br/>
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a... nine millimeter<br/>
When Slick Rick made "Mona Lisa"<br/>
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all<br/>
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah<br/>
Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts<br/>
There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort<br/>
Marcy me<br/>
<br/>
Marcy me<br/>
Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence<br/>
I'm the Gotham City heartbeat<br/>
I started in lobbies now, parley with Saudis<br/>
Sufi to the goofies, I could probably speak Farsi<br/>
That's poetry, read a coca leaf from my past<br/>
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses<br/>
I need a trophy just for that<br/>
Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shift feel like a spoof<br/>
Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof<br/>
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke<br/>
Y'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope<br/>
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals<br/>
Plural fuck the Federal Bureau<br/>
Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle<br/>
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile<br/>
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes<br/>
Thus concludin' my concerto; Marcy me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The-Dream:]</i><br/>
Must be in the air<br/>
Oh, can't walk away, I know, I know<br/>
Just the way I was raised<br/>
I know, I know, I know<br/>
Oh Marcy, Marcy me<br/>
Just the way I am always gonna be<br/>
I ain't gonna change, no<br/>
Marcy, Marcy me, just the way I am<br/>
(Como hás nome, cavaleiro?<br/>
Eu hei nome Todo o Mundo<br/>
E meu tempo...)
