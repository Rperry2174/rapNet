<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Can I kick it?<br/>
Yes you can<br/>
Can I kick it?<br/>
Yes you can<br/>
Can I kick it?<br/>
Yes you can<br/>
<br/>
(I'm kina lovin that)<br/>
<br/>
Can I kick it?<br/>
Yes you can<br/>
Can I kick it?<br/>
Yes you can<br/>
Can I kick it?<br/>
Yes you can<br/>
<br/>
Rocafella forever Hov for life<br/>
Debuts a classical first album four mics<br/>
Shoulda gotta five but niggas lack full sight<br/>
But I don't giva fuck I aint do it for the hype<br/>
I do it for the hustlas for the ghetto for the polites<br/>
For the struggle for those who bubble white<br/>
Who fly four by four roofless cars flawless ice<br/>
For the pain for yall to know what its like<br/>
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights<br/>
For every promise made that never saw the light<br/>
I get my own forty acres give me four nights<br/>
Four o's a glock forty for the jackets and I'm right<br/>
All the four four was suffice<br/>
A fourteen year old will look out for the vice<br/>
You can sit back and just wait for the flight<br/>
Boy will take off like I've been strippin all my life<br/>
That's the type of metaphor so right<br/>
That let niggas know I was real before the mic<br/>
Four front rows had the fur at the fight<br/>
No pita on my pita left some room for the divas<br/>
And the sweet will meet up if you out for the night<br/>
On the rampage champaign pours on the floor<br/>
For all those who aint make it here and loss a life<br/>
Wouldn't forget yall for any price<br/>
Not for no hoes not for no ice<br/>
Not for no fame nor for bright lights<br/>
So I'ma end this here real mean but right<br/>
Fourty Four Fours motha fucka I'm NICE
