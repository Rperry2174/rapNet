<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I just want a Picasso, in my casa<br/>
No, my castle<br/>
I'm a hassa, no I'm an asshole<br/>
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle<br/>
I wanna Rothko, no I wanna brothel<br/>
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute<br/>
Let's make love on a million, in a dirty hotel<br/>
With the fan on the ceiling, all for the love of drug dealing<br/>
Marble Floors, gold Ceilings<br/>
Oh what a feeling - fuck it I want a billion<br/>
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up<br/>
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of<br/>
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA<br/>
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Oh what a feeling<br/>
Picasso Baby, Ca Picasso baby<br/>
Ca ca ca Picasso Baby, Ca ca ca Picasso baby<br/>
Oh what a feeling <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It ain't hard to tell<br/>
I'm the new Jean Michel<br/>
Surrounded by Warhols<br/>
My whole team ball<br/>
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel<br/>
I just wanna live life colossal<br/>
Leonardo Da Vinci flows<br/>
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes<br/>
See me thrown at the Met<br/>
Vogue'ing on these niggas<br/>
Champagne on my breath, Yes<br/>
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern<br/>
Because I be going ape at the auction<br/>
Oh what a feeling<br/>
Aw fuck it I want a trillion<br/>
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa<br/>
The modern day version<br/>
With better features<br/>
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner<br/>
Go ahead lean on that shit Blue<br/>
You own it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[break]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but<br/>
Damned if I didn't open Pandora's box<br/>
They try to slander your man<br/>
On CNN and Fox<br/>
My Miranda don't stand a chance, with cops<br/>
Even my old fans like old man just stop<br/>
I could if I would but I can't<br/>
I'm hot, and you blow<br/>
I'm still the man to watch, Hublot<br/>
On my left hand or not<br/>
Soon I step out the booth<br/>
The cameras pops niggas is cool with it<br/>
Till the canons pop<br/>
Now my hand on the bible<br/>
On the stand got your man in a jam, again<br/>
Got my hands in cuffs<br/>
I'm like god damn enough<br/>
I put down the cans and they ran amok<br/>
My hairpin<br/>
Piece skin rupture spleens<br/>
Cracks rips go through cribs and other things<br/>
No sympathy for the king huh<br/>
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy<br/>
Eventually the pendulum swings<br/>
Don't forget America this how you made me<br/>
Come through with 'Ye mask on<br/>
Spray everything like SAMO<br/>
Though I won't scratch the Lambo<br/>
What's it gonna to take<br/>
For me to go<br/>
For y'all to see<br/>
I'm the modern day Pablo<br/>
Picasso baby<br/>
<br/>
