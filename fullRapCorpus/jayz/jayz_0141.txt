Uhh, this feel right right here Quik<br/>
It's like it's 'sposed to happen this one right here<br/>
Young!  God damn..<br/>
.. let me justify my thug on this one right here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock rock<br/>
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock<br/>
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, the party bout to pop<br/>
Then - Roc-A-Fella y'all, it's your boy S. Dot<br/>
And I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga<br/>
to do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself<br/>
I will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell<br/>
I ain't never ran, never will<br/>
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands<br/>
to himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt<br/>
I never asked for nothin I don't demand of myself<br/>
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth<br/>
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else<br/>
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help<br/>
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years<br/>
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself<br/>
I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt<br/>
before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail<br/>
But I never sat back feelin sorry for myself<br/>
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell<br/>
'Til it's heaven<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - imitating Madonna]</i><br/>
Justify my thug!<br/>
"For you!" - <i>[Run-D.M.C.]</i><br/>
My thug.. (hoping..)<br/>
My thug.. (praying..) for you<br/>
to justify my thug!<br/>
My thug.. (hoping..)<br/>
My thug.. (praying..) for you..<br/>
"For you! Fresh" - <i>[Run-D.M.C.]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Now if you shoot my dog, I'ma kill yo' cat<br/>
Just the unwritten laws in rap - know dat<br/>
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin<br/>
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine<br/>
Don't be actin like you can't see street action<br/>
Take me back to +Reasonable Doubt+ time<br/>
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin the wreck<br/>
I put my muh'fuckin faith in the tec, tell Satan not yet<br/>
You understand I am chasin my breath<br/>
I am narrowly escapin my death, oh yes<br/>
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster<br/>
Travellin Mach 5, barrelin, my power can stop God<br/>
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you<br/>
Until, I won this race, then eventually<br/>
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me<br/>
However it turns out fine - red line!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight<br/>
And two wrongs don't make a right<br/>
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life<br/>
At what point does one fight?  (Good question right!)<br/>
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in it<br/>
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half<br/>
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs<br/>
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag<br/>
When your options is none and the pen is all you have<br/>
or the block, niggaz standin tight, there's limits on the ave<br/>
Tryin to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash<br/>
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast<br/>
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence<br/>
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us<br/>
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up<br/>
Every other corner there's a liquor store - fuck is up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
