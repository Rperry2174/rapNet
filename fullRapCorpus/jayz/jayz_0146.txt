<i>[Chorus (R. Kelly):]</i><br/>
Big chips! (Woo!) We off in Vegas drinking and partying<br/>
We got chicks in swimsuits modeling<br/>
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low<br/>
The way the wrist shine it's so magical<br/>
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)<br/>
Nigga what you heard it's Kells and Hov<br/>
With the second coming of Best Of Both<br/>
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z (R. Kelly)]</i><br/>
Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga<br/>
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)<br/>
Any day they could dig your grave<br/>
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig<br/>
No reward that's the risk is taken<br/>
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places<br/>
I on the other hand relish the situation<br/>
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious<br/>
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet<br/>
I overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it<br/>
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it<br/>
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this<br/>
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave us life for some shit like this<br/>
Ma you rolling I'm as real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Big chips! I can't take this<br/>
The way you move your ass slow like Matrix<br/>
You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas<br/>
Before I toss chips first, get naked<br/>
I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it<br/>
Superstar honey, so mean and vicious<br/>
Got a lot and coming, I'm so mean and vicious<br/>
Bark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!)<br/>
So go low mama, give it a go<br/>
As I punch 170 on stretch roads, must turn up the radio!<br/>
Girl you so good I'm swerving like whoa! whoa!<br/>
Uh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch<br/>
Out the stretch to the Hotel, into the hotel suite!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Big chips! I'm a boss I said<br/>
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs<br/>
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread<br/>
And the pigeons start flocking, balling like Bishop Loughlin<br/>
And stick Cochran on any DA, to try to stop him<br/>
So any gunplay that is an option<br/>
I been doing this since niggas was woppin<br/>
Rocking Izods with the matching socks, and<br/>
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching<br/>
Try to get real, you had to drop 'em<br/>
See I ain't never been a fronter<br/>
Or fake it till I make it tight nigga ma I don't want you number<br/>
Either you're coming or I one you<br/>
Either you know what you want ma, I don't even want you<br/>
You play pretty if you wanna<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
All around the world, stop where the sun sets<br/>
Spending big chips you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)<br/>
You wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)<br/>
Say we goin around the world, stop where the sun sets<br/>
Spending big chips you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)<br/>
Do you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Uh, come on, Tone, I see you, Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Track Masters<br/>
What's really good, we're in the islands chilling in the shade and shit you know<br/>
Blue waters, yellow sand, uh<br/>
Either I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin
