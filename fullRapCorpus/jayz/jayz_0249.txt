Fresh from London... Paris, Germany...<br/>
It's Euro-Jay... International Hov...<br/>
Bon Shoir, muhfuckas!... We back...<br/>
as if we never left this bitch... on top... it's worldwide...<br/>
Still Just Blaze'in this shit up...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
Every place I visit, I got land there<br/>
How could niggas stand there<br/>
Say I sound like them? Hell no<br/>
Push wigs back, push Bentley drops that's yellow<br/>
Started from the elbow, nigga, from the get-go<br/>
No, not the Geico, ain't nothin accidental<br/>
Just the facts that I've been through<br/>
Perhaps if you was into<br/>
Half of the shit I've been through<br/>
That'd make your pen move<br/>
Your mind would open, your heart would bleed<br/>
Instead y'all niggas flow oh so retardedly<br/>
You sound retarded to me!<br/>
How could you stand there, pants near down to your ass, you wanna spar with me<br/>
I'll put you down in the grass, it's the God MC, Young V-I-T-O<br/>
Young'n, you are my hijo<br/>
My son dula<br/>
I clean the cess pool up<br/>
Rap stinks<br/>
You cats are the sphinx<br/>
You cut off your nose to spite your face<br/>
Bet you like it that way don'tchya?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Don't you know?<br/>
When you're defeated, young punk?<br/>
Won't you throw<br/>
Won't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth<br/>
Don't you know that we know you're just running your mouth<br/>
Cause when this shit pops off, we gonna run in your house<br/>
Don't you know<br/>
When you're defeated, young punk?<br/>
Won't you throw?<br/>
Won't you throw in the towel? I'm better with vowels<br/>
My vocabulary murders the dictionary<br/>
Flow switches every 16, shits mean, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
Shit, I'm heavy in the game<br/>
I ain't worried bout a thing<br/>
Last man standing<br/>
Blam-blammin the cannon<br/>
48 Hours, it's Reggie Hammond<br/>
The colte, Nick Nolte<br/>
My demeanor is Humphrey Bogey<br/>
Baby, I'm comfy, cozy, my spot is solidified<br/>
Roc-a-bye baby, I sing you a lillabye<br/>
How ill am I? BK to Philladi-<br/>
Delphia! Niggas feelin how real am I<br/>
Shit, I carry two taurus, niggas they call me gemini<br/>
Though my birthday is one day before December 5<br/>
It's S Carter, the archer, I throw darts at ya<br/>
Arrows through your apparel, I will dearly depart ya<br/>
It's clearly hard for ya, what God has bestowed on me<br/>
You nah destroys me nigga; nigga I'm poetry<br/>
In four part harmony, it's like Jodeci<br/>
Check out my melody, my flow is a felony<br/>
Oh, I'm so seventies, I'm in tune with the heavenly<br/>
Governing body - Check, check, check out my destiny<br/>
I walk leaving four footprints<br/>
My hood sense<br/>
My book smarts<br/>
My faith of the unknown<br/>
And a good heart<br/>
What's seldom shown is the good part<br/>
Like I said<br/>
Try to bring em life, but they want dead<br/>
You won't listen<br/>
Hov is a nice guy, but you don't miss him<br/>
That'll piss him off quick, you won't listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i>
