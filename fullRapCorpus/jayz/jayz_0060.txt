Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump<br/>
I'm cancer to the Hamptons<br/>
20 million a wop, brand sac and mansions<br/>
Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in<br/>
Don't even trust uppity white folks<br/>
Keep the cannon tuck<br/>
Niggas trying to lean on Jay, shots gonna stand you up<br/>
Glocks gonna pop, ya not understandin much<br/>
I hustle for the thuggest<br/>
Well, now I hustle for the rust, like fuck it baby <br/>
I just love it<br/>
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it<br/>
Since my album dropped,my stock grows like I went public<br/>
Ladies I love ya<br/>
But I love my freedom more<br/>
I love my niggas, love to see them ball<br/>
I love Bean's and Bleek<br/>
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul<br/>
My disciples, and that's right we coming for the title.....<br/>
Do you believe, it's Hova the God
