<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
My nigga please, uh-huh, uh,<br/>
This my world, pimp stroll<br/>
Nigga please, you ain't start out from your trunk<br/>
Then reach the roof, just to put your roof in your trunk<br/>
Nigga please, chumps don't tour like us<br/>
You on the road a million hours, I fly over your bus<br/>
Nigga please, you ain't got your neck all froze<br/>
With the same logo that you got sketched on your clothes<br/>
Nigga please, you don't be getting no hoes<br/>
With La Perla on they cheeks, can't be messing with cheap chicks<br/>
Nigga please, you seldom seen with chicks in 7 jeans<br/>
Manolo Blahnik I'm going through they body like an ultrasonic<br/>
You ain't got 'em blowing no chronic<br/>
Divine intervention, you can't prevent me from shining<br/>
Nigga please, I been around the world<br/>
Damn near beat Jordan in around-the-world<br/>
Nigga please, you can't even hold my shoes<br/>
I got wannabes who wannabe me that sound (nigga) better than you<br/>

<i>[Chorus + ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uh, pimp strolling on 'em<br/>
Black diamonds, rose goldin' on 'em<br/>
Paper foldin' on 'em<br/>
Snuck pass the dog noses with the Foldger's on 'em<br/>
Keys, Saran Wrap with petroleum on 'em<br/>
Snitch got pinched but he toned it on 'em<br/>
Lawyers got it adjourned, try {?} on 'em<br/>
Witnesses, it's no holdin' on 'em<br/>
Just George Jefferson strollin' on 'em<br/>
Nigga please, this is me, this is real as it be<br/>
My videos is like real TV<br/>
That chick, that's me, that six, that's me<br/>
That boat, I had it on the Mediterranean sea<br/>
Nigga please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus + ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Chris]</i><br/>
Yo, yo,<br/>
Nigga please, y'all ain't seeing no checks like these (no)<br/>
Y'all don't run up in record labels demanding respect like we<br/>
Y'all don't rock your Roc-A-Wear Nike checks like we<br/>
Y'all coach class, y'all never private jet like we<br/>
My nigga please, y'all don't smoke the sour diesel like us<br/>
You don't go to Pop and get ya flour cheaper than us<br/>
Knock it off in three hours and repeat it like us<br/>
And repeat it we must, y'all don't re-up like us<br/>
Ay, y'all ain't being like us, 'cause y'all don't see it like us<br/>
The move the D's when they rush<br/>
My nigga please, they must be on E's and dust<br/>
Then niggas f'in with pills, y'all don't get G's like us<br/>
My nigga please, y'all young'ns ain't got O.G.s like me<br/>
B. Sig, Young Hov', Dame Dash, Kareem<br/>
Nigga please, somebody must've gassed your team<br/>
Think a nigga outrun or outlast gangrene (GangGreen)<br/>
My nigga please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus + ad libs]</i><br/>

<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
Amazing man, got your aerosol,<br/>
I made my money, but don't trouble the law<br/>

I got the gremlin's crazy<br/>
And wanna know the time<br/>
Better have me shades, see<br/>
My nigga please<br/>
<br/>
