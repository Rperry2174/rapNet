<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
<br/>
Momma I made it<br/>
Ya'll know how I do when the Doc do it<br/>
I fly thru it<br/>
That's how I operated<br/>
Momma I made it<br/>
Ghetto like the grease when you getting your hair braided<br/>
Sweeter than your sister Kool Aid is<br/>
Hooray is the underdog<br/>
Now my feet under desk<br/>
It's the presidential favorite<br/>
Can't believe I got away with my earlier stages<br/>
Being on stages<br/>
Having my way with<br/>
Congratulations<br/>
Ya baby boy's a made man<br/>
I'm a hold the fam down at least 3 generations<br/>
I'm talking when spaceships are around<br/>
And ya great, great grands<br/>
Reminiscing about foundation you gave 'em<br/>
For repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed <br/>
All I ask is you raise your glass  for this celebration<br/>
Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world<br/>
My inspiration, thanks for your information<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Momma I made it <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm in BK where <br/>
It ain't everyday that you make it out<br/>
To be on top of yachts waving<br/>
I remember you saving for the light bill<br/>
Paid the rent with a light bill<br/>
Now my crib dark as a basement<br/>
And you'd lock up the when you wasn't home<br/>
We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic<br/>
Our cable was basic<br/>
No HBO, no WHT<br/>
Just Ralph McDaniels on the station<br/>
I aggravated you for Atari and Coleco Vision<br/>
Pinstripe Lee's when the first day day of school came<br/>
I was OK with not having everything as long as Saturdays<br/>
You had the Commodores playing<br/>
The expression on your face was priceless<br/>
It's still with me till this day<br/>
Baby girl I won't erase it<br/>
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made <br/>
You deserve a standing ovation<br/>
Momma I made it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now your lil misfit makes sure every day is Christmas<br/>
Write down your wish list<br/>
Sixes, wrist is glistening<br/>
You don't even like jewels<br/>
But you can missing anywhere you like to<br/>
Where the water's light tube<br/>
Anything you order, sign it to your nice room<br/>
Leave an extra tip Ma<br/>
Be extra nice to 'em<br/>
CEO Carter Foundation<br/>
Wow I know pop's looking down<br/>
I know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds<br/>
Like go get 'em Grandma, make me proud<br/>
Didn't have a man in the house so you made one<br/>
So I act like ya husband and I'm only ya son<br/>
I told you one day I'll get you a home<br/>
But I didn't know it would possibly be in Rome<br/>
She told me don't wait on nobody<br/>
Get your own, so with me myself &amp; my microphone I made it<br/>
<br/>
Momma I made it....<br/>
<br/>
Momma I made it....<br/>
<br/>
