It's a Dynasty! Who do you believe?<br/>
<br/>
Jigga Man, mo' better, mo' cheddar<br/>
Foes knock the man off your Polo sweater<br/>
Roll with the R-O-C, A-Fella<br/>
Remember me? The teachers used to fail us<br/>
Now it's mo' scrilla, hoe killers<br/>
Fo'-wheelers, we - gorillas<br/>
Oh please feel us - we heat holders<br/>
Fightin? Listen boy, Roy Jones couldn't still us<br/>
The plot thickens, the block clickin<br/>
We got the game tied up, stop trippin<br/>
Jigga Man huh? Sigel Sigel y'all<br/>
Memph Bleek what? Amil-lion, uhh<br/>
Cat be him, El Cap-i-tan<br/>
The fire I spit burn down Happyland<br/>
Social Club, we unapproachable thugs<br/>
Non-social, gone postal<br/>
Great aim, harm the arm close to your toast<br/>
like a Don's supposed to, Shawn<br/>
I thought I told you, these ain't just vocals<br/>
Don't make me take it to the old school<br/>
I put holes through your hoes too<br/>
through your clothes to the foes to the nigga close to you<br/>
Fuck it; Jigga Man huh? Sigel Sigel y'all<br/>

<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Y'all dudes don't - get it, come widdit<br/>
Fifth loaded with slugs that'll rest in your fitted<br/>
It's M dot E-M, the Roc be them<br/>
Got the mamis sayin look, who can stop be them?<br/>
You wan' press your dumb luck, get blam blam-ed up<br/>
I crush your larynx, you talk 'bout us nigga<br/>
No obituary, I get it critical<br/>
You know Memph'll hit the pall bearer liftin you<br/>
When I cock the plastic, make 'em drop the casket<br/>
When it's hot, I'm blastin, it's the Roc, you bastards<br/>
Jigga Man what? Amil-lion yeah<br/>
Memph Bleek huh? Sigel Sigel c'mon<br/>

Witcha bullshit smash hit, get your bullshit smashed in<br/>
Niggaz wanna front and get jumped<br/>
Bet the ruger give your right side a nice-sized lump<br/>
Nigga, we are, the supreme squad<br/>
You can dream hard but reality is<br/>
we push the dream cars, fuck the queen broads<br/>
puff the green raw, we as real as it get<br/>
We the R-O-C dot A dot Fellas<br/>
Bitches don't talk to us, the hoes they e-mail us<br/>

<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
R (dot) O (dot) C (dot) stop<br/>
From tower to mind pop, I move out stop<br/>
Shower your mind block, move out with glocks<br/>
Raw to the cook, look, move out them blocks<br/>
Take it to the bucks who be grindin it up<br/>
Usually take it to the dubs so they diamond it up<br/>
Competition, linin 'em up<br/>
Forty-five ACP, let me squeeze lime 'em up<br/>
You want, drama what? Well silence it up<br/>
Since a young buck, violent as fuck<br/>
Wettin me dog, the high will do it; I used to wild off embalmin fluid<br/>
I send niggaz to the trauma unit<br/>
Forty-five or the nine'll do it<br/>
I fuck around and have your moms go through it - I'm a beast!<br/>
Shit, niggaz always wanna ye shit, then they wanna cease shit<br/>
when they motherfuckin peeps hit<br/>
But I don't cease nuttin, I decease som'un<br/>
I fuck around and have you sleepin underneath som'un<br/>
Jigga Man what? Sigel Sigel y'all<br/>
Memph Bleek uh, Amil-lion right<br/>

<i>[Amil]</i><br/>
Yo, A to the M-I, feminist<br/>
Holdin the semi, leave niggaz faced with a dilemmi<br/>
Am I, gon' run or stay, can I<br/>

And I, lazy bop, Mercedes hot<br/>
In my way through the tunnel like Lady Di<br/>
<br/>
