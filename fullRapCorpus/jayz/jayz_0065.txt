<i>[Intro: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Let's go<br/>
Hov!<br/>
Uh huh, Hov'<br/>
You, are, not, ready<br/>
Hov', unstoppable, Dynasty, young Hova<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Pharrell Williams (J.U.I.C.E.)]</i><br/>
I'm a hustler baby, I'm a hustler<br/>
I just want you to know, wanna let you know<br/>
It aint where I been, it aint where I been<br/>
But where I'm bout to go, top of the world!<br/>
Now I just wanna love you, just wanna love you<br/>
But be who I am, you know you love me<br/>
And with all this cash, mo' money, mo' problems<br/>
You'll forget your man<br/>
Now give it to me<br/>
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff<br/>
But don't bullshit me<br/>
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin<br/>
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin<br/>
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation<br/>
Y'all be chasin, I replace them, huh?<br/>
Drunk off Crist', mami on E<br/>
Can't keep her little model hands off me<br/>
Both in the club, high, singing off key<br/>
"And I wish I never met her at all..."<br/>
It gets better, ordered another round<br/>
It's, about, to go, down<br/>
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'<br/>
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere<br/>
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses<br/>
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion<br/>
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra<br/>
Filth Mart jeans, take that off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Pharrell Williams (J.U.I.C.E.)]</i><br/>
Give it to me<br/>
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff<br/>
But don't bullshit me<br/>
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)<br/>
I said give it to me<br/>
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff<br/>
But don't bullshit me<br/>
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, save the narrative, you savin it for marriage<br/>
Let's keep it real ma, you savin it for karats<br/>
You wanna see how far I'ma go<br/>
How, much I'ma spend but you already know<br/>
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero<br/>
Might buy you Crist', but that about it<br/>
Might light your wrist, but that about it<br/>
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips<br/>
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick<br/>
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless<br/>
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down<br/>
Get you bling like the Neptune sound<br/>
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold<br/>
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul<br/>
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies<br/>
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Pharrell Williams (J.U.I.C.E.)]</i><br/>
Give it to me<br/>
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff<br/>
But don't bullshit me<br/>
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)<br/>
I said give it to me<br/>
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff<br/>
But don't bullshit me<br/>
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)<br/>
I'm a hustler baby, uh, Hov'<br/>
I just want you to know, Hov'<br/>
It aint where I been<br/>
But where I'm bout to go, Hov', Hov'<br/>
Now I just wanna love you, young Hova<br/>
But be who I am, know you love me<br/>
And with all this cash, mo' money, mo' problems<br/>
You'll forget your man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Same song, I'm back, been around the world<br/>
Ro-mancing girls that dance with girls<br/>
From, Club Cheetah, to Club Amnesia<br/>
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin<br/>
Can't deny me, why would you want to<br/>
You need me, why don't you try me<br/>
Baby you want to, believe me, Hov'!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Pharrell Williams (J.U.I.C.E.)]</i><br/>
Give it to me<br/>
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff<br/>
But don't bullshit me<br/>
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)<br/>
I said give it to me<br/>
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff<br/>
But don't bullshit me<br/>
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)<br/>
<br/>
You gotta...<br/>
Give it to me<br/>
Uh, uh huh
