<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Geyeah, NYMP the realest, uhh<br/>
This is educated thug MU-SIC, niggaz<br/>
<br/>
Life's a battle, mean streets eat you alive<br/>
Blocks'll have you, tryin to maintain your course<br/>
through the potholes and gravel<br/>
Hot holes and what-have-you, tryin to clock dough<br/>
Foes tryin to pop shots through you by code<br/>
Pigs tryin to grab you and lock up your soul<br/>
Through the Hot Apple, nighttime shots crackle<br/>
(bucka bucka bucka) Fiends tryin to gaffle you<br/>
Not only cokeheads but the Feds in the Mercuray Topaz<br/>
after you, up the avenue<br/>
Tryin to give you big numbers, you got math to do<br/>
Tryin to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool<br/>
I caught smaller cases tryin to get cap or two<br/>
Up against the wall, tryin to pass through<br/>
Ghost-like, hear the cries from the tortured souls<br/>
Most nights, I hold my toast tight, and it goes like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz<br/>
N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz<br/>
Uhh, uh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest<br/>
Marcy.. Brooklyn..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yo; I come through, gettin money, sittin on twenties<br/>
Niggaz throwin me shade, but ain't shit sunny<br/>
Hot shells only thing niggaz could get from me<br/>
Cocktails thrown in your living room, KA-BOOM<br/>
I'm so confrontational;<br/>
they shoulda never let me go on probation yo<br/>
I'm a hustler; except that..<br/>
no correctional facilities can correct that<br/>
I took a step back, I viewed myself, seen where my head was at<br/>
It's where that dough is homey, gotta get that<br/>
Gotta get away, some try but head back<br/>
Uhh, street smart niggaz got left back<br/>
Some died, they left stacks<br/>
Me, I ball right, and on top of that I'm dog nice<br/>
Jigga been cold as fuck before ice<br/>
Not before Christ, but a long fuckin time<br/>
Get your mind right niggaz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
N.Y.M.P., the realest<br/>
Uh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz<br/>
Uhh uh-huh, uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggaz<br/>
Marcy.. feel me..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I looked Death in the face years back<br/>
I held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back<br/>
I'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live<br/>
You gotta bounce back homey, the streets don't give<br/>
I take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?<br/>
Not Rudy Guiliani, not Hillary Rodham<br/>
Still I still pop him<br/>
Shit I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now<br/>
I think big when I spit at you now<br/>
Between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha<br/>
Between life and death, they killed my spirit<br/>
So what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball<br/>
I ? myself, teacher said I was a lost cause<br/>
cause I used to roam them halls<br/>
Still I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college<br/>
Who woulda thought I'd make it "Big" like Ms. Wallace?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, yeah, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz<br/>
Brooklyn, what? N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz<br/>
Uhh, uh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggaz<br/>
Marcy.. Brooklyn, N.Y.M.P. the realest, feel me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Educated, thug mu-sic niggaz<br/>
This is Brooklyn, this is gangsta, this is project<br/>
Real shit, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggaz<br/>
Marcy, Brooklyn, stompin grounds<br/>
Fuck with me
