<i>[talking]</i><br/>
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home<br/>
Ya understand?  Once you memorize a sentence<br/>
It's like an exercise <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[heavy breathing]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Ya niggas can't be serious right now<br/>
I'm the all time heavy weight champion of flowers<br/>
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now<br/>
Best flow, Most consistent, Realest stories<br/>
Most charisma, I set the most trends<br/>
And my interviews are hotter<br/>
Holla<br/>
<br/>
I jog in the graveyard<br/>
Spar in the same ring<br/>
Now it's house by the building<br/>
Where Malcolm X was slain<br/>
I spring train in the winter<br/>
Round early December<br/>
Run suicide drills over and over<br/>
With the weight of the world on my shoulder<br/>
That's why they call me "Hova"<br/>
I'm far from being God<br/>
But I work goddamn hard<br/>
I wake up the birds who in the nerves is sleep<br/>
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one end<br/>
I am "focused man"<br/>
And I'm not afraid of death<br/>
And I'm going all out<br/>
I circle the vultures in a van and<br/>
I run the block (run)<br/>
Pull up in a drop (pull up)<br/>
Push up on my money (push up)<br/>
I'm in great shape dunny<br/>
I keep jacks jumping thirty six sets<br/>
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch<br/>
I pump and rock sweats<br/>
All white trainers<br/>
The ghettoes, Billy Blanks<br/>
I show you niggas what pain is<br/>
Maintain your stamina<br/>
Hov will damage ya<br/>
Spot you two rhymes y'all niggas is amateurs<br/>
The fifth<br/>
A dead lift if<br/>
Niggas don't want to get shot then y'all niggas better squat<br/>
I drop your set for rep<br/>
No need to hit the showers<br/>
The spit from the fifth leave you wet<br/>
Lyrical exercise<br/>
<i>[hard breathing]</i><br/>
Y'all niggas ain't tired right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4X]</i><br/>
One, One<br/>
Two, Two<br/>
Three, Three<br/>
Four, Breathe Easy<br/>
<br/>
Suckers<br/>
Get your weight up<br/>
Not your hate up<br/>
Jigga man is diesel<br/>
When I lift the eight up<br/>
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy<br/>
Your flow is brain on drugs<br/>
Mines is rap on steroids<br/>
I lift every voice when I sing<br/>
My ability<br/>
Make yours look like an exercise in futility<br/>
Bring your squad<br/>
Biceps, Triceps, and Quads<br/>
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles<br/>
Y'all ain't real<br/>
That's y'all Achilles Heel<br/>
Same routine when you see me you know the drill<br/>
I spot ya<br/>
I lift the weight of the watch off your arm<br/>
Remain nice and calm<br/>
Put down your things<br/>
Trinidad of the game know my way around your ring<br/>
No matter how many pounds you bring<br/>
It sounds like the same old thing<br/>
R-O-C is the strongest team<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4X]</i>
