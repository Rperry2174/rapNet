<i>[Intro: Pimp C]</i><br/>
Little over a year ago I was in bondage<br/>
And now I'm back out here reaping the blessings<br/>
And getting the benefits that go along with it<br/>
Everything that's out here for kings like us<br/>
The reason why we like this this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff<br/>
They don't understand is because we really from Africa<br/>
And that's where all this stuff come from<br/>
And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying<br/>
So don't look down on the youngsters<br/>
Because they wanna have shiny things<br/>
It's in our genes, know what I'm saying<br/>
We just don't all know our history so...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Fuck with me, you know I got it<br/>
Fuck with me, you know I got it<br/>
Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it<br/>
Come fuck with me, you know I got it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I just landed in Europe, nigga<br/>
Shopping bags, I'm a tourist, nigga<br/>
Money talk I speak fluent, nigga<br/>
Reeboks on, I just do it, nigga<br/>
Look at me, I'm pure nigga<br/>
I bet the hoes on my tour, nigga<br/>
I don't bop, I do the money dance<br/>
My bitch whip cost a hundred grand<br/>
Red vert, tou see me slide<br/>
Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it<br/>
Sexy bitch I know she 'bout it<br/>
Fuck with me, you know I got it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hov just landed in Rome, nigga<br/>
All hail, Caesar's home, niggas<br/>
Chin don, Ciao Bella<br/>
Come money dance with the good fellas<br/>
Hov keep gettin' that dinero, got it<br/>
Even if a nigga gotta Robert, get it?<br/>
Black Jack in casino<br/>
A nigga got unlimited credit<br/>
A nigga got a lot of vendettas<br/>
But we the Black mob, we gonna set it<br/>
Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach<br/>
200 in the dash we gonna rev it, skirt<br/>
Lucky Luciano is what that call me Paisano<br/>
A 100 keys at the piano plays across the Verrazano<br/>
El Padrino, in the villa in Venice sipping vino<br/>
Not bad for a Mulliano, y'all know like we know, I got it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I'm riding big coming down that beach<br/>
Geechy niggas with satin sheets<br/>
Bad bitch, she a masterpiece<br/>
Got a bad bitch, she a masterpiece
