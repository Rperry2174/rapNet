<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uh-uhh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Blackstreet]</i><br/>
You belong to the city (Uh-uhh-uh, what what)<br/>
You belong to the night (Uh-uhh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah)<br/>
In the river of darkness<br/>
He's a man of the night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, yeah<br/>
What the deal playboy, just rest your soul<br/>
I be holding it down yo still love the dough<br/>
Got these ladies on the cock now you know how we go<br/>
Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow<br/>
Don't worry about Brooklyn I continue to flame<br/>
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name<br/>
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns<br/>
And just like your spirit the commision remains<br/>
Niggaz can cross the T's and, dots the I's<br/>
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies<br/>
I'm takin this rap shit serious, to my demise<br/>
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise<br/>
Basics in the basement, waste it<br/>
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit<br/>
my hatred is, fueled just give me a sign<br/>
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Blackstreet]</i><br/>
You belong to the city (The city is mine, what-what-what)<br/>
You belong to the night (Ge-ge-geyeah, uh-uhh-uh, pa-pau)<br/>
In the river of darkness<br/>
He's a man of the night (The city is mine, that's right...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Jay-Z<br/>
Y'all want to know how I flow just seek and you find<br/>
I'm like a brain in the voicebox, I speak my mind<br/>
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm<br/>
the illest nigga doing it or these niggaz is losin it<br/>
I read a article that said I was ruinin shit<br/>
But every time I look, I'm movin units in quick<br/>
So I'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split<br/>
and leave niggaz with nothing but my influences-es<br/>
Soon it's the Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit<br/>
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit<br/>
I'm the type to buy a Roley and just ice my shit<br/>
on the spot, fuck comin back twice to shit<br/>
How real is that? My floss game, still intact<br/>
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that<br/>
Like the first dude to cop the 850 and 89<br/>
and drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Blackstreet]</i><br/>
You belong to the city (The city is mine)<br/>
You belong to the night (Yeah, uhh, the city is mine)<br/>
In the river of darkness (Pa-pa, feel me)<br/>
He's a man of the night (Yeah, yeah, bounce, bounce)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I snatch your girl cause your arm ain't strong enough<br/>
Plus ya don't stay in the studio long enough<br/>
I make hits while y'all stay hatin and take bricks<br/>
Had it locked til I came in the club, Take 6<br/>
Got your chick cause you swore she was innocent<br/>
Got her a Chinese manicure hair done by Dominicans, all for what<br/>
So I could be in a dark corner, all in the butt<br/>
at the bar alchoholing her up<br/>
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream<br/>
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth<br/>
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name<br/>
I ain't a player get it right, I'm controllin the game<br/>
From now until they blow holes in my frame<br/>
I'ma stand firm, holdin my aim, feel me?<br/>
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime<br/>
on the low though - shhhhh, the city is mine!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ variations to end]</i>
