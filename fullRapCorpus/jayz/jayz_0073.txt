Uh huh<br/>

Is y'all ready??<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK 2X:]</i><br/>
Holla!<br/>
If you real and you know you a G<br/>
Holla!<br/>
Deep in these streets when you pumpin that D<br/>
Holla!<br/>
Be in your hood screamin fuck police<br/>
Holla!<br/>
You keep a gun and you bust for beef<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Niggas say I'm focused now, they know that's my style<br/>
But dogg, I'm on the block with that coke and a smile<br/>
I still got the crack heads I.D.<br/>
And they know, I collect for the first and fifteenth<br/>
I still take cabs to that capsule spot<br/>
For them 31 illusions and them purple tops<br/>
And the game aint change, niggas is taught different<br/>
I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slippin<br/>
That's why I eat, sleep, shit with my gat<br/>
Bag up, take a piss, fuck a bitch with my gat<br/>
And I done sold it all from crack to marijuana<br/>
You can't deny it, I'm in hoods like Tom Warner<br/>
Beat cop, take away, I keep my shit<br/>
They don't know I deliver off the beeps I get<br/>
And you snitch ass niggas wanna peep my shit<br/>
But I'ma show you how deep into these streets I get<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
See what this game made, and (of age I came)<br/>
And you up and coming rappers know you young to this game<br/>
(I went from Marcy to Hollywood, I'm back again)<br/>
I don't need no applaud, to clap again<br/>
Let alone, no award, from rap to win<br/>
Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in<br/>
Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine lime-a<br/>
Cut your hand off if you fuckin with my product<br/>
That slayed shit, I'm on the grave shift<br/>
We all know fucked up money don't pay rent<br/>
You short with my ones, you short one thumb<br/>
You can't, come up short where the fuck I'm from<br/>
We got, dues to pay, new tools to spray<br/>
Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today<br/>
You know the ooze'll spray if you refuse to pay<br/>
And I move the yae nigga day by day<br/>
<br/>
