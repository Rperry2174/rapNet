<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Motherfuckers -<br/>
say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)<br/>
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?<br/>
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined<br/>
That same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin<br/>
what I do through and through and<br/>
I give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view<br/>
The renegade; you been afraid<br/>
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they<br/>
pop toasters, and they live with they moms<br/>
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over<br/>
Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over<br/>
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked<br/>
No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down<br/>
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round<br/>
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways<br/>
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day<br/>
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?<br/>
I help them see they way through it - not you<br/>
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes<br/>
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen<br/>
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute<br/>
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it<br/>
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it<br/>
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics<br/>
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics<br/>
usin his music to steer it sharin his views in his marriage<br/>
But there's a huge interference - they're sayin you shouldn't hear it<br/>
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit<br/>
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish<br/>
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America<br/>
as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment?<br/>
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror<br/>
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased<br/>
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents<br/>
You fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!<br/>
(Ha ha!) And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't<br/>
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo<br/>
Cause here we go - he's {*Jigga joint Jigga-chk-Jigga*}<br/>
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem + Jay-Z]</i><br/>
<i>[Em]</i> RENEGADE!  Never been afraid to say<br/>
what's on my mind at, any given time of day<br/>
Cause I'm a RENEGADE!  Never been afraid to talk<br/>
about anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> Never been afraid to say<br/>
what's on my mind at, any given time of day<br/>
Cause I'm a {RENEGADE} Never been afraid to holler<br/>
about anything {anything?} Anything {ANYTHING!}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles<br/>
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent<br/>
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench<br/>
Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in<br/>
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver<br/>
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope<br/>
Do not step to me - I'm awkward, I box leftier often<br/>
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home<br/>
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights<br/>
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings<br/>
My demeanor - thirty years my senior<br/>
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up<br/>
Raisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky<br/>
Big I did it - multi before I die (nigga)<br/>
No lie, just know I chose my own fate<br/>
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare<br/>
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here<br/>
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me<br/>
as a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist<br/>
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste<br/>
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is<br/>
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?<br/>
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today<br/>
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie<br/>
while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me<br/>
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics<br/>
in holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer<br/>
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful<br/>
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you<br/>
What did I do? (huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter<br/>
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muh'fuckin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i>
