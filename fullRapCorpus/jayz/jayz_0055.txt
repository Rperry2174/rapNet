<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in<br/>
Thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in<br/>
Really a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin<br/>
but when the gat is tucked, I'm fat as fuck<br/>
Ignorant bastard, I'm takin it back to day one<br/>
No kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun<br/>
For niggaz that think I spend my days in the sun<br/>
well here's the shock of your life, the glock not the mic<br/>
Homey I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street<br/>
You still fuckin up then trust me I still creep<br/>
Yeah I know the platinum chain be lookin real sweet<br/>
but reach and I bury niggaz sixty feet deep<br/>
S dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs<br/>
Seperate fathers from they daughters, why bother<br/>
I'm a crook like you, I took like you<br/>
I disobeyed the law threw out the book like you<br/>
How dare you look at Jigga like I'm shook like boo<br/>
I keep the fifth with me nigga, come and get me..<br/>
<br/>
COME AND GET ME!<br/>
<i>[gong sounds]</i> Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-come..<br/>
<i>[bell rings]</i> COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka-COME AND GET ME! ..<br/>
<i>[bell rings]</i> COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka..<br/>
<i>[bell rings]</i> .. Ka-ka-ka-ka-come<br/>
<i>[bell rings]</i> .. come and get me COME AND GET ME<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Don't know what y'all niggaz is<br/>
tryin to do but I don't like it<br/>
Yeah, straight gangster shit<br/>
Heyyyy, uh-huh-uh-uhh gangster shit<br/>
Uhh, straight gangster nigga<br/>
Roc..<br/>
<br/>
Yo, your summer's bout to get hot<br/>
Niggaz home from jail and they plottin<br/>
Heard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top<br/>
The Continental T, got em resentin me<br/>
God I work hard, please don't envy me<br/>
I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard<br/>
I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job<br/>
All y'all remember is the part about me parkin the hog<br/>
What about all them days I was walkin my dogs?<br/>
Barkin at broads, but they never hollered back<br/>
And if they did all they said was, "Where dem dollaz at?"<br/>
Imagine, bein skinny growin up around broader cats<br/>
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats<br/>
until I got a gat and loudly start poppin back<br/>
Round the way, niggaz called me Bobby Bouchete<br/>
Now all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay<br/>
How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away<br/>
Pull out your gat, car jack me take my cruise away<br/>
Well I got news for y'all fools today, hey..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got, shots to give come and get me nigga<br/>
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga<br/>
I won't, part with this come and get me nigga<br/>
I worked, hard for this come and get me nigga<br/>
I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME..<br/>
COME AND GET ME..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good<br/>
I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood<br/>
Made em relate to your struggle, told em bout your hustle<br/>
Went on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you<br/>
You know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin witchu<br/>
Til I made em understand why you do what you do<br/>
I expected to hear, "Jay, if it wasn't for you.."<br/>
But instead, all I hear is buzzin in your crew<br/>
How y'all scheamin, tryin to get accustomed to my moves<br/>
So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house<br/>
But I got pride I'm a nigga first<br/>
I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first<br/>
That's how Jigga work<br/>
The funny thing; I represent y'all everytime I spit a verse<br/>
and that's the shit that hurts<br/>
But hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here<br/>
So when y'all feel that the time is right..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Aiy yo yo, aiy yo yo<br/>
It's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle<br/>
I'm treatin it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna<br/>
My game change but my mindframe remains the same<br/>
I gotta protect what's mine<br/>
Shit I started from nothin; zero, zip<br/>
I made my way hustlin, I don't owe niggaz shit<br/>
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped<br/>
Cats I played skelly with? Niggaz done flipped<br/>
I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip<br/>
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift<br/>
I keep one under the chair where I sit<br/>
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch<br/>
Ask Big; everytime he'd come to my crib<br/>
he'd find another gun that I hid<br/>
I'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is<br/>
Everyday like a hundred-and-six.. shit..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Motherfuckers!
