<i>[singing: Paul Anka + (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Now, the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?)<br/>
So I face (I'm from the hood man) the final curtain<br/>
(No the REAL hood the hood, not the RAP hood)<br/>
(The REAL hood, like three pair of pants)<br/>
My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)<br/>
(My moms is bustin her ass) State my case<br/>
(Nigga I'm going to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain<br/>
(You understand what I'm saying?  Can you believe that?)<br/>
I lived a life that's full (They have people, waiting)<br/>
(at the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or somethin)<br/>
(That's really somethin!) And I travelled each, and every highway<br/>
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more<br/>
Much more than this (still here) I did it my way<br/>
Let's try this one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z + (singer)]</i><br/>
Uhh, yeah... gangsta nigga!<br/>
Put my hustle down, tore the game up nigga<br/>
Took your high score down, put my name up nigga<br/>
Tore the doors down 'til the Hall of Fame is Jigga<br/>
I did it my way (and more.. much more than this)<br/>
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!<br/>
(I did it my way) I did it my way -- Hovi baby!<br/>
<br/>
Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas<br/>
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform<br/>
Pop hurting assertive, flirted with death<br/>
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf<br/>
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand<br/>
how there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor<br/>
Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse<br/>
as a reminder that I make top paper?<br/>
Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors<br/>
Nobody gave us shit, we made us<br/>
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis<br/>
Big's the smart one on the low like Dean Martin<br/>
We came in this game, not beggin niggas pardon<br/>
Demanding y'all respect, hand over a check<br/>
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet<br/>
We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick<br/>
They new every year I was droppin new product<br/>
I was raisin the stock up, while building the Roc up<br/>
But that's alright, cause they knew they had to see us<br/>
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-ires<br/>
Je-je-jeah!<br/>
<br/>
(And more, much more than this; I did it my way)<br/>
<br/>
Jeah!  "In My Lifetime"<br/>
I caught smaller cases, but I had capital<br/>
Hypocritic system let me right back at you<br/>
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you<br/>
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude<br/>
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap<br/>
And they can look good by paintin him as bad news<br/>
Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views<br/>
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word<br/>
So imagine how disturbed I was<br/>
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club<br/>
Let me explain exactly how this shit was<br/>
This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin<br/>
But it's cool cause he's back friends, and half-inning is over<br/>
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to being Hova<br/>
Maybach with the chauffeur, laid back<br/>
Helicopter seat, feat inclined, shit feeling like a sofa<br/>
Helicopter meet me, Teterburo take me over<br/>
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speaking of vultures<br/>
So the next time that page six approaches us<br/>
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my - way<br/>
<br/>
(And more, much more than this; I did it my way)
