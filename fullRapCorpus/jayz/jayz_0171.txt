<i>[Intro: Jay-Z + (Beyonce)]</i><br/>
IT AIN'T FOR EVERYBODY!<br/>
(Uhhhh) Welcome to Hollywood baby<br/>
(Take a picture) Uh huh<br/>
You coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)<br/>
Let's do it (Let's Go!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1: Beyonce + (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
(Uh huh) I see your jealousy as you watching<br/>
(I see you watching me baby) You watching (It's all good)<br/>
It's kinda sexy to me how you watching (I love it) You watching<br/>
(Uh huh come on)<br/>
I see your face (I see your face)<br/>
You wanna touch it (You wanna touch it)<br/>
Come to my place (Come to the crib)<br/>
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)<br/>
Tonight you'll be (Tonight you gonna be a superstar baby)<br/>
a superstar<br/>
come let me sign you up<br/>
(let's get into it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce + (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Ooh it's the lights (You blinded by the)<br/>
Action! (You need that)<br/>
Hollywood<br/>
Ooh it's the lights (You blinded by the)<br/>
Satisfaction! (You need that)<br/>
Hollywood<br/>
(Uh huh come on)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Paparazzi spots me<br/>
In the lobby<br/>
Of my high-rise<br/>
I hide<br/>
Behind my shades<br/>
Cause the fame is blinding my eyes<br/>
My god<br/>
I know how Ozzie Oz<br/>
Once had felt when he was as high<br/>
As I have got<br/>
I have got<br/>
To make this stop<br/>
People often warn me<br/>
That the fame ain't for the vain if heart<br/>
It'll change those<br/>
Who they had love for you<br/>
Into strangers<br/>
When your fame starts<br/>
It's a chain reaction<br/>
Locomotion like when the train departs<br/>
Stranger<br/>
Things have happened<br/>
Rapping<br/>
Stacking<br/>
Platinum plaquin'<br/>
Born in Brooklyn got a place in Manhattan<br/>
Going back to Brooklyn<br/>
To escape the madness<br/>
When your friends is<br/>
Chris and Gwyneth<br/>
When your girl is more famous<br/>
Then you then is<br/>
Time to get all your windows tinted<br/>
Keep your eyes squinted<br/>
It's gonna flash any minute<br/>
The music biz is like musical chairs<br/>
Its about where you standing when the music stop spinning<br/>
In a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce Verse + (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
You got to get it<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
Do you want it<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
But you don't need it<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
What do you do (now that you got what you want)<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
What do you do (oh you want more?)<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hey mister<br/>
Pay sixa<br/>
A lista<br/>
You're in the mist of<br/>
The ride of your life<br/>
But you gotta keep them hits up<br/>
Can't put your guard down<br/>
Gotta keep your mitts up<br/>
Take a sip sir<br/>
It's so in toxicating<br/>
ain't it<br/>
try not to get jaded<br/>
Hollywood's been good to ya<br/>
Startin' feel like birds to ya<br/>
Don't lie<br/>
Gonna fly<br/>
You addicted to the lights<br/>
Without the fame<br/>
How you gonna survive<br/>
It's like living on<br/>
Heroine<br/>
You so high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2: Beyonce + (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
And everybody warning you about it (Try to told you)<br/>
And once you taste you can't live without it (It's addictive)<br/>
Not cause you choose to not live without it (Sure you want this baby)<br/>
It's now a part of you (It's a part of you)<br/>
It's now a part of you<br/>
And everybody warning you about it (I see you blinded)<br/>
And once you taste you can't live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (with minor ad-libs from Beyonce)]</i><br/>
Ooh it's the lights (It's the lights)<br/>
Action! (Action)<br/>
Hollywood (Hollywood)<br/>
Ooh it's the lights (Satisfaction)<br/>
Satisfaction! (So addictive)<br/>
(Hey) Hollywood (Hollywood)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Wanna be seen<br/>
Male groupies<br/>
now you've become what you once despised<br/>
James Dean<br/>
John Belushi<br/>
Blow your whole life<br/>
Tryna live in the lights<br/>
Heroins following Marilyn<br/>
Hoppin' over the edge<br/>
just like Janice Joplin<br/>
River Phoenix<br/>
Jimi Hendrix<br/>
All of them ended by<br/>
Hollywood<br/>
Thank God for Hollywood<br/>
Hollywood<br/>
Sure you want this baby?<br/>
<i>[Throughout end of verse 3]</i><br/>
(Oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hollywood<br/>
Most addicted drug in the world<br/>
Want the fame<br/>
Want the lights<br/>
Ha Ha Ha
