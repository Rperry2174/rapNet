<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Uh-huh<br/>
<i>[$hort]</i> That's right<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago<br/>
<i>[$hort]</i> Last week I had everything<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago<br/>
<i>[$hort]</i> I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago<br/>
<i>[$hort]</i> and the jewelry..<br/>
and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Uh-huh, uh uh, yo<br/>
<i>[$hort]</i> Beyotch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Growin up in the hood just my dog and me<br/>
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see<br/>
Problems, I called on him, he called on me<br/>
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P<br/>
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys<br/>
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially<br/>
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me<br/>
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly<br/>
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me<br/>
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed<br/>
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change<br/>
And when he called collect and I heard his name<br/>
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone<br/>
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone<br/>
I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"<br/>
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."<br/>
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone<br/>
The crackers up there bleachin your dome, you're reachin<br/>
I said, "The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on."<br/>
From there I sensed the beef was on<br/>
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone<br/>
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone<br/>
Can't be too safe cause niggaz is two-faced<br/>
And they show the other side when they catch a new case<br/>
It's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Too $hort, Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke<br/>
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks<br/>
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked<br/>
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago)<br/>
<br/>
Funny what, seven days can change<br/>
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim<br/>
Used to have a firm grip now you droppin names<br/>
Uh-huh, uh-huh (It was all good just a week ago)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell<br/>
We both came in this game, blind as hell<br/>
I did a little better, had more clientele<br/>
Told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail<br/>
Seventeen and I'm holdin on to around a mill<br/>
I could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill<br/>
Had niggaz thinkin I was from Uptown for real<br/>
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill<br/>
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville<br/>
Down and dirty, down to fight the round thirty<br/>
Freezin on them corners still holdin my crack<br/>
Lookin up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?<br/>
Came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack<br/>
You tell them feds I said I'm never goin back<br/>
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats<br/>
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin some things<br/>
All this after a week in the bang<br/>
I'm mad at myself cause I didn't spot the weak and lame<br/>
I woulda bet the house you wouldn't speak a thang<br/>
Nigga this was the oath, to the top of broke<br/>
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us<br/>
we sposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?<br/>
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor<br/>
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry<br/>
That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die<br/>
It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap<br/>
Who woulda thought you'd get popped one time and rap?<br/>
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad<br/>
and your son gotta grow up like, "This is my dad?"<br/>
The labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar<br/>
You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Too $hort]</i><br/>
Shit is crazy man<br/>
All these niggaz out here snitchin<br/>
We was one step away from takin this crack money<br/>
and recyclin it through the ghettoes<br/>
and buildin back up our own hoods<br/>
Now all you niggaz start snitchin on each other<br/>
I got partners doin 15-20<br/>
Wouldn'ta been doin SHIT<br/>
if you didn't snitch<br/>
Beyotch!<br/>
It's about time y'all check that shit out man<br/>
It ain't all good<br/>
Shut your mouth<br/>
Just watch the game<br/>
And don't snitch<br/>
It sure will do a lot for you<br/>
Believe that baby<br/>
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house main<br/>
You know I got it<br/>
Got it goin on<br/>
We got the money<br/>
Ain't got nuthin to do with crime baby<br/>
But I'm recognizing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You rat bastard!
