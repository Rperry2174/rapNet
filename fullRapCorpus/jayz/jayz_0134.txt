<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Now can I get an encore, do you want more<br/>
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy<br/>
So for one last time I need y'all to roar<br/>
<br/>
Now what the hell are you waitin for<br/>
After me, there shall be no more<br/>
So for one last time, nigga make some noise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Who you know fresher than Hov'?  Riddle me that<br/>
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at<br/>
Can't none of y'all mirror me back<br/>
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime<br/>
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead<br/>
Back to take over the globe, now break bread<br/>
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express<br/>
Out the country but the blueberry still connect<br/>
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck<br/>
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect?  Yep, yep<br/>
Grand openin, grand closin<br/>
God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again<br/>
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen<br/>
just draw off inspiration<br/>
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him<br/>
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
{What the hell are you waiting forrrr?}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
<i>[sighs]</i> Look what you made me do, look what I made for you<br/>
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you<br/>
When you first come in the game, they try to play you<br/>
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you<br/>
From Marcy to Madison Square<br/>
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)<br/>
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears<br/>
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye<br/>
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5<br/>
It ain't to play games witchu<br/>
It's to aim at you, probably maim you<br/>
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens<br/>
Cocksucker take one for your team<br/>
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)<br/>
I came, I saw, I conquered<br/>
From record sales, to sold out concerts<br/>
So muh'fucker if you want this encore<br/>
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
OWWWW!  It's star time<br/>
This man is MADE!  He's KILLIN all y'all jive turkeys<br/>
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?<br/>
Well if y'all want more of the Jigga man<br/>
Then I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage<br/>
Say Hova, c'mon say it!<br/>
HO-VA!  HO-VA!  Are y'all out there? <i>[crowd chants "HO-VA! HO-VA!"]</i><br/>
Are y'all out there?  C'mon, louder!<br/>
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talkin bout<br/>
They love you Jigga - they love you Jigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I like the way this one feel<br/>
It's so muh'fuckin soulful man!<br/>
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)<br/>
Yeah <i>[crowd still chanting]</i> okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
So this here is the victory lap<br/>
Then I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back<br/>
After a year of them 16's, it's one point two<br/>
And that's two point four, and I'm only doin two<br/>
You wanted to gain attention new dudes<br/>
I can get you BET and TRL too<br/>
You wanna be in the public, send your budget<br/>
Well fuck it, I ain't budgin!<br/>
Young did it to death, you gotta love it<br/>
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it<br/>
Now look at me, all star-studded<br/>
Golfer above par like I putted<br/>
All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous<br/>
How sick is this?<br/>
You want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some dust<br/>
Send Hip a grip, then you got' spit<br/>
A little somethin like this, WOO!<br/>
<br/>
{What the hell are you waiting forrrr?}<br/>
