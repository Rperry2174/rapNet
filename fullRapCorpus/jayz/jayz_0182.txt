And the winner is Hov...my man? SPEECH!<br/>
<br/>
First of all I wan' thank my connect<br/>
The most important person with all due respect<br/>
Thanks for to duffle bag, the brown paper bag<br/>
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash<br/>
Boys in blue who put greed before the badge<br/>
The first pusher whoever made the stash<br/>
The Roc Boys in the building tonight<br/>
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling life<br/>
Thanks to the lames, niggas bad aim<br/>
Thanks to a little change I tore you out the game<br/>
Bullet wounds will stop your bafoonery<br/>
Thanks to the pastor rapping at your eulogy<br/>
To Lil Kim and them, you know the women friend<br/>
Who, carry the work cross state for a gentlemen<br/>
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers<br/>
And most importantly you, the customer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (Kanye West)]</i><br/>
The Roc Boys in the building tonight<br/>
Oh what a feeling, I'm feeling life<br/>
You don't even gotta bring ya paper out<br/>
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house<br/>
(We in the house, hou-, hou-)<br/>
The Roc Boys in the building tonight<br/>
Look at how I'm chilling, I'm killing this ice<br/>
You don't even gotta bring ya purses out<br/>
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house<br/>
(We in the house, hou-, hou-)<br/>
(We in the house, hou-, hou-, HEY)<br/>
<br/>
Let ya hair down baby, I just hit a score<br/>
Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore<br/>
Take what the Forbes figure, then figure more<br/>
Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw<br/>
Pick a time, lets pick apart some stores<br/>
Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours<br/>
I figure frauds never hit a lick before<br/>
So they don't know the feeling when them things get across<br/>
Put ya hand out the window, feel the force<br/>
Feel the Porsche, hit the frost<br/>
Ice cold, jewels got no flaws<br/>
Drop got no top, you on the top floor<br/>
Pink Rosay, think OJ<br/>
I get away with murder when I sling yay<br/>
Niggas got less steps then Britney<br/>
That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (with overlapping 3rd verse towards end)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Red Porsches, rare portraits<br/>
Red glocks if you dare come near the fortress<br/>
This apple sauce is from the apple orchid<br/>
This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses<br/>
Which means I get it from the ground<br/>
Which means you get it when I'm around<br/>
Rich niggas, black bar mitzvahs<br/>
Mazel tav, it's a celebration bitches, la heim<br/>
I wish for you a hundred years of success but it's my time<br/>
Cheers, toast to crime<br/>
Number one b-boy, chain nigga rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Sweet, let that ride out!<br/>
Bring the horns back in, yeah<br/>
This is black super hero music right here baby<br/>
American Gangsta<br/>
Taking flight, coming to a town near you<br/>
Soon as I touch down I just want ya'll to start playing the horns like...<br/>
Hovies home...Lukey baby<br/>
Hahahahaha...ow!
