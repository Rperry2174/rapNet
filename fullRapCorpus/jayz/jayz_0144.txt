<i>[Notorious B.I.G. interview]</i><br/>
I'm just, tryin to stay above water y'know<br/>
Just stay busy, stay workin<br/>
Puff told me like, the key to this joint<br/>
The key to staying, on top of things<br/>
is treat everything like it's your first project, knahmsayin?<br/>
Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern<br/>
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, yes, yes<br/>
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop<br/>
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop<br/>
Let me tell you pe-eople why<br/>
Came from the bottom of the block I<br/>
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit<br/>
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch<br/>
Had to get my ri-ide on<br/>
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to<br/>
Had to had to get these chips<br/>
Had to make moves like Olajuwon<br/>
Started out sellin dimes and nicks<br/>
Graduated to a brick<br/>
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip<br/>
Legendary like a schoolboy<br/>
Crushin merely nearly every every chick<br/>
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped<br/>
And got left on some "Just +Me, Myself and I+"<br/>
On some Trugoy shit<br/>
Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return<br/>
Had to play with fire and get burned<br/>
Only way the boy ever gon' learn<br/>
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn<br/>
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's my life - it's my pain and my struggle<br/>
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing<br/>
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first<br/>
And my thirst is the same as - when I came<br/>
It's my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me<br/>
It's my ev-ery-thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Like I never rode in a limo<br/>
Like I just dropped flows to a demo<br/>
Like it's ninety-two again and<br/>
And I got O's in the rental<br/>
Back in the Stu' again, no prob' livin was a whole lot simpler<br/>
When you think back, you thought that<br/>
you would never make it this far, then you<br/>
take advantage of the luck you handed<br/>
Or the talent, you been given<br/>
Ain't no, half steppin, ain't no, no slippin<br/>
Ain't no different from a block that's hidden<br/>
Gotta get it while the getting's good<br/>
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, 'fore you stop<br/>
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance<br/>
Goodbye, this is my second major breakup<br/>
My first was, with a pager<br/>
With a hooptie, a cookpot, and the GAME<br/>
This one's with the stool, with the stage, with the fortune<br/>
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's my life - my pain and my struggle<br/>
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing<br/>
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first<br/>
And my thirst is the same as - when I came<br/>
It's my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me<br/>
It's my ev-ery-thing<br/>
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first<br/>
And my thirst like the first song I sang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Woo!  It's like the blues - we gon' ride out on this one<br/>
