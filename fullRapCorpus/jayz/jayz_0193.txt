<i>[Jay-Z Talking]</i><br/>
Thank you, thank you very much <br/>
For comin' out this evening<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you<br/>
You're far too kind<br/>
Hold you're applause <br/>
This is your song not mines<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you<br/>
Please hold your applause<br/>
For I just applied logic Keys keys open doors<br/>
Now I'm balcony, Opera, Black Tux, Binocula<br/>
Black luxe, Stop it I shouldn't be so popular<br/>
Name keep poppin' up Face keep poppin' up<br/>
On the tube I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up<br/>
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us<br/>
Sitting so close that we almost got snot on us<br/>
Please don't bow in my presence How am I a Legend?<br/>
I just got 10 #1 albums Maybe now 11<br/>
More hits than a Now! 11 <br/>
That is no reason to treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven<br/>
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes <br/>
Thank God, what a guy as I say my grace<br/>
Who woulda thought by making birds migrate <br/>
For the winter I be fly all summer Might I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Thank you, Thank you, thank you You're far too kind<br/>
Hold your applause This is your song not mines<br/>
Thank you, Thank you, thank you You're far too kind<br/>
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors I'll handle mines<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hovi Baby<br/>
We are really high, really high tonight<br/>
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars <br/>
To keep the ice cold, alright?<br/>
We the last guys to keep the Wise guys code alive<br/>
If I can't live by my word Then I'd much rather die<br/>
No no don't thank me, This is just how my suit is stitched<br/>
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits<br/>
For the Color Of Money like a Tom Cruise flick<br/>
'Cept I put 8-balls in corners without using pool sticks<br/>
Beautiful music when champagne flutes click<br/>
Beautiful women sippin' throught rouge lips<br/>
Dangers approaches We're like wait who's this?<br/>
Let us save you some trouble son<br/>
What size suit you is?<br/>
This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips<br/>
You can lay in your casket just as you is<br/>
We appreciate the target practices<br/>
We'll be sure to send flower baskets kid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I was gonna kill a couple rappers<br/>
But they did it to themselves<br/>
I was gon' do it with the flow<br/>
But they did it with their sales<br/>
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help<br/>
And they did a good job them boys is talented as hell<br/>
Cuz not only did they brick they put a building up as well<br/>
They ran a plane into that building and when that building fell<br/>
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled<br/>
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled<br/>
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar then took a smell<br/>
Cuz they heard that second hand smoke kills<br/>
Niggas thought they was ill found out they was...ILL<br/>
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We are really high, really high tonight<br/>
Lucky Lefty, kiss the wife tonight for me
