<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I work and work 'till I'm half-dead.<br/>
And I hear people saying, "She's getting old."<br/>
And what do I get? A daughter.<br/>
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her.<br/>
As she cares about me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Let's do this for these babies<br/>
Mercedes truck, fuck<br/>
Houses on acres<br/>
Blatantly ballin' on HD<br/>
Y'all need to step up y'all AV<br/>
Life changed again I was already taking off<br/>
My flight changed again<br/>
Slight change of winds<br/>
It's barely 12 noon<br/>
And my wife changed again<br/>
Baby needs Pampers<br/>
Daddy needs at least three weeks in the Hamptons<br/>
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block<br/>
I thought my daddy didn't love me<br/>
My baby getting chubby<br/>
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww isn't she lovely<br/>
Now I'm staring at praying that things don't get ugly<br/>
And I'm stuck in that old cycle<br/>
Like wife leaves hubby<br/>
Fuck joint custody<br/>
I need a joint right now<br/>
Just the thought alone fucks with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
High on life<br/>
I could die from the fall<br/>
Imagine if I hit the floor<br/>
Apologies in order<br/>
To Blue Ivy my daughter<br/>
If it was up to me<br/>
You would be with me<br/>
Sort of like daddy dearest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I dream filthy (my mom and pops) mixed me with Jamaican<br/>
(Rum and whiskey) what a set off (What a set off)<br/>
And I know I'm not perfect baby<br/>
I been through so much trauma<br/>
It gonna be hard to reverse it<br/>
With some doctors and some nurses maybe<br/>
Teach me on how to treat a lady<br/>
Open doors on the 'Cedes<br/>
This relationship shit is complicated<br/>
All I know is we ain't speaking everyday<br/>
I fucking hate it<br/>
I don't wanna duplicate it<br/>
I seen my mom and pop drive each other motherfuckin' crazy<br/>
And I got that nigga blood in me<br/>
I got his ego and his temper<br/>
All is missing is the drugs in me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Father never taught me how to be a father<br/>
Treated mother I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another<br/>
Baby with no daddy want no mama drama I just wanna<br/>
Take her back to a time when<br/>
Everything was calmer<br/>
Out in Paris on a terrace<br/>
Watching the Eiffel Tower<br/>
And a Ferris wheel yet and still<br/>
Nothing could prepare us<br/>
For the beauty that you be Blue be<br/>
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror<br/>
Have to face my fears<br/>
Cheer up<br/>
Why could you just be happy<br/>
Without these back and forth thoughts<br/>
You too much like your daddy<br/>
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him<br/>
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him<br/>
Now I got my own daughter<br/>
Taught her how to take her first steps<br/>
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath<br/>
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared<br/>
But in life and death<br/>
If I isn't there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
