<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Everything ain't hardcore you know<br/>
I can't sing but my man<br/>
I'ma let my man smooth that thang out for you<br/>
You know, take the edge off, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
All my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high<br/>
And all my real playas throw ya hands up high<br/>
And just keep on bouncin' while I take you on a ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
It's like your body's on radio I'm feelin' you in stereo<br/>
Put me in your cd player I'm gonna hit it nice and slow<br/>
Baby I'm your hot mix bumpin' in your cherry Lex<br/>
Checkin' out your widescreen while your hands up on the headrest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
I'm, in the studio thinkin' about my next hit song<br/>
Tryin' to come up with a melody that will turn you on<br/>
On the MPC3000 tryin' to come up with beats<br/>
That'll make come on over here and lay down here with me<br/>
I'm searchin' for that special mind blowin' melody<br/>
And it's gotta be sexy so I'll think it through carefully<br/>
It's like I'm tryin' to tune it, to ya station babe<br/>
Try to get you to play, this record babe<br/>
Every time I hear this track girl I think about me and you<br/>
In the Maybach doin' what we do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Um, now I know a few friends of mine that has made love to this record<br/>
So when you're in the mood call the station, request this record<br/>
She walks in the room, says "'Ly I can't breathe"<br/>
As I try to catch my breath and proceed<br/>
Lookin' at yo' sexy smile, while I put my vocals down<br/>
Girl you have made this song a hit in each and every town<br/>
You a sexy melody with a touch of freakin' harmony<br/>
Such a perfect chemistry<br/>
Girl we deserve a Grammy, or Soul Train<br/>
Billboard, MTV or BET award<br/>
Rollin' like we on a tour<br/>
Ooh the way you put it down girl I can't take it<br/>
Sex was so good girl we've got to do the remix<br/>
'Cause girl you a mix master<br/>
When it comes to pumpin' you such a ghetto blaster<br/>
It's such a hit that I gotta bootleg it, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
A melody is the chemistry, the way we click<br/>
It's like four part harmony and all that shit<br/>
Your waistline is the bassline, I ride that shit<br/>
Strung off your treble and I'm high as shit<br/>
We made love in the studio when we got together over and over again like a loop<br/>
Damn I'm missin' you, it's hard to listen to<br/>
all these different dudes, huggin' and kissin' you, fuck!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm feelin' you in stereo<br/>
Aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah
