And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>

Everything you love<br/>

<br/>
Uh-<br/>
She wants that old thing back<br/>
Uh- uh- uh-<br/>
She want those Heroin tracks<br/>
She likes me<br/>
She fiends for me nightly<br/>
She leans for me<br/>
Morning she rush for my touch<br/>
This is about LUST<br/>
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her<br/>
My presence is a must- must- must-<br/>
Bonita Applebum, i gotta put you on<br/>
If i didn't when we cuttin' the feeling would be too strong<br/>
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams<br/>
That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing<br/>
That Black Rain that take away your pain<br/>
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein<br/>
Now that feelin' got you trippin'<br/>
You no wanna feel no differently<br/>
Said lust has got you itchin'<br/>
Nose wide open and its' drippin' -eh -eh -eh -eh<br/>
I know what you like, i am your prescription<br/>
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction<br/>
<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
I know what you like<br/>
Everything you love<br/>
I know what you like<br/>
Everything you love<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
I know what you like ....HOV<br/>
Baby you love ....HOV<br/>
Baby you love ....HOV<br/>
Baby you like ....HOV<br/>
<br/>
I am so DOPE<br/>
Like Louboutin's with the red bottoms<br/>
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em<br/>
Like every color Giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me<br/>
Its so much fun, you shun therapy<br/>
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting<br/>
Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it<br/>
I'm never around, you constantly seek it<br/>
You'll never be down, i know where your peak is<br/>
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps<br/>
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself<br/>
Now your conscience is interfering, like "Better yourself!"<br/>
Like you better get help<br/>
But when that medicine's felt?<br/>
We're back together<br/>
Don't ever leave me<br/>
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me<br/>
My China White, 'til we D.O.A.<br/>
Its Montego forever, baby, lets get away....<br/>
<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
I know what you like<br/>
Everything you love<br/>
I know what you like<br/>
Everything you love<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
I know what you like ....HOV<br/>
Baby you love ....HOV<br/>
Baby you love ....HOV<br/>
Baby you like ....HOV<br/>
<br/>
How could you leave me?<br/>
I thought that you needed me!<br/>
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me--<br/>
Who helped you immediately?<br/>
How speedy of me!<br/>
How could you deny me so vehemently?<br/>
Now your body is shakin' trying to free it of me<br/>
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me<br/>
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me<br/>
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D<br/>
<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
I know what you like<br/>
Everything you love<br/>
I know what you like<br/>
Everything you love<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
And I Know And I Know<br/>
I know what you like ....HOV<br/>
Baby you love ....HOV<br/>
Baby you love ....HOV<br/>
Baby you like ....HOV
