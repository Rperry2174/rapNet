Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back<br/>
Liver bad he wouldn't live long, they snatched my dad back<br/>
Guidance I never had that, streets was my second home<br/>
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at<br/>
A place to study math at, matter fact I learned it all<br/>
Burnt it all this music is where I bury the ashes at<br/>
Flash back not having much, not having that<br/>
Had to get some hollerest you can holla back at<br/>
Holla that my Jewish lawyer do enjoy the fruit of within my cash stack<br/>
Just in case a nigga got to use his rat-ta-ta-ta-tat<br/>
Own boss own yawt, masters, slave<br/>
The mentality I carry with me to this very day<br/>
Fuck rich let's get wealthy who else gonna feed we<br/>
If I need it I'm gonna get it however God help me<br/>
<br/>
(And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm so for sure is known for sure<br/>
Stay out of trouble, momma said as momma sighs<br/>
Her fear her youngest son being victim of homocide<br/>
But I got to get you out of here momma or I'm gonna -- die<br/>
Inside -- and either way you lose me momma so let loose of me<br/>
I got the rain our direction'll soon change<br/>
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game<br/>
Hustle cane, hustle clothes or hustle music<br/>
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick<br/>
Skinny nigga toothpick but, but I do lift<br/>
Weight like I'm using roids Rolls Royce<br/>
Keep my movements smooth while maneuvering<br/>
Through all the manuers in the sewers that I grew up in<br/>
Choices we make trying to escape<br/>
<br/>
(And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!)<br/>
<br/>
This is not for commercial usage<br/>
Please don't categorize this is music<br/>
Please don't compare me to other rappers<br/>
Compare me to trappers I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris<br/>
And Luda's my dude I ain't trying to diss<br/>
Like Frank Lucas is cool but I ain't trying to snitch<br/>
I'm gonna follow the rules no matter how much time I'm gonna get<br/>
I'm gonna live and die with the decisions that I'm gonna pick<br/>
So fuck the haven for cave in, that's why we don't speak<br/>
Made men ain't supposed to make statements<br/>
End of the story I followed the code cracked the safe<br/>
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate<br/>
Leave that boy Hov alone why don't you<br/>
You don't have to if you don't want to but don't say I didn't warn you<br/>
<br/>
Oh (And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!)
