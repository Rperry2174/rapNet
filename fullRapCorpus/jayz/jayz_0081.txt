<i>[UNTIL THE ALBUM'S RELEASE only this single is being accepted]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, put our hands together for the astonishing...<br/>
<i>[girls singing]</i><br/>
H to the izz-O...V to the izz-A...<br/>
<br/>
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world<br/>
The flow o' the century...oh it's timeless...HOVE!<br/>
Thanks for comin' out tonight<br/>
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me<br/>
I appreciate that...uuunnnh...<br/>
<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA<br/>
Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins<br/>
Got it dirt cheap for them<br/>
Plus if they was short wit' cheese I would work wit' them<br/>
Boy and we...got rid of that dirt for them<br/>
Wasn't born hustlers I was burpin' em<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy<br/>
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me<br/>
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy<br/>
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in<br/>
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me<br/>
Therefore he doesn't exist<br/>
So poof...vamoose son of a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Not guilty ya'll got-ta feel me<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands UP!<br/>
<br/>
Holla at me...<br/>
I do this for my culture<br/>
To let 'em know what a nigga look like...when a nigga in a roaster<br/>
Show 'em how to move in a room full 'o vultures<br/>
Industry shady it need to be taken over<br/>
Label owners hate me I'm raisin' the status quo up<br/>
I'm overchargin' niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush<br/>
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hold us<br/>
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
Hove is back, life stories told through rap<br/>
Niggaz actin' like I sold you crack<br/>
Like I told you sell drugs...no...<br/>
Hove did that so hopefully you won't have to go through that<br/>
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats<br/>
Smokers out back, sellin' they mama's sofa<br/>
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave<br/>
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk<br/>
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?<br/>
Cracks in my palm, watchin' the long arm o' the law<br/>
So you know I seen it all before<br/>
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight<br/>
To try and to fail, the two things I hate<br/>
Succeed in this rap game, the two things is great<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
What else can I say about dude, I gets bizzay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[girls singing]</i><br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A... <i>[4x to fade out]</i>
