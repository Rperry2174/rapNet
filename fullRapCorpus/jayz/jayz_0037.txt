<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What?  Well fuck you... bitch<br/>

Bounce wit me, wit me, wit me wit me<br/>

<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
<br/>
Can I hit in the MORNIN<br/>
without givin you half of my dough<br/>
And even worse if I was broke would you WANT ME?<br/>
If I couldn't get you finer things<br/>
like all of them diamond rings bitches KILL FOR<br/>
would you STILL ROLL?<br/>
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand<br/>
would you RIDE THEN, if I wasn't DRIVIN?<br/>
If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga<br/>
would you come around me or would you clown me?<br/>
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya<br/>
put your two lips on my wood and kiss it - could ya<br/>
see yourself with a nigga workin harder than 9 to 5<br/>
contend with six, two jobs to survive, or<br/>
do you need a BALLA?  So you can shop and tear the MALL UP?<br/>
Brag, tell your friends what I BOUGHT YA<br/>
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low<br/>
Baby girl, if this is so, yo..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Can I get a FUCK YOU<br/>
to these bitches from all of my niggaz<br/>
who don't love hoes, they get no dough<br/>
<i>[Amil]</i> Can I get a WOOP WOOP<br/>
to these niggaz from all of my bitches<br/>

<i>[Verse Two: Amil]</i><br/>
<br/>
You ain't gotta be rich but FUCK THAT<br/>
How we gonna get around your BUS PASS<br/>
Fo' I put this pussy on your mustache<br/>
Can you AFFORD ME, my niggaz breadwinners, never corny<br/>
Ambition makes me, so horny<br/>
Not the fussin and the frontin<br/>
If you got nuttin, baby boy, you betta<br/>
"Git Up, Git Out and get somethin"  Shit!<br/>
I like a, lot of P-rada, Alize and Vodka<br/>
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up<br/>
Get it up I put it down erytime it pop up, huh<br/>
I got to snap em, let it loose, then I knock ya<br/>
Feel the juice, then I got ya, when you produce a rocka<br/>
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa<br/>
My, coochie remains in a Gucci name<br/>
Never test my patience nigga, I'm high maintenance<br/>
HIGH CLASS, if you ain't rollin, bypass<br/>
If you ain't holdin, I dash yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Now can you bounce for me, bounce for me<br/>
<i>[Ja]</i> Uhh<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Ja]</i> Uhh!<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Ja]</i> UHH!<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Gi-gi-gi-gi can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
<i>[Ja]</i> Uhh!  Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Ja (Rule)]</i><br/>
<br/>
It ain't even a question<br/>
how my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes<br/>
Like my bush wet and undry like damp clothes<br/>
What y'all niggaz don't know, it's eazy, to pimp a hoe<br/>
Bitches betta have my, money fo' sho'<br/>
Before they go, runnin they mouth, promotin half<br/>
I be dickin they, back out, go 'head, let it out<br/>
I fucks with my gat out, bounce and leave a hundred<br/>
Makin em feel, slutted even if they don't want it<br/>
It's been SO LONG<br/>
since I met a chick ain't on my tips but then I'm<br/>
DEAD WRONG, when I tell em BE GONE<br/>
So HOLD ON to the feelin of flossin and platinum<br/>
cause from NOW ON, you can witness Ja the I-CON<br/>
with hoodies and TIMBS ON, cause I thugs my bitches<br/>
VeVe, studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggaz<br/>
I'm talkin bout straight figures if you here, you wit us<br/>
If not Boo, you know what, I still fucked you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Now can you bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Wit me wit me wit me bounce wit me, bounce wit me<br/>
Bounce, bitch, bounce.. wit me wit me wit me wit me<br/>
