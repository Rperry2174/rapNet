<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
No, no, no, nope<br/>
You can't see 'em<br/>
Though you got plans to be him<br/>
Pay homage if by chance you meet him<br/>
In his pants pocket, your advance in pedium<br/>
It's the undisputed champ, being<br/>
For clique, dough sick, no medicine for us<br/>
Competition like I said in the chorus<br/>
Let me spell it out for ya<br/>
Jay to tha Amil<br/>
(A to the Y stay real fuck how they feel, uh-huh, uh-huh)<br/>
That's how we put it down<br/>
(Uh-huh, uh-huh y'all gon get it now)<br/>
Chip off the old block<br/>
Resemble my old pops<br/>
'Cept I tote glocks and open dope spots<br/>
And I shut down rap crews<br/>
Smack them cats who flash tools<br/>
Laugh at fake ballers with bad jewels<br/>
I'll tell you once<br/>
This is shit you should've of knew<br/>
(Jigga what?)<br/>
Jigga<br/>
(Jigga who?)<br/>
Okay<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
No, no, no<br/>
I'mma Roc-a-fella soldier<br/>
I thought I told ya<br/>
Hustler, nigga move weight like Oprah<br/>
Drive wide body, twenty-inch big motor<br/>
No tints, make no mistake y'all it's Hova<br/>
I stay sportin' played Jordan's before Jordan<br/>
Verses tight, hooks harder than Ken Norton<br/>
Musically touching you<br/>
Truthfully I abuse beats better call BCW<br/>
I make my mother move<br/>
So I have no problem coming around the old way<br/>
Sluggin' you, that's what a thug will do<br/>
(Thuggin', bust techs, a suspect dangerous, and I love rough sex)<br/>
Yeah that's what's up<br/>
Even when I'm asleep the gats is up<br/>
Paranoid like Sunny drive backing up<br/>
But I'm from Bed-Stuy, killa with the flow<br/>
Let lead fly from out the four-four, motherfuckers<br/>
<br/>

Competition is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
No, no, no<br/>
None I remain at the top like the sun<br/>
And I burn whoever come in my chambers of torture<br/>
The flame gon' spark ya<br/>
Blood stain the tarp<br/>
But remains they chalk ya<br/>
Don't try to smooth talk us<br/>
<i>[Amil (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
You got nothing to offer<br/>
But the baby nine<br/>
And make ya fine offer<br/>
The chick is ill<br/>
Even with four-inch heels<br/>
No panties on and Patricia Fields<br/>
I get down<br/>
Just name the time, the place<br/>
We could take it back to Vaseline on our face<br/>
On a regular day we just gleam up your space<br/>
Rock our own line, got our whole team laced<br/>
RW with the torch on my jeans by the waist<br/>
Without heat we still gon steam up the place<br/>
(Amil-lion, Jigga man, flawless, here we go)<br/>
