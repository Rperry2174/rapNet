<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Fellas, a few tips, when you're in the club<br/>
You must watch your girl, because she may end up with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
TrackMasters (uhh... turn the music up)<br/>
Rock Land<br/>
Hova (woo! yess, yess)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Now somebody's girl is in my mansion<br/>
Shakin that ass to this<br/>
And somebody's girl is in my hot tub<br/>
Drinkin that glass of Crist'<br/>
And somebody's girl is in my bedroom<br/>
And man she's a superfreak<br/>
And somebody's girl is leavin my crib<br/>
Now on to the next booty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Ummmmmmmmm, I don't mean no harm<br/>
But your boy got the magic stick, the Don Juan<br/>
Bishop, chicks'll dissapear in thin air<br/>
like mist or some shit like this I swear<br/>
I take handcuffs off misses, I pick locks wicked<br/>
I catch your eye cause my tick-tock's frigid<br/>
My necklace glisten, all reckless chicks is<br/>
eyeballin, yeah, and I caught 'em like perfect pitches<br/>
Call me Mike Piazza<br/>
Once I get 'em in, my fly casa<br/>
It's hot tubs, heated pools and no rules<br/>
Call your old dude and tell him he old news<br/>
Tell that fella you feel like Cinderella<br/>
With both shoes and it's almost two<br/>
Fuck a storybook endin, we bendin the rules<br/>
This is somebody's girl part two, now move<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Uhh, let me at it<br/>
Somebody's girl is sittin in my lap<br/>
Whisper two words and we both break out<br/>
My Maybach seats is just as big as a couch<br/>
Not the same girl now that the mic's at your mouth<br/>
Oh that's gettin nasty, let's get naughty<br/>
Rollin around like a fo'-wheel afterparty<br/>
We stop at a red light, there go your girls an' 'em<br/>
Now we got the green light, driver follow them (let's go)<br/>
You're rotatin with a guy that spend money like the world spin 'round<br/>
First guy to ever put the singin rap down<br/>
Say the name Kels and these chicks spellbound<br/>
Because these chicks know I put the "12Play" down<br/>
I gotta have it, I just can't stop limpin<br/>
Maybe because I just can't stop pimpin<br/>
No matter what I do, I can't stop leanin<br/>
When the fresh Prada's on and the sun is shinin<br/>
Girls it's your boyfriend<br/>
With that remix that keeps you clubbin<br/>
Dis collabo' crack got you fiendin<br/>
The industry kings and the rest is dreamin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
The moral of the tale, if you love your tail<br/>
Treat her well, keep her 'way from Hov' and Kel'<br/>
Because we can't stop pimpin<br/>
We put it on her 'til she can't stop limpin<br/>
She'll be a goner, you can play tough guy on the corner<br/>
I smoothe her out in the sauna<br/>
Yeah, I blew it out in the Bahamas, yeah<br/>
Your lil' mama got a stellar arm<br/>
We got it on like a telethon<br/>
Mr. Roc-A-Fella, gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
