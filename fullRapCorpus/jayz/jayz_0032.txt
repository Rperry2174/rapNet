I'm rollin with Roc-a-Fella man<br/>
Cause they got money man, heh heh<br/>
<br/>
Uh-huh, uh-huh uh UH, uh-huh, 'Hovah<br/>
Yeah, Stevie J nigga<br/>
Y'all ready? Yo, yo<br/>
<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight)<br/>
How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight)<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight<br/>
Nigga ride or die or ride or die<br/>
<i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo fuck y'all, niggaz I crush y'all, rush y'all<br/>
with the four drawn and I touch y'all, plus y'all<br/>
little motherfuckers ain't ready for war<br/>
I seen your team in a Chrysler before, but I forgot?<br/>
The same rules apply, don't try to switch up your style<br/>
Y'all niggaz is pumpkin pie, and that's plain as I<br/>
much better than you cat, shocked when I got the news that<br/>
this nigga ready for war, well where that fool at?<br/>
I bruise wack rap niggaz severely punish them<br/>
Especially those that get fucked for they publishing, heh<br/>
Always gotta be the weakest nigga out the crew<br/>
I probably make more money off yo' album, than you<br/>
You see the respect I get everytime I come through<br/>
Check your own videos, you'll always be number two<br/>
Niggaz talkin real greasy on them R&amp;B records<br/>
but I'm platinum a million times nigga, check the credits<br/>
S. Carter, ghost writer, and for the right price<br/>
I can even make YO' shit tighter<br/>
I roast niggaz like ya, smoke niggaz like ya<br/>
Take your little jewels and put the toast to niggaz like ya<br/>
You know what the fuck we do and why we done it<br/>
How I bring it to niggaz who, probably want it<br/>
Keep playin, you gon' find me in your lobby blunted<br/>
And I don't even smoke nigga, ain't no joke<br/>
Niggaz cat fightin with Jigga, kickin sneaky shit<br/>
Makin little tapes but keepin it secret<br/>
Cause I kick that deep shit that divide your peeps shit<br/>
Now I don't know if you fuckin with Jigga<br/>
spittin that weak shit y'all<br/>
<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight)<br/>
How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight)<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight<br/>
Nigga ride or die or ride or die<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Niggaz don't want it with Jig, cause somethin got to give<br/>
I got homes where you hide, I hustle where you live<br/>
Jigga's the Don, bitches scream "Jigga dandy,<br/>
dick is the bomb, about as thick as a arm"<br/>
Mr. Exxon, gas 'em with the wit and the charm<br/>
Bitch I'm tryin to tell you like Nichalous Bond<br/>
I'm a big cat, listen mami, can you dig that?<br/>
Cars, jewelry, homes, I did that<br/>
Oh's, shootouts, keys, I live that<br/>
Actresses, models, chickenheads, hit that<br/>
I get stacks and still I kick back<br/>
and run up on niggaz with the midac, where the shit at?<br/>
<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight)<br/>
How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight)<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight<br/>
Nigga ride or die or ride or die<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Time to seperate<br/>
the platinum from the white gold, right from the door<br/>
The real from the fake, ready rock from the raw<br/>
The boss from the runners, cats who ride dick<br/>
from the cats with the numbers, the five from the six<br/>
I got cop n crash money, pop the dash money<br/>
Press the button, alluva sudden, glock in the stash money<br/>
Beef with Jigga, watch yo' ass Money<br/>
It's El Presidente, top brass money<br/>
Now I don't flash the steel, I blast for real<br/>
My motto: you only good as the last nigga you kill<br/>
I'm here to snatch this meal, nigga that's for real<br/>
If you rollin with me grab the wheel, let's ride huh?<br/>
<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight (ride tonight)<br/>
How many y'all down to die tonight (die tonight)<br/>
How many y'all wanna ride tonight<br/>
Nigga ride or die or ride or die<br/>
<i>[repeat 4X]</i>
