("Never, never, never, never change")<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I am a, Roc representer<br/>
Hov', summer to winter, Hov', dead or alive<br/>
Twenty-four/seven, three-sixty-five<br/>
One CD or three-hundred and sixty pies<br/>
Whassup to E and Kirk?  Welcome home to Taj<br/>
Let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours<br/>
We run streets like drunks run street lights<br/>
We collidin with life as we speak<br/>
We knee deep in coke, we ki deep in ice<br/>
We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke<br/>
We all fish, better teach your folk<br/>
Give him money to eat, then next week he's broke<br/>
Cause when you sleep, he's reachin for your throat<br/>
Word on the skreet, you reap what you sew<br/>
Not out of fear but love, love for the game<br/>
Roc family first, we never change mayn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
("Never, never, never, never change")<br/>
I'm still fuckin with crime cause crime pays<br/>
("I never change!")<br/>
Out hustlin, same clothes for days<br/>
("I never change!")<br/>
I never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I never change<br/>
Who you know like Hov'?<br/>
("Never, never, never, never change")<br/>
I'm still fuckin with crime cause crime pays<br/>
("I never change!")<br/>
Out hustlin, same clothes for days<br/>
("I never change!")<br/>
I never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I never change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What's up to my Miami and St. Thomas connects (whattup)<br/>
I'll never mention your name, I promise respect<br/>
Death before dishonor correct? - Yup<br/>
That's what you promised me, since the (?)lee<br/>
Along with, if we stay strong<br/>
We can get paper longer than Pippen's arms<br/>
Plead the fifth when it comes to the fam<br/>
I'm like a dog - I never speak, but I understand<br/>
Where my dogs at?  Where my soldiers at war?<br/>
Where your bars at?  Whoa, gotta pause that - whoa<br/>
Lost 92 bricks had to fall back<br/>
Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back<br/>
Had A-1 credit, got more crack<br/>
From the first to the fifth, gave it all back<br/>
If, I'm not a hustler what you call that?<br/>
This is before rap, this is all fact<br/>
I never change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What, the streets robbed me, wasn't educated properly<br/>
Well fuck y'all, I needed money for Atari<br/>
Was so young my big sis' still playin with Barbie<br/>
Young brother, big city, eight million stories<br/>
Old heads taught me, yung'un, walk softly<br/>
Carry a big clip, that'll get niggaz off me<br/>
Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin mothy<br/>
Change is cool to cop but more important is lawyer fees<br/>
(Uhh) That's how it is now (uhh) that's how it always be<br/>
(Uhh) I never change, this is always me<br/>
From the womb to the tomb, from now until my doom<br/>
Drink army from one cup pass it around the room (That's a family nigga)<br/>
That's the ritual (yup) Big Ran, I ain't forget you fool<br/>
And all that bullshit you tryin to get through<br/>
This is crew love, move music or move drugs<br/>
Rival crews get your black suits up - I never change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This is Jay, everyday<br/>
Who you know like Hov', nigga?
