<i>[Intro/Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm what the game made me<br/>
Not what the fame made me<br/>
No amount of money can change me<br/>
I'm what you lames can't be<br/>
Live nigga what? Live as fuck<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Check, live from the 7-1-8<br/>
Either respect the flow or learn your lesson from your weight<br/>
I'm wishin arthritis on all writers who, Knock My Hustle<br/>
How can y'all understand the struggle?<br/>
It's hard to live, when you got greedy niggaz in the mix<br/>
Knowin I outclass three-E niggaz in the six<br/>
So I outblast til it's empty clips<br/>
And I outlast niggaz, survival of the fit<br/>
One life, I gotta make sure it's done right<br/>
Cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation<br/>
Ball out, until I fall out<br/>
Stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out<br/>
Hard to think about your future with, nothin to gain<br/>
Hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain<br/>
Life's harsh, I know y'all runnin from 'caine<br/>
but it'll only catch you and track you down<br/>
With no deal, who you gonna rap to now?<br/>
Start your own record company, that's profound<br/>
Live niggaz gonna rumble when you back from the war<br/>
Jive niggaz gonna crumble and fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Aiyyo whether in the Pinto, or rollin in the six<br/>
I come through cocky, holdin my dick<br/>
I never switch shit, cause that's some bitch shit<br/>
I get the Bisquick take it to the district<br/>
cause I could never get rich, and switch my style<br/>
I just cop a little hurt, to the mercantile<br/>
I'm tryin to get it though, rhymin with this six digit flow<br/>
Gettin fly is the minimal, holdin somethin is the principal<br/>
Respect this young nigga that's, holdin the torch<br/>
Preachin shit like the crack game, don't take shorts<br/>
Throw it down it's a bet, nigga roll hard<br/>
til you got somethin icey, round your neck<br/>
In this concrete jungle get rich or remain humble<br/>
Never speak the biz, at worst I might mumble<br/>
Niggaz test it I spit guns, angrily<br/>
Til all that remains is me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (by Memphis Bleek instead of Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Sauce Money]</i><br/>
I went from no dough to show dough to money to blow<br/>
From umm, hoe I don't know, to get deez<br/>
Never, "Excuse me miss," bitch please, never try to provoke<br/>
Same disrespectful cat I was when I was broke<br/>
Ain't nuttin changed baby but the different faces I stop<br/>
or maybe some of the places I shop<br/>
Now that I run through tracks like cleets with a Air<br/>
for some of the hottest beats, still catch me eatin at Pete's<br/>
Fuck the foul cat who screamed out and threatened my life<br/>
It's all good, here I come kid, dead to the hood<br/>
til I'm in the dirt, foul cats like termites<br/>
come out of the woodworks, if they think you stack paper<br/>
Dead niggaz react later while the cancer spread<br/>
Teach a team how to scheme before they answer lead<br/>
You know me, I used to shoot hoops in the park, ain't nothin changed<br/>
except now I push Coupe's in the dark<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Sauce Money instead of Jay-Z)]</i>
