<i>[Intro - Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Yeah, see it's that<br/>
It's that Blueprint 3 shit right here<br/>
It's that TM 103 shit right here<br/>
You ready? You ready Hov'? Let's go! (Hands up!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Allow me to re-introduce myself<br/>
At the same time re-introduce my wealth<br/>
At the same time rejuvenate the game<br/>
It's for my ol'dawg niggas that's used to 'caine<br/>
<br/>
Not what B-dawg said, I respect the game<br/>
GD's, vice lords, crips the same<br/>
And I know you're 'bout to say this off the chain<br/>
Tell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane<br/>
<br/>
See I ain't dead or in jail, I can't complain<br/>
And when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain<br/>
And if you just tunin' in, let me explain<br/>
You know I keep that 47 who ??<br/>
<br/>
These niggas way too far, I played the game<br/>
And if you listen hard enough I say some things<br/>
And when that sack got low, I shave them things<br/>
And put 'em right back together, I made them things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click<br/>
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby<br/>
Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch<br/>
Say you looking for the real, hey well this is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Wassup, wassup <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I got it Jeezy<br/>
<br/>
Now where the south side at, wassup, wassup<br/>
Where the west coast at, put your W's up<br/>
Where my east coast niggas that hustle to live<br/>
And all my niggas up north that's doin' it big<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah I'm rare, I'm aware that I'm rare<br/>
I rap and I'm real, I'm one of the few here<br/>
These other boys lyin', I wonder if y'all care<br/>
They stories out this world, I wonder if y'all hear<br/>
<br/>
But don't really matter as long as they stay clear<br/>
Clear of the real shit we doin' over here<br/>
When my nigga get home, I'm gonna send him a Lear<br/>
For all the time he been down, get him right up in the air<br/>
<br/>
With a couple of broads get him right up in the air<br/>
Mile high club get him right up in there<br/>
Send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year<br/>
By the time you hear this song, he'll be standing right here<br/>
<br/>
Real nigga shit there!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click<br/>
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby<br/>
Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch<br/>
Say you looking for the real, hey well this is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]</i><br/>
A hundred million to the good and I'm still talkin' yayo<br/>
At a snails pace I won this race that y'all trail<br/>
Uh, uh, Blueprint's for sale<br/>
Followin' my footprints you can't fail<br/>
<br/>
Set sail, I used to duck shots but now I eat quail<br/>
I'll probably never see jail<br/>
Each tale contains more of the truth<br/>
Of the statue allows me to go into detail<br/>
<br/>
Uh, close your eyes you can smell<br/>
Hov's the audio equivalent of braille<br/>
That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil<br/>
And water-house 'cause real recognize real<br/>
<br/>
Rrraaahhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
You know me, I don't need no introductions<br/>
Call me make a lil' somethin' out of nothin'<br/>
Anywhere you go, we're the topic of discussion<br/>
Damn, that's gotta be disgustin'<br/>
<br/>
Err, shit make me wanna throw up<br/>
It's big boy music, it should make me wanna grow up<br/>
Flows like selvage, it just make me wanna pour up<br/>
And is it just me or this makes you wanna roll up<br/>
<br/>
A big fat one, then unpack one<br/>
Then unwrap one, peel back one<br/>
They use to call me Jizzle when they stamp in the middle<br/>
And you can tell the color when it's damp in the middle<br/>
<br/>
Wassup!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click<br/>
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby<br/>
Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch<br/>
Say you looking for the real, hey well this is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is real as it gets<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is real as it gets
