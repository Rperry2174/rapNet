<i>[Intro: snippets of Eddie in "Super Fly"]</i><br/>
You know, you've got this.. fantasy in your head about<br/>
getting outta the life and, setting the corporate world on its ear<br/>
What the FUCK you gonna do except hustle?<br/>
Besides pimpin... you really ain't got the stomach for that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
The game's fucked up<br/>
Nigga's beats is banging, nigga your hooks did it<br/>
Your lyrics didn't and your gangster look did it<br/>
So I would write it if y'all could get it<br/>
Being intricate'll get you wood, critic<br/>
On the Internet, they like you should spit it<br/>
I'm like you should buy it, nigga that's good business<br/>
Hehe, forget this rap shit I need a new hustle<br/>
A little bit of everything, the new improved Russell<br/>
I say that reluctantly cause I do struggle<br/>
As you see I can't leave so I do love you<br/>
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper<br/>
In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper<br/>
Back when crack was<br/>
What these pills are, I was a real star<br/>
Complete with real, cars, no video ones<br/>
You can come and set up a camera, let the video run<br/>
And my real life, complete with real, ice<br/>
VVS boulders oh they're visibly set<br/>
Head and shoulders, my invisible neck<br/>
You see Hova, wasn't digital yet<br/>
Befo' Steve Jobs, made the iPod<br/>
Was getting head, jobs, we call that intimate<br/>
Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette<br/>
With a automatic weapon I was rapping with a tec<br/>
(Fresh) like (Mannie) be, chain like anti-freeze<br/>
Shoebox full of cash, dealer man hand me ki's<br/>
Pantries full of Arm &amp; Hammer, don't take Nancy Drew to see<br/>
what it do, I'm a damn G<br/>
Just sent a million dollars through a hands free<br/>
That's big money talk, can you answer me?<br/>
Before the answer was a 3<br/>
I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, lawyer chick<br/>
Sure he's rich now cause he saw the shit, all this shit<br/>
That's why they call him Hov', cause he came before all this shit<br/>
Bought a 6, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights<br/>
Bought a 9 for non-stop glock work all the time<br/>
Woo! Guess who's back?<br/>
Since this is a new era, got a fresh new hat<br/>
Ten year veteran, I've been set<br/>
I've been through with this bullshit game but I never quit<br/>
I used to think rapping at 38 was ill<br/>
But last year alone I grossed 38 mill'<br/>
I know I ain't quite 38 but still<br/>
The flow so (Special) got a (38) feel<br/>
The real is back, hehehehe
