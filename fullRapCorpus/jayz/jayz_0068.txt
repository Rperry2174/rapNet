<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Sup ma? You want to roll with us, y'knowhatI'msayin?<br/>
It's good, it's love, it's all love<br/>
We got cases of Belvedere, we gon' play truth or dare<br/>
We gon' really get to know one another<br/>
All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right<br/>
Knahmean? I'm here for you, yo<br/>
<br/>
Relax yourself, let your conscience be free<br/>
You now rollin with them thugs from the R-O-C<br/>
Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be<br/>
but in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game<br/>
Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot<br/>
The topic of discussion in every nail shop<br/>
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust<br/>
and within a week, watch your arm freeze up<br/>
Brassiere get right, A to a D cup<br/>
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up<br/>
Ears get iced, gear get spiced<br/>
From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life<br/>
Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell<br/>
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel<br/>
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well<br/>
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ singer]</i><br/>
<i>[J]</i> Get your mind right mami, get your mind right<br/>
You gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Get your mind right mami, get your mind right<br/>
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Get your mind right mami, get your mind right<br/>
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Get your mind right mami, get your mind right<br/>
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Yo, I'm young Memphis, used to play the apprentice<br/>
Now I'm like the teacher, c'mere, let me teach ya<br/>
how to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures<br/>
How to play it cool when police come to pinch us<br/>
Relax mami, let the Belvy flow<br/>
Inhale the 'dro, exhale it slow<br/>
I could teach you how to roll, teach you bout fly kicks<br/>
Teach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit<br/>
When the beeper goes off, please don't reach<br/>
like you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek<br/>
Get your mind right baby, goin through mine crazy<br/>
When I'm in the shower, *69 me crazy<br/>
Track my last call, contact my broad<br/>
with a bitch ?? had physical contact in the mall<br/>
You got issues {inhales} problems you need to iron out<br/>
I will, holla, for now you on time out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ singer and Snoop]</i><br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
P-I-M-P-ology<br/>
I played you and you paid me<br/>
Believe me when I tell you girl I know you a freak<br/>
for fuckin with me, that ain't all you can be<br/>
Just put your mind to it you can go real far<br/>
I know times gettin hard on the boulevard<br/>
They say, pimpin is dead; man, pimpin ain't dead<br/>
These hoes just scared and they blind tryin and dyin to be lead<br/>
But who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em<br/>
Get they mind right and feed 'em<br/>
Now I don't need 'em (uh uh) but I can do that there<br/>
Put on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple my hair<br/>
so I can, feel like a player when I walk in the place<br/>
Got yo' bitch all on my line and now she up in my face<br/>
Is this yo' bitch is that yo' bitch cause if she's not she mine<br/>
She fallin fo' a nigga and I ain't even dropped a line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ Snoop]</i><br/>
Get out my limelight bitch and get your mind right<br/>
C'mon little mama, c'mon<br/>
Get your mind right bitch, get your mind right<br/>
C'mon baby girl, c'mon, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
You gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Get your mind right mami, get your mind right<br/>
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me<br/>
<i>[J]</i> Get your mind right ma, get your mind right<br/>

<i>[J]</i> Got ta get your mind right baby, get your mind right<br/>
And I need gangsta girls for my gangsta family<br/>
