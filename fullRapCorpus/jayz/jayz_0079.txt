<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uh-huh uhh, uhh, uh-uhh<br/>
Uh-huh uhh, uhh, uhh<br/>
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!<br/>
I, am, back, niggaz<br/>
Ha ha ha ha ha.. uh-oh, uh-oh - whoo!<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen.. H, to the Izzo<br/>
I wanna thank everybody out there for they purchase<br/>
I surely appreciate it - whoo!<br/>
What you about to witness is my thoughts<br/>
Just my thoughts man - right or wrong<br/>
Just what I was feeling at the time, uhh<br/>
You ever felt like this, you vibe with me<br/>
Walk with a nigga man - just vibe with me<br/>
<br/>
Yo, gather round hustlers that's if you still livin<br/>
And get on down, to that ol' Jig rhythm<br/>
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison<br/>
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high<br/>
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people<br/>
Mouthpiece for hustlers I'm back motherfuckers<br/>
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns<br/>
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?<br/>
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm<br/>
Charges don't stick to dude he's teflon<br/>
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred<br/>
I'm not guilty, now GIMME back my bread<br/>
Mr. District Attorney I'm not sure if they told you<br/>
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to<br/>
plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight<br/>
Hov's a soldier, Hov' been fightin all his life so<br/>
What could you do to me?  It's not new to me<br/>
Sue me; fuck you - what's a couple dollars to me?<br/>
But you will respect me, simple as that<br/>
Or I got no problem goin back<br/>
I'm representin for the seat where Rosa Parks sat<br/>
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped<br/>
So off we go, let the trumpets blow<br/>
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro<br/>
The ruler's back<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, uh-huh uhh uhh<br/>
I, am, BACK, niggaz - whoo! whoo! whoo! whoo!<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Turn the motherfuckin music up<br/>
The ruler's back<br/>
I, am, back, niggaz<br/>
Yeah, geah, yeah, geah, yeah, geah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Well in these times, well at least to me<br/>
There's a lot of rappers out there tryin to sound like Jay-Z<br/>
I'll help you out, here's what you do<br/>
You gonna need a wide lens cause that's a VERR' big shoe<br/>
And you got a couple of +Beans+ and you don't have a +Clue+?<br/>
You situation is +Bleek+, I'ma keep it +Rell+ cause<br/>
Fuckin with me, you gotta drop +Amil+<br/>
Cause if you gonna cop somethin you gotta cop f'real<br/>
Don't only talk it, walk like it - from the Bricks to the booth<br/>
I can predict the future like Cleo the psychic<br/>
You can't date skee-os and wife it (uh-uh)<br/>
And you can't sell me bullshit, we know the prices<br/>
So what your life is?  We gon' roll<br/>
'til the wheels fall off, y'all muh'fuckers check the tires<br/>
Off we go, let the trumpets blow<br/>
And hold on, because the driver of that Bentley is a pro<br/>
The ruler's back<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, uhh<br/>
I, am, back, niggaz<br/>
Feels good!  Ha<br/>
Pah, holla at me!<br/>
The ruler's back<br/>
Yeah.. whoo!<br/>
Yeah.. yeah.. yeah..<br/>
<br/>
Now bounce, c'mon, bounce<br/>
Uhh, whoo! Whoo!<br/>
Bounce, c'mon, bounce<br/>
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yeah<br/>
Bounce, c'mon, bounce<br/>
Uhh, yeah, just my thoughts ladies and gentlemen<br/>
Just what I'm feelin at the time, you know what I mean?<br/>
Knahmean? <i>[music fades w/ ad libs]</i>
