Roc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, Swizz Beats<br/>
It's almost over y'all<br/>
Jigga, how real is that?<br/>
Uhh, uhh, uhh, lights out niggaz!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (and Amil)]</i><br/>
(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?<br/>
(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?<br/>
(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh<br/>
Niggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO? <br/>
(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?<br/>
(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?<br/>
(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh<br/>
Niggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah.. yeah..<br/>
From the crap tables down in A.C.<br/>
back on the block Jay-Z motherfucker from the, the, the Roc<br/>
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same<br/>
Brooklyn be the place where I serve them thangs<br/>
B. my niggaz was strugglin, to the 'burbs they came<br/>
And then we got to hustlin, murderin thangs<br/>
I dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain<br/>
Now I'm Titanic, Iceberg's the name<br/>
Leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game<br/>
The best way to describe me in a word, insane<br/>
I dick down chicks all emerged in my fame<br/>
Jigga been dope since Slick Rick's first chain<br/>
The God, send you back to the earth from which you came<br/>
I'm baking soda, waterfire, merged with 'cane<br/>
Ladies don't know me said, "I heard he's vain"<br/>
Well guess what mami? I heard the same<br/>
You heard the name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, uhh, I got a<br/>
license to kill so I stare at the gat<br/>
Roc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, niggaz scared of that<br/>
Got a new motto this year, "Don't Fuck With My Ones"<br/>
Knock on your door, three in the mornin, <br/>
"It's just us and the guns!"<br/>
See I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns<br/>
I got the, mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy<br/>
Niggaz get fly, let em defy gravity<br/>
Fo'-five rapidly lift your chest cavity<br/>
Streets won't let me chill<br/>
Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill<br/>
Muh'fuckers wanna wet me still, I remain y'all<br/>
more than one, like five divided by four<br/>
Shit, this just the hate that's been provided by y'all<br/>
Reciprocated and multiplied by more<br/>
You likely to see Jigga in a widebody or<br/>
drop-top Bentley Azure, holla at me y'all<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I don't give a fuck <br/>
if I sold one or one million, but I think you should<br/>
Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood<br/>
All black in the club, the outcome ain't good<br/>
Them niggaz act like wolves, how come? They could<br/>
Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash<br/>
Til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass<br/>
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash<br/>
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash<br/>
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass<br/>
All I gotta do is let em call me Shawn de'Glass<br/>
Let me sit up in they whip til I launch it back<br/>
Snap they neck, then shoot em til they arch them back<br/>
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat<br/>
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back<br/>
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that<br/>
And e'rybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon<br/>
Uh-huh uhh uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (and Amil)]</i><br/>
(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?<br/>
(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?<br/>
(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh<br/>
Niggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO? <br/>
(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?<br/>
(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?<br/>
(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh<br/>
Niggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO?<br/>
(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?<br/>
(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?<br/>
(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh<br/>
Niggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO? <br/>
(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?<br/>
(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?<br/>
(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh<br/>
Niggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right..<br/>
(Jigga) ...
