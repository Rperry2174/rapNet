<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Jay-Z, Hova,<br/>
Either love me or leave me alone <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi - Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh they want me to fall (fall),<br/>
Fall from the top (top),<br/>
They want me to drop (drop)<br/>
They want me to stop (stop)<br/>
They want me to go (go),<br/>
I'm already gone (already)<br/>
The shit that I'm on<br/>
I'm already home<br/>
(Hey, I'm already home yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
These nigga's want me to go, don't they know that I'm gone<br/>
They know I'm space shuttle level they need oxygen<br/>
Don't they know that they boring?<br/>
Don't they know that I yawn,<br/>
Only time they excited is when they mentioning Shawn<br/>
You see single white female but she dyed her hair blonde<br/>
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them<br/>
Somebody turn these boys off<br/>
don't they know that I'm on<br/>
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs<br/>
What the fuck are they Laurynnn, you Killing me softly<br/>
You talk me to death, only thing you can do to him<br/>
I open the door for them, what else can I do?<br/>
These nigga's want me to walk for them, somebody talk to them<br/>
Before I go off on them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I taught 'em about fish scale they want me to fish for them<br/>
They want me to catch clean, then cook up a dish for them<br/>
All of this just for them, or they got a diss for him<br/>
They want me to disappear, like it's gonna SHIFT for them<br/>
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit with them<br/>
But what they admitting is, they ain't got shit for him<br/>
But really the fact is, we not in the same bracket<br/>
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets<br/>
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches<br/>
So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing?<br/>
Nigga I been missing, nigga I been gone<br/>
The shit that you just witnessed is the shit that I been on<br/>
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it<br/>
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it<br/>
Now these nigga's is mad, oh they call me a Camel<br/>
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal<br/>
Half-man half-mammal<br/>
My sign is a Sag, this is just what I plan to do<br/>
Oh don't be mad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm in the hall already, on the wall already<br/>
I'm a work of art, I'm a Warhol already<br/>
On another level, on another plane already<br/>
H-O-V I got my own lane already (already)<br/>
I done cooked up the rock already<br/>
So why the fuck can't you all get hot already (already)<br/>
Put your name in the pot already, niggas compare me to Biggie and Pac already<br/>
Like I'm gone already and I am nigga I'm already home already<br/>
If you all can't already see I ain't worried about you all cos I'm already me<br/>
Do you already, enough of the complaining boohoos already<br/>
Eat food already, ain't nothing given you gotta claim your shoes already,<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, so in summation I don't know who you racing I'm already at the finish line with the flag waving - c'mon!
