<i>[Damian Marley &amp; Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Now greetings to the world<br/>
Gangsta no live in a tenement yard<br/>
Rude boy no live in a tenement yard<br/>
Too much watchy, watchy, watchy<br/>
Too much su, su, su, su, su<br/>
Them chatty, chatty, chatty<br/>
Them su, su, su, su, su<br/>
Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Shawn was on that gospel shit<br/>
I was on the total fuckin' opposite<br/>
Shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer<br/>
That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off<br/>
Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures<br/>
So when you get to Hell you tell 'em blanco sent you<br/>
I can't take no threats, I got a set of twins<br/>
Those were just the words you'll never hear again<br/>
For the final time you don't believe these fools<br/>
I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels<br/>
I've never seen the runner with so many cars<br/>
Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are<br/>
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas<br/>
Just set the price so niggas'll live your live, my nigga<br/>
Once upon a time in the projects<br/>
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex<br/>
I was in fight mode and now it's "fuck me, mijo"<br/>
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples<br/>
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools<br/>
Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too<br/>
Before we had A&amp;R's, we had AR's too<br/>
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do<br/>
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did<br/>
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid<br/>
Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6"<br/>
Got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget<br/>
Don't you never forget, Jigga got this shit poppin'<br/>
I pulled out the pot when we was outta options<br/>
<br/>

Gangsta no live in a tenement yard<br/>
Rude boy no live in a tenement yard<br/>
Too much watchy, watchy, watchy<br/>
Too much su, su, su, su, su<br/>
Them chatty, chatty, chatty<br/>
Them su, su, su, su, su<br/>
Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Put that drum in your ear, don't get Srem'd<br/>
I'll Bobby Shmurda anybody you heard of<br/>
Niggas could not be further, I fathered your style<br/>
Birth of a Nation, Nat Turner style<br/>
Uh, y'all make me turn up all this talkin' down<br/>
Uh, niggas is skippin' leg day just to run they mouth<br/>
I be skippin' leg day, I still run the world<br/>
I pressed ahead of your team with one finger curled<br/>
I'll line you all up with one finger wave<br/>
Make niggas weave, niggas is out here fake<br/>
Laced front to the back, don't front<br/>
Y'all gonna make me wig, I'ma give y'all what you want<br/>
<br/>

Gangsta no live in a tenement yard<br/>

Too much watchy, watchy, watchy<br/>
Too much su, su, su, su, su<br/>

Them su, su, su, su, su<br/>
Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV<br/>

<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>

When mi come a dance and mi spliff and Guinness<br/>
Yow, crowd of peopleâ€“go and mind yuh business<br/>
This a hunting season<br/>
Mek I tell you hunting season<br/>
Well, I tell ya something season<br/>
Yow this a hunting season<br/>
Cake and dumpling season<br/>
Spinners and dumpling season<br/>
Don't play by the king<br/>
Love is all I and I bring you know<br/>
Voice of the one pon gully banking<br/>
Top ranking, keep it skanking<br/>
Ooh wee, huh<br/>
Hear me now
