<i>[Blue Ivy Carter:]</i><br/>
Daddy, what's a will?<br/>
<br/>
Take those moneys and spread 'cross families<br/>
My sisters, Hattie and Lou, the nephews, cousins and TT<br/>
Eric, the rest to B for whatever she wants to do<br/>
She might start an institute<br/>
She might put poor kids through school<br/>
My stake in Roc Nation should go to you<br/>
Leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too<br/>
TIDAL, the champagne, D'USSÃ‰, I'd like to see<br/>
A nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we<br/>
We gon' start a society within a society<br/>
That's major, just like the Negro League<br/>
There was a time America wouldn't let us ball<br/>
Those times are now back, just now called Afro-tech<br/>
Generational wealth, that's the key<br/>
My parents ain't have shit, so that ship started with me<br/>
My mom took her money, she bought me bonds<br/>
That was the sweetest thing of all time, uh<br/>
<br/>
Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy<br/>
Black excellence baby, you gon' let 'em see<br/>
Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy<br/>
Black excellency, baby, let 'em see<br/>
<br/>
I've been listenin' to Wu-Tang and niggas like<br/>
"Your seed, married his seed, married my seed"<br/>
That's how we keep Carter money all in the family<br/>
You see, my father, son of a preacher man<br/>
Whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand<br/>
That charge of energy set all the Carters back<br/>
It took all these years to get to zero in fact<br/>
I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian<br/>
He was preachin' Sundays, versus how he was livin' Monday<br/>
Someday I forgive him<br/>
'Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions<br/>
I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians<br/>
And I was runnin' from him, He was givin' me wisdom<br/>
See how the universe works?<br/>
It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself<br/>
It's a gift and a curse<br/>
That's called the red queens race<br/>
<br/>
You run this hard just to stay in place<br/>
Keep up the pace, baby<br/>
Keep up the pace<br/>
You run this hard just to stay in place<br/>
<br/>
Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy<br/>
Black excellence, you gon' let 'em see<br/>
Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy<br/>
Black excellency, baby, let 'em see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Donny Hathaway:]</i><br/>
Day, someday, someday we'll all<br/>
Someday we'll all be free
