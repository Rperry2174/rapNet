<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Swizz Beatz)]</i><br/>
Yeah! You would think I was on 'roids<br/>

Nah we ain't on HGH<br/>
Though I might pick up some weight when I'm runnin through your state<br/>
(Runnin through your state!) Nah nah nah we ain't on the clear<br/>
We on the runway in back to back Lairs (In the air!)<br/>
Yeah Yeah! It's Ms. No More Drama<br/>
And Barack Obama rhymers feel honored (Talk to 'em HOV)<br/>
I put my life on these tracks<br/>
You act like y'all don't wanna p-pay me for the facts<br/>
Luckily my therapy is to rap<br/>
I just bare my soul I don't expect nothin back (Get it up!)<br/>
Your all welcome long as you felt them<br/>
I was 'gon get mine you know where the hell I'm from<br/>
I'm from the bottom so I do this from the diapers (Stinky!)<br/>
Quick fast turn the big apple into cider (Nasty!)<br/>
I do this, I'm a writer and a rider<br/>
Spew it cause I'm nicer but I do this for the lifers (Tell 'em again Hov!)<br/>
I'm a writer and a rider<br/>
Spew it cause I'm nicer but I do this for the lifers, your welcome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mary J. Blige - singing in tune of Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di"]</i><br/>
To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z (Mary J. Blige) {Swizz Beatz}]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah, you probably never see again<br/>
(Uh-ah!) Somebody so deadly via the pen (No never no)<br/>
Viva Hovito bandito muy bien<br/>
Big up to Biggie and Pac, I do it for them<br/>
Until I rich Kaleek, I do it for him<br/>
Do it for those who can't do for self do to the pen<br/>
May these bars reach through your bar<br/>
And ma, when Mary sing it heals your heart {Hands up! }<br/>
God so Lisa Stansfield you are<br/>
Love Is A Battlefield we all get scarred {OH! }<br/>
AH! I put my heart into this<br/>
This is much more than marketed music<br/>
The reason I got a market to do this<br/>
As there's people goin through pain I'm just walkin 'em through this<br/>
(I'm here for you) This ain't no marketed music<br/>
People goin through pain I'm just talkin 'em through it, your welcome<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige (Swizz Beatz)]</i><br/>
If it wasn't for your love it would all be a dream<br/>
And you made our dreams come true<br/>
That's why y'all don't need to thank us<br/>
Cause we do this all for you (Talk to 'em Mary!)<br/>
We know what you were goin through<br/>
Because we were goin through it too<br/>
When no one seems to understand<br/>
We were always there to hold your hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Jay-Z (Swizz Beatz)]</i><br/>
Sure I taught you 'bout watch brands and watch bands<br/>
I also said watch the man hoppin out of vans (WOO!)<br/>
I ain't only teach you about Efizel<br/>
I told you how to fish and not let other n****s feed you, your welcome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mary J. Blige - singing in tune of Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di"]</i><br/>
To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health<br/>

Your all are welcome, your all are welcome, your all are welcome<br/>
