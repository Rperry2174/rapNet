<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Blessings, blessings yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
I see elephant tusk on the boar of a sailing lady<br/>
Docked on the Ivory Coast<br/>
Mercedes in a row winding down the road<br/>
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo<br/>
Before the Basquait show and if so<br/>
Well fuck it, fuck it<br/>
Because this water drown my family<br/>
This water mixed my blood<br/>
This water tells my story<br/>
This water knows it all<br/>
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water<br/>
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze<br/>
On the waves<br/>
Of the ocean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Dope boy still smelling like cocaina<br/>
White boat, white robe<br/>
Can he be more cleaner<br/>
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up<br/>
I'm anti Santa Maria<br/>
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace<br/>
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket<br/>
Black card go hard when I'm shopping<br/>
Boat dock in front of Hermes picking cotton<br/>
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus<br/>
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get sea sick<br/>
See me in shit you never saw<br/>
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all<br/>
Aww, whole world in awe<br/>
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors<br/>
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven<br/>
Yachting, Ocean 11<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye<br/>
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling opus<br/>
Welcome to the magnum opus<br/>
The Magna Carta<br/>
The best-selling author Decoded<br/>
On the holiday playing "Strange Fruit"<br/>
If I'mma make it to a billi I can't take the same route<br/>
Swoosh<br/>
Now that's the sound of the border<br/>
Swoosh<br/>
Now that's the sound of a baller<br/>
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope, the black Maybach<br/>
I'm back inside the boat<br/>
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope<br/>
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote<br/>
Democrat, nope<br/>
I sold dope<br/>
In trouble water I had to learn how to float<br/>
On the ocean<br/>
I'm in heaven<br/>
Yachting<br/>
Ocean 11<br/>
<br/>
