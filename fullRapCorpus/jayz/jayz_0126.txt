Uhh, yeah, uh-uhh-uh<br/>
Uh-huh, uh-uh-uhh, uhh, uhh<br/>
I ain't tryin to be RUDE DUDE<br/>
but give a nigga some space<br/>
I ain't tryin to be rude dude<br/>
Just, give a nigga some space<br/>
Just tryin to talk honey dog<br/>
I ain't got time to waste (check it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z sings]</i><br/>
Why is you over here lookin at me<br/>
while all these girls up in here?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What you gay?  Nigga Jay straight like indian hair<br/>
Y'all don't want me to spray the semi in here<br/>
I mean if you a fan I consider you fam'<br/>
But shake a nigga hand, but shit god damn<br/>
All that ("Do you remember me dawg?") Nah I'm drawin a blank<br/>
You got me feelin like a fish, in a fish tank<br/>
Just think, if you came to a club<br/>
Tryin to find a little hon for some one-night love<br/>
'Stead you got another nigga all up in your mug<br/>
You make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way!<br/>
And kill the ice grill homes<br/>
Cause I keep enough heat to melt THAT away<br/>
I came in some sweats, I came to get met<br/>
Tryin to find a chick that make it hard for me to "next!"<br/>
We exit stage left, hope in the Lexus<br/>
Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es<br/>
.. may I suggest that it's<br/>
a lot of long-legged chicks in short-ass dresses<br/>
.. go find you one<br/>
Go get your dance on, go grind on one, damn<br/>
.. go find you one<br/>
Go get your dance on, go grind on one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Quick question - yo, why you over here?<br/>
So many hoes in here<br/>
My office hours 9 to 5, whyon'tcha call me there<br/>
It's so many hoes in here<br/>
I ain't tryin to be rude dude, whyon'tcha dissapear?<br/>
There's so many hoes in here<br/>
I understand you got issues but I really don't care<br/>
There's so many hoes in here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yea yea yea I know you rap and your sister spit too<br/>
You been callin the office and you can't get through<br/>
I understand all that, but now ain't the time<br/>
I came to the club to get that off my mind<br/>
And all you thugs with your war stories startin to bore me<br/>
I ain't tryin to hear about your guts and glory<br/>
I'm tryin to hear B.I.G. and some cuts from Nore<br/>
And you keep talkin over the beat like Clue ("Do you remember?")<br/>
.. go find somethin to do<br/>
You're a janitor, go find somethin to screw<br/>
Disappear like Copperfield, go cop a feel<br/>
Play hide and seek witchaself for real, huh<br/>
The chick came dressed up just to get messed up<br/>
She got her hair done, just to get it sweated up<br/>
Shit I'm tryin to help her out<br/>
Whyon'tcha help me out and be out?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Jeah, jeah, jeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland: repeat 3X]</i><br/>
You're invadin my space<br/>
You need to, be easy, ahh<br/>
<br/>
You're invadin my space<br/>
C'mon dawg, be easy, ahh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland]</i><br/>
Uh-uh, I don't know why they do that<br/>
Heh, I don't understand<br/>
Heh, what you need to do, is..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland: repeat 3X]</i><br/>
Stop spittin in my face and go talk to them hoes in here<br/>
<br/>
C'mon dawg, stop spittin in my face and go talk to them hoes in here<br/>
Be easy
