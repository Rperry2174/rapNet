<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This song here..<br/>
.. is dedicated to Danny Dan, and may he rest in peace<br/>
Who at his funeral left us with the words that <br/>
he did it his way (uh-huh, uh-huh)<br/>
So, I have no other choice but to do it my way<br/>
Uh-huh, uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
Uhh! While niggaz are shootin stupid <br/>
I'm carefully plottin, ways to make it rotten<br/>
Well planned hits until you're long forgotten<br/>
Y'all niggaz that utilize my style don't hurt me, cause on the low <br/>
half of these rappin-ass niggaz wanna work for me<br/>
Now picture me standin on somebody block tryin to rock<br/>
I drop bombs and niggaz see me with that dough by eight o'clock<br/>
My feet never touch the concrete, just street sweep awards<br/>
While you're starin on my dick nigga, gimme yours!<br/>
I don't hassle with capsules cause that'll make the grass grow<br/>
and get a project nigga paid up the asshole<br/>
if I'ma risk a frisk, gettin my wrists wrapped up in steel<br/>
I'm out here tryin to make a mill', my shit is real for real<br/>
While others worship guns I worship tons of money<br/>
tons of fun, laughin at shit that ain't even funny<br/>
So I ain't pressed to make a CD, I took it slow<br/>
Eighty percent of these niggaz with deals <br/>
can't see me with the dough, uhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough <br/>
I need a whole lot of dough (for real!)<br/>
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash <br/>
I need a whole lot of cash (stay real!)<br/>
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough <br/>
I need a whole lot of dough *<br/>
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash <br/>
I need a whole lot of cash<br/>
<br/>
*1: (for real!)<br/>
*2: (true!)<br/>
*3: (true!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
More ice than winter ninety-four<br/>
I toured the fifty states with a trunk of raw<br/>
Recrutin, I'm hittin shortiess with consignment, but don't play me<br/>
Ohh you gon' pay me, y'all niggaz ain't crazy!<br/>
I'm laid back in the five thousand Italian leather seat recliner<br/>
under some vagina, discussin the finer, things<br/>
My crib is mean, watchin a hundred inch screen<br/>
Lettin the shorties slide by once in a while and let em dream<br/>
They think I've mastered the game cause dames scream my name <br/>
with passion, I tell em stop flashin and start stashin<br/>
And we'll all get off the corner, the only heat you'll feel <br/>
is from a sauna, lettin bubbles shoot up your ass if you wanna<br/>
And fuck that weed, it keeps you broke, invest in<br/>
pounds of herbs and profit if niggaz wanna smoke dope<br/>
But keep your nuts cause this is a man's game<br/>
And we'll all pop champagne til it's a damn shame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm shootin to Vegas gamblin green-o at the casino<br/>
Schoolin the dice like Vinny Barberino<br/>
Welcome back, the ninety-four version of the mack<br/>
As soon as these ladies see me they don't know how to act<br/>
Cause like that, nigga, never twist the cap of malt liquor<br/>
Only pop and droppin Cristal's down my throat, take a swigga<br/>
My style, ladies intoxicated by my profile<br/>
Your rollin with a pro with, money to blow child<br/>
You need to feel how sweet the skills be<br/>
to come and slide down Sugar Hill with me<br/>
The high roller, rolled up on your dice game <br/>
Unfold a pack of bills, grab my balls then bet it all<br/>
I never slept, cause sleepin keeps you deep in debt<br/>
On the block you lucky if you see my silhouette<br/>
I'm ghost, envied by most<br/>
So I keep a crew of crazy tenants that's sling toast, fucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
