<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Jeah.. uhh.. it's what I do for a livin nigga<br/>
Eat for a livin nigga (watcher)<br/>
That's how I live for a livin nigga.. (watcher)<br/>
Okay, let's do this (the watcher)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Things just ain't the same for gangsters<br/>
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters<br/>
All of these rap singers claimin they bangers<br/>
Doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers<br/>
Disrespectin the game, no home trainin or manners<br/>
I was doin this shit when you was shittin Pampers<br/>
I was movin them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was<br/>
Duckin the vans, radars, the scanners<br/>
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was<br/>
I was hittin the turnpike, aight with the bammers<br/>
I was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers<br/>
I was prickin my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was<br/>
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was<br/>
Three hundred mill' later, now you understand us<br/>
Y'all ain't see us comin through Vegas<br/>
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night<br/>
Grand fucked up one fight<br/>
I was on the Peter Pan bus<br/>
You was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fuckin with whom?<br/>
Allowed me to be taught<br/>
You cowards is just now learnin the shit that we talk<br/>
You niggaz ain't know about a Robb Report<br/>
Bout a high speed Porsche, i.e.<br/>
You niggaz ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door<br/>
like "Eric B. for Pres," respect me in this BITCH!<br/>
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut<br/>
You was suckin for so long, fuckin your little neck up<br/>
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches<br/>
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous<br/>
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game<br/>
It's only right I got the right to be king<br/>
Niggaz that got life really like what I sing<br/>
Cause they know is he really like, niggaz feel my pain<br/>
Know the shit I DON'T write be the illest shit that's ever been recited<br/>
in the game word to the hyphen in my NAME!<br/>
J, A, Y, DASH, Hoffa<br/>
The past present nigga the future, proper<br/>
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us<br/>
We give, Dre his props BUT that's where it stops<br/>
It's the Roc<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Truth Hurts]</i><br/>
I know, you got your eyes on me<br/>
I feel you watchin me<br/>
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me<br/>
You try, but what you think you saw<br/>
Ain't what you thought you saw<br/>
You bed-da off not lookin at all<br/>
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as befo')<br/>
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')<br/>
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)<br/>
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I'm still on top of the game<br/>
Still droppin flames, still cock and aim<br/>
Still at the top had the Roc for the fame<br/>
over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came<br/>
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained<br/>
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain<br/>
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim<br/>
the streets, they made a special spot for my name<br/>
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign<br/>
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins<br/>
The pride and the pain<br/>
All the way back from the rise of my name<br/>
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane<br/>
See the world chear for the rhymes that I gave<br/>
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane<br/>
The eyes that I played<br/>
The best to emerge in the game is The Watcher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Rakim]</i><br/>
I'm "Rated R," my brain contains graphics thangs<br/>
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends<br/>
It's like, watchin a movie through a panoramic screen<br/>
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene<br/>
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket<br/>
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it<br/>
take away the added profit, it's catastrophic<br/>
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it<br/>
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully<br/>
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me<br/>
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny<br/>
In the place where the number one cause of death is money<br/>
You can try copin<br/>
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken<br/>
I'm still alive and scopin<br/>
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in<br/>
And I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
