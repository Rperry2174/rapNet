You know how we do, Roc-a-Fella... forever... You can catch me<br/>
skatin through your town puttin it down y'all relatin<br/>
No waitin I'll make your block infrared hot I'm like Satan<br/>
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to<br/>
hustle behind the wheel, tryin to escape my trouble<br/>
kids stop they greetin me, I'm talkin sweet to keys<br/>
Cursin the very God, that bought this wreath to be<br/>
My life is, based on sacrifices, jewels like ices<br/>
and fools that think I slip, you fuck around<br/>
you get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy<br/>
on some I-do-or-die shit, for real<br/>
The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and<br/>
just think, with this here, I'm tryin to feel made nig-ga<br/>
<br/>
Politics as us-ual... I took my<br/>
Frito to Tito in the district, blessed me with some<br/>
VS somethins I can live with, stop frontin<br/>
And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised<br/>
No disrespect to you, make sure you word is true<br/>
I'm takin wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson<br/>
have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off<br/>
You ain't seen money in your life, when it<br/>
comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice<br/>
A smokin bro, who pump Willie Ike spokes<br/>
The furthest you Chiles been is the Pocanos<br/>
My portfolio reads: leads to Don Corleone, nigga please<br/>
Ten year feleon, heavy on the wrist, our face used<br/>
with the diamond blooded Jesus and blind your face<br/>
youse for life... sharight, Jigga, I keep it tight nig-ga<br/>
<br/>
Politics as us-ual...<br/>
You feel my triumph never, feel my pain I'm lyin<br/>
Low in the leather Zion, the best that's ever came<br/>
The game changes like, my mind just ain't right<br/>
We 'gwan get this dough, I guess it ain't your night<br/>
Suckin me in like a vacumn, I remember<br/>
tellin my family I'll be back soon, that was December<br/>
Eighty-five and, Jay-Z rise ten years later<br/>
got me wise still can't break my underworld ties<br/>
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot<br/>
Got matchin VCR's, a huge Magnavox<br/>
to nitch, green like spinach pop wines that's vintage<br/>
It's a lot of big money in my sentence<br/>
Hittin towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that<br/>
chick faked me one-two cat, yeah, I do dat<br/>
Ain't no stoppin the champagne from poppin<br/>
the drawers from droppin, the law from watchin, I hate em<br/>
<br/>
Politics as us-ual
