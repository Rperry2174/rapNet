<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
By the way yo<br/>
Yo, how the fuck you gonna talk about MC's on our hill<br/>
When we just cop them things homey the chromy wheels<br/>
Both arms are chunky the sleeves on chill<br/>
Any given times 100 G's in your grill<br/>
Don't talk to me bout MC's got skillz<br/>
He's alright but he's not real<br/>
Jay-Z's that deal with seeds in a field<br/>
Never fear for war, hug, squeeze that steel<br/>
Fuck, you gotta a flow that's cool with me<br/>
You gotta lil' dough that cool with me<br/>
You gotta little cars little jewelries<br/>
But none of y'all motherfuckers could fool with me<br/>
You know the wrist frost bit minus two degrees<br/>
Bout as blue as the sea the way I manuever the V<br/>
Hat cocked can't see his eyes, who could it be?<br/>
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me?<br/>
Niggaz shift two million, then I blew the three<br/>
Then I skated the four, before I went on tour<br/>
I came back and it's plain<br/>
Y'all niggaz ain't rappin the same<br/>
Fuck the flow y'all jackin our slang<br/>
I seen the same shit happen to Kane<br/>
Three cuts in your eyebrow tryin to wild out<br/>
The game is ours will never foul out<br/>
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out<br/>
Throw your hands up<br/>
Niggaz, Bitches, Bustas, Hustlers FUCK THAT<br/>
(Throw the hands up)<br/>
