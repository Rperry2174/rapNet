Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body.<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Secret Society, Tryin to keep their eye on me<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body.<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
I can't Die, I can't Die, I can't Die <i>[echoes fade]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Uh, yeah)<br/>
This shit is wicked on these mean streets<br/>
None of my friends speak<br/>
We're all trying to win, but then again<br/>
Maybe it's for the best though, 'cause when your're saying too much<br/>
You know they're trying to get you touched<br/>
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldn't understand the mechanics<br/>
And the workings of the underworld, granted<br/>
Nine to five is how ya survive, I ain't trying to survive<br/>
I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it alive<br/>
Life ills, poison my body<br/>
I used to say 'fuck mic skills, ' and never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti<br/>
That's right it's wicked, west life I live it<br/>
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, endz<br/>
I break bread with the late heads, picking their brains for angles on<br/>
All the evils that the game'll do<br/>
It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us<br/>
And now we're lethal, infected with D'Evils...<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body.<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Secret Society, Tryin to keep their eye on me<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body.<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
I can't Die, I can't Die, I can't Die <i>[echoes fade]</i><br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
We used to fight for building blocks<br/>
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing<br/>
The closest of friends when we first started<br/>
But grew apart as the money grew, and soon grew black-hearted<br/>
Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers<br/>
He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother<br/>
My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese<br/>
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties<br/>
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced<br/>
So I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense<br/>
Who could ever forsee, we used to stay up all night at slumber parties<br/>
Now I'm trying to rock this bitch to sleep<br/>
All the years we were real close<br/>
Now I see his fears through her tears, know she's wishing we were still close<br/>
Don't cry, it is to be<br/>
In time, I'll take away your miseries and make 'em mine, D'Evils...<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body.<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Secret Society, Tryin to keep their eye on me<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body.<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
I can't Die, I can't Die, I can't Die <i>[echoes fade]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
My flesh, no nigga could test<br/>
My soul is possessed by D'Evils in the form of diamonds and lexuses<br/>
The exorcist, got me doing skits like Homie<br/>
You don't know me, but the whole world owe me<br/>
Strip!<br/>
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life<br/>
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothing nice<br/>
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly<br/>
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me<br/>
Liquors invaded my kidneys<br/>
Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me<br/>
I can't be held accountable, D'Evils beating me down, boo<br/>
Got me running with guys, making G's, telling lies that sound true<br/>
Come test me, I never cower<br/>
For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers<br/>
Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die<br/>
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'Evils...<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
I can't Die, I can't Die, I can't Die <i>[echoes fade]</i><br/>
<i>[Disc scratch and fade]</i>
