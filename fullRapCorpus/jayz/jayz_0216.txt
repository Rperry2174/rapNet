Hey sucka nigga<br/>
Where ever you are<br/>
I thought about ya fool<br/>
While I was driving my car<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you fools<br/>
Realize how far<br/>
You are<br/>
You're no where in my rear mirror<br/>
<br/>
Your last shit ain't better<br/>
Than my first shit<br/>
Your best shit<br/>
Ain't better than my worst shit<br/>
<br/>
The truth in my verses<br/>
Versus<br/>
Your metaphors<br/>
About what your net worth is
