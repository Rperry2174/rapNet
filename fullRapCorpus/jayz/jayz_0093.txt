"I'm not a one girl's guy... (real talk for ya, peep game)<br/>
aint they know it, when it comes to love, I don't lie (we don't lie man)<br/>
and the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)<br/>
aint gonna say my nose? can't be over (I may never say never)<br/>
right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from"<br/>
(too many ladies, ha)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK:]</i> I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore<br/>
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya<br/>
Holla at ya when I come off tour<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh<br/>
who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin<br/>
got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question<br/>
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression<br/>
to put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge<br/>
she gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college<br/>
knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring<br/>
in and out I'm movin through her student body union and<br/>
she, call me professor, say daddy come and test her<br/>
so she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester<br/>
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate<br/>
she said, I aint no fool I make it up in summer school<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK:]</i><br/>
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore<br/>
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya<br/>
Holla at ya when I come off tour<br/>
Now let the people sing<br/>
I'm tryin girls out, (just tryin girls out) just tryin girls out<br/>
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya<br/>
Holla at ya when I come off tour<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Heh, who you lovin, who you wanna be fuckin<br/>
who said what, why you trippin girl, why's you fussin?<br/>
got this model slash actress slash part time waitress<br/>
spend a whole day she hangin round with part time haters<br/>
all they do is diss dirt and put a up on my latest<br/>
itinerary, but since I tend to vary see<br/>
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys<br/>
tend to hurries in ten places at once<br/>
plus she can't front just peep how I run mines<br/>
ma, our time together is our time together, and uh<br/>
our time apart is our time apart<br/>
so love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart<br/>
and some day I slow down, but for now I get around<br/>
like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches<br/>
or caine and O-dog, stick up tape from menace<br/>
you tell 'em chicks if they must know my buisness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK:]</i><br/>
I'm tryin girls out, just tryin girls out<br/>
put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya<br/>
holla at ya when I get off tour<br/>
I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore<br/>
yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya<br/>
holla at ya when I come off tour<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I'm lookin for, southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle<br/>
big ghetto booty, scarf over doobie<br/>
Chanell under the louie, Gucci over booty<br/>
Vicki covered titties, attitude of the city<br/>
pretty, witty, girly, whirly<br/>
one who likes to party but come home early<br/>
light kinda dark, short sorta tall<br/>
slim, kinda thick I swear I love 'em all<br/>
she can cook the coke and got hook up on the license<br/>
but she can get you first class seats for coach prices<br/>
isn't this great, my flight leaves at eight<br/>
her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK:]</i><br/>
I'm tryin girls out, just tryin girls out<br/>
put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya<br/>
holla at ya when I get off tour<br/>
I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore<br/>
yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya<br/>
holla at ya when I come off tour<br/>
<br/>
"I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it<br/>
when it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it<br/>
aint gonna say my nose? can't be over,<br/>
but right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from<br/>
I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently,<br/>
just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me"
