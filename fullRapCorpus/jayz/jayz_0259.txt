<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Who's house? Hov no doubt<br/>
'Bout the only rapper still gettin money in the drought<br/>
I moves out, in the global, I'm a mogul<br/>
Fifty thousand feet in the air and I'm still on my mobile<br/>
Fuck talking bout the recession the shit's depressin<br/>
I rock with Obama but I'm not a politician<br/>
And I, chill with the thugs and the gangsters too<br/>
I ain't a blood but I'm warrin with the boys in blue<br/>
Crooked officer!!! crooked officer!!!<br/>
Why you wanna see me in a coffin sir?!<br/>
Is it against the law the way I'm flossin sir?!<br/>
Benzes, Rolls Royces and Porches, UGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
Haters like Hov why you still talkin money shit? <br/>
Cause I like money BITCH!!!!<br/>
I like fly shit, you like gossip<br/>
I let you do you, why you ridin my tip?<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
That bloke from Oasis said I couldn't play guitar<br/>
Somebody shoulda told him I'm a fuckin rock star<br/>
<i>[imitating "Wonderwall"]</i> Today, is gonna be the day<br/>
That I'm gonna throw it back to yoooooou<br/>
I'm livin life as a rocker, I'm like Pimp C, pat'na<br/>
Comin down in Mercedes, peelin off on the boppers<br/>
Worldwide show, I'm comin down in a chopper<br/>
Hundred eighty-thou screamin "Hov!" with the Roc up<br/>
It's too easy!!! I got ladies on shoulders showin me they chi-chis<br/>
I met honey at the show last year<br/>
And now I'm actin brand new like a (world premier)<br/>
Yeah, I know life ain't fair<br/>
But chill, baby girl - MY GIRL IS HERRRE!<br/>
I got models in a mosh pit<br/>
Dancin off-beat, but they know the words to my shit!<br/>

<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
You ain't gotta jock Jay-Z, jock fly shit<br/>
You ain't gotta jock me, homey, jock my chick<br/>
Jock her cinatti, she (Body) you with her fit<br/>
No that's not Pilates, her body is just thick<br/>
You ain't gotta jock her nigga, jock my clique <br/>
Jock the dope boys 'cause we all tossed bricks <br/>
Federallis jock me while I'm crossin the bridge <br/>
Click, click - take a portrait of this<br/>
I ain't no pretty boy I got a georgeous wrist <br/>
Cut handsome checks and my flow's pretty, sick<br/>
I'm some ghetto chic, I'm where the hood and high fashion meet<br/>
Oooh wee I'm like the camouflauge Louis<br/>
How you niggas want it the tux or the toolie?!<br/>
Haters, I ain't mad at you<br/>
If I wasn't I probably jock me too<br/>
