<i>[Jay-Z]</i> It was all a dream<br/>
<i>[scratched simultaneously: "It was all a dream" - B.I.G.]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Faith Evans + (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Last night I had a dream<br/>
Thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)<br/>
Felt so real to me<br/>
This is what was said..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Had a dream I said, about who he said?<br/>
about B.I.G. I said, that's big he said<br/>
Dig what he said, proceed he said<br/>
Indeed I said, so - breathe I did<br/>
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing<br/>
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this<br/>
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said<br/>
It came to me like a well as even I said<br/>
"What's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said<br/>
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?<br/>
"More money -- more problems, better believe it," he said<br/>
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said<br/>
I see I said, jealousy I said<br/>
Got the whole industry mad at me I said<br/>
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself<br/>
nobody built like you, you've designed yourself"<br/>
I agree I said, my one of a kind self<br/>
Get stoned every day like Jesus did<br/>
What he said, I said, has been said before<br/>
"Just keep doing your thing," he said, say no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Faith Evans]</i><br/>
Was it all a dream - tell me<br/>
Was it all a dream, was it a dream<br/>
Was it all a dream<br/>
I gotta know ("It was all a dream")<br/>
Was it all a dream - was it a dream<br/>
Was it all a dream, a dream<br/>
Was it all a dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Notorious B.I.G.]</i><br/>
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine<br/>
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine<br/>
Hanging pictures on my wall<br/>
Every Saturday, "Rap Attack," Mr. Magic, Marley Marl<br/>
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped<br/>
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock<br/>
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack<br/>
with the hat to match<br/>
Remember Rappin' Duke? "Duh-ha, duh-ha"<br/>
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far<br/>
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight<br/>
Time to get paid, blow up like the ("World Trade")<br/>
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner<br/>
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner<br/>
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri<br/>
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky<br/>
I'm blowing up like you thought I would<br/>
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good<br/>
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Faith Evans]</i><br/>
Was it all a dream - tell me<br/>
Was it all a dream, was it a dream<br/>
Was it all a dream<br/>
I gotta know ("It was all a dream")<br/>
Was it all a dream - was it a dream<br/>
Was it all a dream, a dream<br/>
Was it all a dream<br/>
<br/>
("It was all.. a dream")<br/>
("It was all..")<br/>
("It was all.. a dream")<br/>
("It was all a dream")<br/>
("It was all.. a dream")<br/>
("It was all..")<br/>
("It was all.. a dream")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[the beat drops out and Jay-Z raps the next part acapella]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I see I said, jealousy I said<br/>
Got the whole industry mad at me I said<br/>
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself<br/>
nobody built like you, you've designed yourself"<br/>
I agree I said, my one of a kind self<br/>
Get stoned every day like Jesus did<br/>
What he said, I said, has been said before<br/>
"Just keep doing your thing," he said, say no more
