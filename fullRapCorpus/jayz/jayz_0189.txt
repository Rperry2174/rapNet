I know i shouldnt've did that <br/>
I know its gon' come right back <br/>
I know its gon' destroy everything i made <br/>
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away <br/>
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it <br/>
Its inevitable that i'm- <br/>
<br/>
Said where i would stop before i even started <br/>
When i get to one brick, then The Game i will depart with <br/>
Got to one brick then i looked to the sky, said <br/>
Sorry God, i lied, but give me one more try <br/>
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips <br/>
But niggas never learn til' they end up in the newsclip <br/>
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like i'm using it <br/>
Guess its two sides to what 'substance abuse' is <br/>
Can't stop, won't stop, nigga since new shit <br/>
Brand new convertibles, i'm so ruthless <br/>
Front row, fight night-see how big my tube is? <br/>
Fuck HD, nigga see how clear my view is? <br/>
(FALLING) <br/>
But there's a price for overdoing it <br/>
Doin' it this big'll put you on the map <br/>
Stick-up kids is out some tax <br/>
Plus the FBI Boys with the cameras in the back, DAMN! <br/>
<br/>
I know i shouldnt've did that <br/>
I know its gon' come right back <br/>
I know its gon' destroy everything I made <br/>
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away <br/>
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it <br/>
Its inevitable - <br/>
<br/>
Now you're <br/>
(FALLING) <br/>
When you should've scaled back, <br/>
Now you're <br/>
(FALLING) <br/>
Right into they lap <br/>
Falling, they applaud and they screamin' at the screen <br/>
"Damn, you fucked up!" like your favorite movie scene <br/>
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino <br/>
You seen what that last run did to DeNiro <br/>
When he can't beat the odds, can't cheat the cards <br/>
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards <br/>
Now you're tumbling, its humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling <br/>
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming <br/>
(FALLING) <br/>
Now let's pray that arm candy <br/>
That you left your Ex- for stay 'down' and come in handy <br/>
Cause come January, it gets cold <br/>
When the letters start to slow, when your commissary's low <br/>
When your lawyer screams "Appeal!" only thinkin' bout a bill <br/>
When your chances are nil, damn, gravity's ill... <br/>
<br/>
I know i shouldnt've did that <br/>
I know its gon' come right back <br/>
I know its gon' destroy everything i made <br/>
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away <br/>
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it <br/>
Its inevitable- <br/>
<br/>
That you're <br/>
(FALLING) <br/>
And you can't get up <br/>
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up <br/>
Locked down, the town now belongs to the Squares <br/>
Who say they won't make the same mistakes that got you there <br/>
And ya arm candy's sweet on 'em <br/>
Every woman that you left for this heffa got a college degree comin' <br/>
Bad news keeps coming <br/>
Hard to keep something on your stomach <br/>
You're sick 'bout what your life is becoming <br/>
(FALLING) <br/>
Bunch of used to's, has been's bragging bad 'bout all the new dudes <br/>
Talking tough on the YouTube bout what you used to do <br/>
But that's old school to the new crew <br/>
They're doing numbers like Sudoku <br/>
They're the new you <br/>
And its damn near inevitable they'll experience deja vu too <br/>
Fight, and you'll never survive <br/>
Run, and you'll never escape <br/>
So just fall from grace, damn.... <br/>
<br/>
I know i shouldnt've did that <br/>
I know its gon' come right back <br/>
I know its gon' destroy everything i made <br/>
Its probably gon' get ya boy sent away <br/>
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it <br/>
Its inevitable that i'm <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like I'm Falling <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like i'm Falling <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like I'm Falling <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like i'm Falling <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like I'm Falling <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like i'm Falling <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like I'm Falling <br/>
FALLING <br/>
Seems like i'm......
