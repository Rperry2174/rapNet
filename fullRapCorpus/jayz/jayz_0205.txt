<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
Yeah 3 in the morning on the Westside highway, top down baby,<br/>
F-ck y’all<br/>
The motivation for me was them telling me what I couldn’t be,<br/>
Oh well,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This a special dedication,<br/>
I wanna thank you for the fuel,<br/>
No really thank you,<br/>
<br/>
I felt so inspired by what my teacher said,<br/>
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head,<br/>
Now sure if thats how adults should speak ta kids,<br/>
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class,<br/>
I teach his ass,<br/>
Even betters what my uncle did,<br/>
I pop my demo tape in start to beat my head,<br/>
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his,<br/>
He might as well say beat it kid, he’s on the list,<br/>
Its like Im searching for kicks like a sneaker head,<br/>
He gon keep pushing me until I reach the ledge,<br/>
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell em all to eat a d-ck,<br/>
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread,<br/>
Spread spread.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell - Chorus]</i><br/>
Motivation for me was them telling me what I could not be,<br/>
Oh well,<br/>
I’m so ambitious,<br/>
I might hit two sisters,<br/>
Hey im on a mission<br/>
No matter what the conditions,<br/>
Forget the personal issues<br/>
When you been what I been through,<br/>
Hey if you believe it,<br/>
Then you could conceive it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I had to lace up my boots even harder,<br/>
Father is too far away to father,<br/>
Further-more of the kids either smoke reefer,<br/>
Or either move white, theres few writers in my cipher,<br/>
So they made lighter, my type a dreams seem dumb<br/>
They said wise up, how many guys a you see making it from here,<br/>
The world don’t like us, is that not clear, alright,<br/>
But I'm different, I can’t base what I'm gonna be off a what everybody isn’t,<br/>
They don’t listen, just whispering behind my back,<br/>
No vision, lack of ambition,<br/>
So wack!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Had a couple of meetings no offers yet,<br/>
Maybe I aint good enough for these offices,<br/>
Back to the drawing board ducking officers,<br/>
It’s all good cos the streets is A&amp;R’ing this,<br/>
So with or without any of your involvement,<br/>
Coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate,<br/>
I went from pauper to the President,<br/>
Every deal I ever made set precedent,<br/>
N-ggas thought I'd fall without old buddy,<br/>
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money,<br/>
Dear Teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker,<br/>
I’m balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers,<br/>
F-ck y’all,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
