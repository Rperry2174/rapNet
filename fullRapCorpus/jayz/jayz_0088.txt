The most incredible baby<br/>
Uhh - mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm<br/>
Yeah, yeah.. uhh<br/>
<br/>
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Good dudes - I know you love me like cooked food<br/>
Even though a nigga got move like a crook move<br/>
We was together on the block since free lunch<br/>
We shoulda been together havin 4 Seasons brunch<br/>
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather<br/>
So now we travel first class to change the forecast<br/>
Never in bunches, just me and you<br/>
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches<br/>
Still I left you for months on end<br/>
It's been months since I checked back in<br/>
Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down<br/>
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down<br/>
I can understand why you want a divorce now<br/>
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it<br/>
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with<br/>
But deep inside a nigga so sick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta let the song cry<br/>
I can't see it comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I can't see it comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
On repeat, the CD of Big's "Me and My Bitch"<br/>
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin to be that shit<br/>
Empty gun in your hand sayin, "Let me see that clip"<br/>
Shoppin sprees, pull out your Visa quick<br/>
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip<br/>
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6<br/>
We was so happy poor but when we got rich<br/>
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped<br/>
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit<br/>
Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it<br/>
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick<br/>
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me<br/>
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me<br/>
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy<br/>
And then they got fussy and they don't remember that<br/>
And I don't remember you..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I can't see it comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I can't see it comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
Yeah I seen 'em comin down your eyes<br/>
But I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I can't see it comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone<br/>
Word back home is that you had a special friend<br/>
So what was oh so special then?<br/>
You have given away without gettin at me<br/>
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?<br/>
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?<br/>
I know the way a nigga livin was whack<br/>
But you don't get a nigga back like that!<br/>
Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that<br/>
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that<br/>
You don't throw away what we had, just like that<br/>
I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon' get right back<br/>
They say you can't turn a bad girl good<br/>
But once a good girl's goin bad, she's gone forever..<br/>
I'll mourn forever<br/>
Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta let the song cry<br/>
I know I seen 'em comin down your eyes<br/>
But I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It's fucked up girl..
