<i>[Jay-Z - Chorus]</i><br/>
When the sky falls and the Earth quakes<br/>
We gon put this back together<br/>
We won’t break<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Sa Pa Sé, my Port-Au-Princes<br/>
My Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses<br/>
Our condolences as you fightin’ against this<br/>
We’re right by your side as we tryin’ to make sense of this<br/>
Heavenly father help us see through these problems<br/>
And for those that left, accept them into your garden<br/>
So here’s my theory, the country’s already starvin’<br/>
So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them<br/>
God please pardon, I speak from the heart<br/>
It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them<br/>
So lets get involved with them, hand to hand with them<br/>
Arm to arm with them til' they get strong again,<br/>
When the sky falls...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna and Bono – Hook]</i><br/>
Can’t wait until tomorrow<br/>
Haiti, Mon Amour<br/>
Haiti, Mon Amour<br/>
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone<br/>
oh no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z Verse 2]</i><br/>
Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded<br/>
So we know we just can’t rely on the government<br/>
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when<br/>
When we gon catch a break, my friend lost his mother and then<br/>
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them<br/>
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them<br/>
And the tears fall, and we fight back<br/>
Story ain’t done, it can’t end like that<br/>
Nah not like this, tomorrow’s survivors gonna carry on your name<br/>
You live on inside us, your memory’s alive with us<br/>
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bono]</i><br/>
It’s not the angels that are on their way<br/>
It's not the bells of Santa Trinite<br/>
The people waiting, positions vacant<br/>
For hands to help, not just to pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[French singing]</i><br/>
Haïti va s’élever<br/>
Tu vas te relever<br/>
Nous nous éléverons<br/>
Ensemble ensemble ensemble<br/>
<br/>
(not gonna leave you stranded...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We gon put this back together we won't break<br/>
We gon put this back together we won't break<br/>
We gon put this back together we won't break<br/>
We gon put this back together we won't break
