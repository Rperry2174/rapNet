YO, they call me William H. (H!) the all-time great (GREAT!)<br/>
I fuck the most hoes out of New York State (STATE!)<br/>
I rock my jewels (JEWELS) I'm not a fool (FOOL!)<br/>
In the small of my back I got this big-ass tool (Ha hah!)<br/>
When I'm skatin through the city and I stop and kick it<br/>
Be the most asked question - how I got them digits?<br/>
I say I stay on my grind, never stop for bitches<br/>
Never talk like a mom, I gotta watch you snitches<br/>
And I stick to the script, that's my advice so life<br/>
Eat nigga, let it stick to your ribs<br/>
I seen niggaz go from handlin birds to ramblin words<br/>
to the man, seen a Sammy the Bull emerge on the stand<br/>
And it was all good just a week ago<br/>
We lost Todd E., but we still eatin though<br/>
For like a hundred weeks nigga, we gon' run the streets<br/>
til we reach Malik or the date of E's release<br/>
Peep Hova in a Jeep Rover, passin reefer over<br/>
to this freak, breathe mami this is good weed mami<br/>
Three, hymies under the belt, three extra clip<br/>
We aim, we shoot; y'all shoot aim, we stick to the script<br/>
C'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
We cop, we flip, we re-up; get back on our shift<br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
<i>[scratch]</i> "You can bullshit with rap if you want, muh'fuckers"<br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
We cop, we flip, we re-up; get back on our shift<br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
<i>[scratch]</i> "You in the streets nigga, make your moves"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[scratch]</i> "Y'all niggaz truly ain't ready for this dynasty thing"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Geah, uh-huh<br/>
Yeah, money over bitches nigga<br/>
<i>[scratch]</i> "This Philly cat ba.. back at it"<br/>
Stick to the script, yo<br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo they don't call me Mac for nuttin<br/>
I don't give a whore jack, man they all say that Mac be frontin<br/>
But if you can't take a case bitch and take it to the chin<br/>
take the heat, beat your feet bitch, skate in the wind<br/>
Don't snitch, we can blow dough, make it again<br/>
You can be my hoe bitch, I can't make you my friend<br/>
because - friends depend on friends, not Bean Sigel's shit<br/>
I don't need you; let welfare feed you<br/>
Mac'll, stick to the script, and stick to the flip<br/>
I got a sick whip game, water stick to the bricks<br/>
I got a sick flip game, order gettin and shit<br/>
I got a strict strip, flip 'caine, get it in shifts<br/>
Bitch, you can't get at me, shit I get at you<br/>
only in the physical, I tell you like Mystikal<br/>
"Shake that ass (yeah) watch yourself<br/>
(Yeah) show me what you workin with but wash yourself"<br/>
Fuck a dirty bitch (yeah) man I roll with a sturdy click<br/>
that'll murder shit, empty clips you never heard a spit<br/>
Slide a bitch what? Slide a bitch shit<br/>
Slide a bitch dick, then I slide out a bitch shit<br/>
Ain't no time to stick around and play step pops<br/>
Shit I'm tryin to get down, cop and upset blocks<br/>
Low price, quick flip, 2-8-K quick<br/>
Shit don't go right, 2 AK's spit - stick to the script nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
We cop, we flip, we re-up; get back on our shift<br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
..<br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
We cop, we flip, we re-up; get back on our shift<br/>
Money over bitches nigga stick to the script<br/>
Y'all get knocked, y'all turn bitch<br/>
We get knocked, we never snitch, c'mon
