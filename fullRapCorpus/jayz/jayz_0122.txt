<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Please believe that) Some how some way<br/>
We gotta make it up out the hood some day<br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gotta make it up out this life<br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gotta make it up out this life<br/>
Some way we gotta make it up out this life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Weather we dribble out this motherfucker<br/>
Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker<br/>
Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker<br/>
Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker<br/>
Some day the cops will kill a motherfucker<br/>
I don't always want to be this drug dealing<br/>
Motherfucker damn<br/>
Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride<br/>
Through the sky I<br/>
Use to play the hall up fifth floor me and my boys we<br/>
All poor getting high I<br/>
seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing<br/>
I received I'm from the dirt<br/>
I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park<br/>
Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand and<br/>
Still I grew some how I knew the sun will shine through<br/>
And touch my soul take hold of my hand<br/>
Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Some how some way<br/>
I gotta make it up out the hood someday<br/>
Some how some way<br/>
I gotta make it up out this life<br/>
Some way I gotta make it up out this hood someday<br/>

<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i> To old Nell, Sigel street I ain't forget you<br/>
<br/>
Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck<br/>
Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck<br/>
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up<br/>
Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck<br/>
Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up<br/>
Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up<br/>
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up<br/>
Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up<br/>
Then they wonder why we light green up<br/>
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't<br/>
I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up<br/>
It's my head stress to the point I get a fever<br/>
Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids<br/>
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em<br/>
For the rest of their life fucking wings fried<br/>
Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)<br/>
No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night<br/>
Our kids eating lunch at night<br/>
In their beds all bunched in tight<br/>
No less than three or four(you know how it go)<br/>
Two by the foot two by the headboard<br/>
Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)<br/>
Thats how I feel for them<br/>
And we gotta grip the shorties on the block<br/>
All they do is smoke weed and drink forties<br/>
Cop their quarties<br/>
Enough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, and old Jordies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gonna make it up out the hood someday<br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gonna make it up out this life<br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gonna make it up out the hood one day<br/>
Some way we gonna make it up out this life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Scarface]</i><br/>
Right here another lil' story bout this click I claimed<br/>
Another chapter based on how I get that game<br/>
Hanging round my neighborhood and bang my street<br/>
Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep<br/>
South-side sunny side<br/>
Blocks I run South Vegas, South Paul<br/>
Nigga all got guns<br/>
Over here we got this poor (?) get that there<br/>
We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that there<br/>
Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps<br/>
Working inside a slump house starving to death<br/>
Serving these nigga flippers, quarter-ounces and<br/>
Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors<br/>
Plotting to get ya<br/>
Situations is critic I was out here to get it<br/>
Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it<br/>
And holding back all the mothers for a minute<br/>
Pumping hard dog<br/>
Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all dog<br/>
Love being willied and your creek gonna rise<br/>
I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise<br/>
(Some how some way)<br/>
(Some how some way)<br/>
I'm be a nigga and these streets gonna rise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gotta make it up out the hood some day<br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gotta make it up out this life<br/>
Some how some way<br/>
We gotta make it up out the hood some day<br/>
Some way we gotta make it up out this life<br/>
<br/>
