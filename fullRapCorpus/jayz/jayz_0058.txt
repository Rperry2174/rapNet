Jigga man, Swizz Beats<br/>
History in the making, part three<br/>
Lights out ladies!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2x]</i><br/>
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (to all my baby thugs)<br/>
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)<br/>
Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder)<br/>
Let me scream your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters<br/>
Busters they wanted to rush us<br/>
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya<br/>
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right<br/>
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night<br/>
When the summertime is in and the tops are down<br/>
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)<br/>
It took shortsleeves and loungin' to understand<br/>
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze<br/>
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you<br/>
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you<br/>
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do<br/>
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools<br/>
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you<br/>
So I devoted half my time to invest in you<br/>
The other half was spent on protecting you<br/>
Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm often with you so they wonder bout the juice I got<br/>
I took you from the projects and an abusive pops<br/>
From the bottom to the top<br/>
The skateboard to the drop<br/>
From the nada to the Prada<br/>
I got ya like I got ya<br/>
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya<br/>
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow<br/>
Soon I spent every dolla you became my habit<br/>
other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats<br/>
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew<br/>
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue<br/>
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my Boo<br/>
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too<br/>
Cop my jewels twice, like deja vu<br/>
If they ever met in the mall, it's ova ya'll<br/>
Just the way I do, and either way you win<br/>
I mean the thugs love ya when your girl's best friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
And the wedding band you love<br/>
In the gold chain you thug<br/>
Sometimes you given just because<br/>
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations<br/>
Know that they wanna fuck the only reason they give you up<br/>
In the hands of goldiggas you never enough<br/>
Rings, things, just never enough<br/>
With me and you together gon shine to the end<br/>
I mean the thugs love ya but ya girls best friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus til end]</i>
