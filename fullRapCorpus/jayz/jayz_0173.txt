UH <br/>
Dig a whole burry yourself niggah <br/>
Go ahead, keep goin i got some nice dresses for you guys over there <br/>
The Incomparable H.O. <br/>
<br/>
UH <br/>
Yesss <br/>
What you see now? <br/>
Came, conquered <br/>
We g'on see now <br/>
Dig a Hole <br/>
Go 'head <br/>
MotherFucker, burry yourself <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
<br/>
I'm still hear mon frerre<br/>
you know the cost i bear<br/>
like, thats why they call you Hov, I'm like yeah<br/>
like air<br/>
little shots go through me, wont tear one tissue<br/>
no tears no tissue, not an issue<br/>
Dont cry for me I peep these niggahz from deep<br/>
By the front row seat even if you dont speak<br/>
Silent pardon, I hear you loud and clear<br/>
You left your fingure print, you aint gotta be there<br/>
I'm just waitin 'till you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in<br/>
then i'm gon' body them<br/>
It's nothing but a hobby to him<br/>
Simple as serve and volley to him<br/>
Niggahz like "Hov why dont you get at ol' boy"<br/>
Why kill a puppet and leave Cheppetto alive (from pinocio)<br/>
Why not wait till you get em all together, thats when you dig one big hole, one time<br/>
<br/>
What you see now? <br/>
We gon' see clown <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Go 'head, burry yourself <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Go 'head <br/>
<br/>
Hows niggahs dissin me? I made it possible<br/>
For niggahs to make history, How is the possible?<br/>
Please explain this shit to me, How is it logical?<br/>
Have we forgot our history? lets open our bibles<br/>
Its like the disciples dissing Jesus becoming his rivals<br/>
Shunning teh one thing that they owe their life to<br/>
You let that man hype you to go against your idol<br/>
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do<br/>
Think I'm in the office I lost my grind<br/>
Thats how kids become orphans, YOU LOST YOUR MIND!?<br/>
I keep my enemies close<br/>
I give 'em enough rope<br/>
They put themselves in the air<br/>
I just kick away the chair<br/>
<br/>
UH <br/>
UH <br/>
We gon' see now <br/>
UH HUH <br/>
We gon' see clown <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Go 'head, burry yourself <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Go 'head, Burry yourself <br/>
<br/>
Hov gon' get you, I aint forget your little disrespect<br/>
NO Hov, daddy gon' spank your for that shit you said<br/>
It's hard to do, when you got nothin to prove<br/>
Everbody know you better, you in a lose lose<br/>
Even if you win, ultimately you lose<br/>
Real niggahz like, "why Hov talkin to dude"<br/>
He's sellin low too<br/>
Only time you went plat<br/>
My chain was around yout neck, thats an actual fact<br/>
So I'm praying that it spills outside of the Booth<br/>
Thats when y'all niggahz outside of your truth<br/>
Outside of your league, thats not what you do<br/>
Niggahz throwing ROC signs outside of your coupe<br/>
<i>[Laughs]</i><br/>
Dun look at Hove like he dun somethin wrong to em<br/>
He just took what belong to em<br/>
Niggahz playing Checkers wid Chess playing Hov<br/>
This game is over I dunno if y'all know<br/>
You in a hole<br/>
<br/>
We gon' see now <br/>
Uh Huh <br/>
We gon' see clown <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Go 'head, burry yourself <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Dig a hole <br/>
Go 'head, burry yourself
