"Man I worked for one of the biggest companies in New York City.<br/>
He didn't own his own company. White man owned it, so they owned him. Nobody owns me though."<br/>
<br/>
(Your gangster is not defined) <br/>
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand over his expectations. Never forget where you came from.  <br/>
(Your gangster)<br/>
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch, but rather how many rocks you move while on your watch.<br/>
(Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes.)<br/>
Conservatives, labor, the seller, the buyer, the product, the producer.<br/>
(See you are what you are in this world.)<br/>
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern gangsterment. <br/>
(Gangsterment)<br/>
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws and create brand new words.<br/>
Gangster mentality.<br/>
(Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white, mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends, taxed by the governmentality, charted by forbes.<br/>
If you believe in Jay-Z then you too can be a gangster.)<br/>
The you too can be a gangster by any means necessary. By any means necessary, by owning that dream. I mean it's a long walk to freedom but, while deep,<br/>
deep, deep inside the bush.<br/>
(The war on terror screams, damn it feels good)<br/>
Damn it feels good to be a gangster.<br/>
(To be a gangster swagger is not a must, it's a liability, a cliche, a bad suit, cut the bullshit. You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that.)<br/>
Which we call, the American Gangster.
