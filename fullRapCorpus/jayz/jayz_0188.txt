<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I got these niggas breezy, don't worry about it<br/>
Let that bitch breathe!<br/>
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less<br/>
What do I think of success<br/>
It sucks too much to stress<br/>
I guess I blew up quick, cause friends I grew up with <br/>
See me as a primi, but I'm not and my nut's big<br/>
I don't know what the fuss is<br/>
My career is illustrious<br/>
My rep is impeccable<br/>
I'm not to be fucked with, with shit<br/>
Let that bitch breathe!<br/>
I'm way too important to be talking extorting<br/>
Asking me for a portion is like asking me for a coffin<br/>
Broad daylight I off ya on switch<br/>
Ya not too bright, goodnight, long kiss, <br/>
Bye-bye, my reply, blah-blah<br/>
Blast burner then pass burner, to TyTy<br/>
Finish my breakfast, why?<br/>
I got an appettite for destruction and you're a small fry<br/>
Now where was I<br/>
Let that bitch breathe!<br/>
I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more<br/>
Truth be told, I had more fun when I was piss poor<br/>
I'm pissed off, is this what success all about<br/>
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths<br/>
All this stress, all I got is this big house<br/>
Couple cars, I don't bring half of them shits out<br/>
All this ace of spade I drank, just to piss out<br/>
I mean I like the taste, could have saved myself six hours<br/>
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu<br/>
Hold up, let me move my bowels<br/>
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG tell these boys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juan:]</i><br/>
Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I got watches I ain't seen in months<br/>
Apartment at the Trump I only slept in it once<br/>
Nigga said Hova was over, such dummies <br/>
Even if I fell I land on a bunch of money<br/>
Y'all ain't got nothing for me<br/>
Nas, let that bitch breathe!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Success, McLaren, women starin'<br/>
My villain appearance<br/>
Sacred blood of a king<br/>
In my vein ain't spillin'<br/>
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill, Romero<br/>
Camaro driven<br/>
I climax from paper then ask why is life worth livin'<br/>
Is it the hunt for the shit that you want<br/>
To receive is great but I lust giving<br/>
The best jewelers want to make my things<br/>
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine, just to make me a chain<br/>
Niggas mention of one love, came home to paper in hand<br/>
Ain't got to brag about the feds young man<br/>
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments<br/>
Google Earth Nas, I got flats in other continents<br/>
Worst enemies want to be my best friends<br/>
Best friends want to be enemies, like that's what's in<br/>
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den<br/>
Take everybody's chips, about to cash them in<br/>
Up your catalogue dog, mines worth too much<br/>
Like Mike Jack's ATV Pub, Mottola can't touch<br/>
Let this bitch breathe!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z &amp; Nas:]</i><br/>
Let this bitch breathe!
