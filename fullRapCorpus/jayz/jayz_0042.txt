ÏðèâUh uh<br/>
So So Def<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri]</i><br/>
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes<br/>
With the top down screamin out<br/>
Money ain't a thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings<br/>
With the window cracked, holler back<br/>
Money ain't a thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri]</i><br/>
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean<br/>
And to hell with the price<br/>
cause the money ain't a thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang<br/>
When you hit the bricks, new whips<br/>
Money ain't a thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri]</i><br/>
Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us<br/>
Cause all across the ball we burn it up<br/>
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up<br/>
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up<br/>
See the money ain't a thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I flex the rol', sign a check for yo' hoe<br/>
Jigga's style is love, X and O<br/>
Save all your accolades, just the dough<br/>
My game is wide, all lames aside<br/>
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet<br/>
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye<br/>
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky<br/>
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it<br/>
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young<br/>
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up<br/>
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'<br/>
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up<br/>
Multi til I close up, it's all basic<br/>
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces<br/>
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas<br/>
Me and Jermaine Dupri got it locked crazy<br/>
Where you at haters?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri]</i><br/>
My cake thick, I live the life<br/>
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night<br/>
I make the big moves, do the big things<br/>
Take small groups, turn them into big names<br/>
The big dog with the big chain, frost bit bracelet to match<br/>
Cats say I'm the shit man<br/>
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew<br/>
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do<br/>
Get more burnt than a candle<br/>
Too hot to hold, too much to handle<br/>
In the black C-low, he know if she look<br/>
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no more<br/>
I'm the truth like A.I., got the proof and stay fly<br/>
In the safest shit you could never buy<br/>
Know why? Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing<br/>
I don't know bout y'all but every night I swing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'<br/>
And ya hit a R&amp;B chick and she fit the bill<br/>
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin<br/>
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction<br/>
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you owed some<br/>
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey<br/>
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day<br/>
What's down is a bet, roll the dice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jermaine Dupri]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, so let's play <br/>
So what, you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel<br/>
It's gonna take a lot more to see my level<br/>
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that<br/>
And personally your raps is where the trouble at<br/>
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain<br/>
In the platinum frame screaming it's not a game<br/>
Gleaming, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain<br/>
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
So So Def, Roc-A-Fella, collabo'<br/>
You know, all we do is rock<br/>
Rock on
