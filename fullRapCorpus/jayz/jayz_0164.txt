<i>[Intro (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)]</i><br/>
I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P.<br/>
Without the boy H.O.V. (I will be, I will be)<br/>
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)<br/>
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)<br/>
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)<br/>
When kingdom come, I'm ready (I will be)<br/>
When kingdom come (Yeah, yeah) I'm ready<br/>
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back<br/>
Up out the corner office out the coldasack<br/>
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat<br/>
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at<br/>
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap<br/>
But despite that the boy is back<br/>
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved<br/>
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge<br/>
I'm C.E.O. and yeah going god<br/>
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded<br/>
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart<br/>
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark<br/>
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark<br/>
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart<br/>
I - take off the blazer loosen up the tie<br/>
Step inside the booth Superman is alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)]</i><br/>
(I will be) The King Of New York (I will be) New York<br/>
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)<br/>
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)<br/>
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)<br/>
When kingdom come, uh huh (I will be)<br/>
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
So after this flow you might owe me a favor<br/>
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I hear "hurry up Hov" when I'm out in the public<br/>
Cause niggas like it, you love it; We be it, you're of it<br/>
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas<br/>
Had to dust off the Hammer, dance - can't touch this<br/>
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out<br/>
Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out<br/>
Got 'em dancing on the bankhead, like they from Bankhead<br/>
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking<br/>
I thought dudes remark was rude okay<br/>
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Ros√©<br/>
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know<br/>
But I first had to take care of the world I know<br/>
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel em from the bottom<br/>
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him<br/>
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark<br/>
Peter Park, Spiderman, all I do is climb the charts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)]</i><br/>
(I will be) The King Of New York (I will be) New York<br/>
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)<br/>
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)<br/>
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)<br/>
When kingdom come, uh huh (I will be)<br/>
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
So after this flow you might owe me a favor<br/>
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Just when they thought it was all over<br/>
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders<br/>
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that<br/>
Guess what New York, New York - we back<br/>
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought<br/>
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down south<br/>
Bout it, bout it, Master P<br/>
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homey Bun B<br/>
I run the streets the streets don't run we<br/>
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep<br/>
I repeat, sing a long with me<br/>
I run the streets the streets don't run we<br/>
Ladies saying where you been Superman?<br/>
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands<br/>
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear<br/>
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)]</i><br/>

So after this flow you might owe me a favor<br/>
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)
