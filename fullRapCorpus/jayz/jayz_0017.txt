<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Peep the scripts<br/>
Gold honey from the whips<br/>
Jumped out like YO! <br/>
Who the fuck you with<br/>
Flash the juice 'cause that's the rule<br/>
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes ***<br/>
Natural - Can I get at you?<br/>
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo<br/>
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun<br/>
I Didn't Know how many niggas was humping hon<br/>
I said I never seen a face like yours before<br/>
And I been around some cute whores before<br/>
That either me or my boys tore it up before<br/>
So I'm hoping you different <br/>
Let you push the 6<br/>
And give you a different life and<br/>
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning<br/>
And ride it 'til the night<br/>
Want to buy you real jury when it hits the light<br/>
Bitches are momentarily lose they sight<br/>
She said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I know what boys like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
I know what boys like, boys like<br/>
I know what boys like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
I know what boys like, boys like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Lil' Kim]</i><br/>
So want a cutie with a booty like OW!<br/>
Deeper than the MOW!<br/>
Airy Shine like TADOW!<br/>
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things<br/>
Only real bitches live like queens - Get it?<br/>
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet<br/>
Marvel Forts is for matching Rolls Royce's<br/>
In the driveway from Monday to Friday<br/>
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches<br/>
While chickens cluck giving up the butt<br/>
I blaze the cut with the daddy raw buff<br/>
You can call me a slut<br/>
Who gives a fuck<br/>
That's fine nigga shit<br/>
I'm a good with mine<br/>
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want<br/>
Fuck a prenup give me half up front<br/>
My sex be the best so we split these costs<br/>
You can stop saying mine<br/>
And start saying ours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I know what girls like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
They want to sex me<br/>
They think I'm sexy<br/>
I know what girls like, girls like me<br/>
<br/>
I know what boys like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
They want to sex me<br/>
They think I'm sexy<br/>
I know what boys like, boys like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze<br/>
Victoria Secret lingerie<br/>
Ice like Don King <br/>
The price was like 8 digits a long way, shit<br/>
Got the beachfront view<br/>
V1 too<br/>
Cop you one cop me one too<br/>
On the place, jetski's park by the lake<br/>
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make<br/>
Invite your friends over<br/>
Better make their way through <br/>
The Benz's and the Rovers before they reach the door<br/>
Vacate, hey wait, a week or more<br/>
First class to and fro, freakin off<br/>
Got the ham things lot<br/>
Champaigne popped<br/>
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop<br/>
Cop rembrandt, handle, pay the lot<br/>
Can't complain, we balling, true or not?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2x]</i><br/>
I know what girls like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
I know what girls like, girls like<br/>
I know what girls like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
I know what girls like, girls like me<br/>
<br/>
I know what boys like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
I know what boys like, boys like<br/>
I know what boys like<br/>
I know what they want<br/>
I know what boys like, boys like me
