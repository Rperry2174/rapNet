<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Just let me great, just let me great<br/>
I feel like mothafuckin' Cassius Clay right now, Genius!<br/>
Don't be good my nigga, be great<br/>
After that government cheese, we eating steak<br/>
After the projects, now we on estates<br/>
I'm from the bottom, I know y'all can relate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Fuck up the world<br/>
Let's fuck up this world<br/>
Fuck up the world<br/>
Me and destiny got a date<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Martin had a dream, Hov gotta team<br/>
My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring<br/>
Parades down Flatbush, Confetti on my fur<br/>
Turn right on Red Hook, niggas heavy on the curve<br/>
See most of my niggas died early twenties or late teens<br/>
I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime<br/>
1% of a billion more then niggas even seen<br/>
Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold<br/>
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl<br/>
Came thru Pasadena in the low low<br/>
Just to show respect to the chulos<br/>
Feel like a stranger in my own land<br/>
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland<br/>
I just want my shot to show my genius<br/>
Standing on the top hold my penis<br/>
America tried to emasculate the greats<br/>
Murder Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes<br/>
Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble<br/>
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble<br/>
You know I'm gon shine like a trillion watts<br/>
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks<br/>
Send a light to Compton and the hundred blocks<br/>
Lil bastard boy, basking on top<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Sipping D'USSE boy this ain't your daddy yak<br/>
He in a Cadillac; me? I'm in the Maybach<br/>
This ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks<br/>
This is black leather pants and a pair of stance<br/>
Socks is my synopsis is clear<br/>
Got stripclubs feeling like Oxford, I swear<br/>
Teacher teacher, I trying to unteach ya<br/>
All the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers<br/>
When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees<br/>
You front row every where, you in the H.O.V's<br/>
Jordan 1's and dungarees<br/>
And that's just the half of my warpath<br/>
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million<br/>
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feeling<br/>
We have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top<br/>
Cause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop<br/>
<br/>
