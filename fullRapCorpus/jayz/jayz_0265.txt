And it says, now the works of the flesh are manifest<br/>
Meaning, the things that are in the sinful nature<br/>
They always come to the surface<br/>
And when they come, when they come to the surface<br/>
They come to the surface as demons<br/>
<br/>
(All this work can pay off)<br/>
I just want all this work to pay off<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Don't calculate us<br/>
(Get to know you later)<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Alcohol in my room<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I am not poison, no I am not poison<br/>
Just a boy from the hood that<br/>
Got my hands in the air<br/>
In despair don't shoot<br/>
I just wanna do good, ah<br/>
I am not poison, no I am not poison<br/>
Just a boy from the hood that<br/>
Got my hands in the air<br/>
In despair don't shoot<br/>
I just wanna do good, uh<br/>
<br/>
Pray your father's father wasn't touching his little daughter<br/>
Creating trans-generational trauma, that shit'll haunt ya<br/>
Pray your little cousin ain't fall from the place that you fall asleep<br/>
Of course it's harmful (no high)<br/>
Nigga ain't dozed, I ain't washed in a week<br/>
I ain't changed clothes 'til the Black Album<br/>
Y'all rap about it, I'm wrestlin' in these streets<br/>
'Til I tapped out 'em, them niggas is WWE<br/>
Y'all can have that, I'm smack dab<br/>
In a hurricane of emotions<br/>
Can't even raise my little daughter, my little Carter<br/>
We call her Blue cause it's sad that<br/>
How can I be a dad that, I never had that<br/>
Shattered in a million pieces, where the glass at<br/>
I need a drink, shrink or something<br/>
I need an angelic voice to sing something<br/>
Bless my soul, extend your arms, I'm cold<br/>
Hold me for a half hour until I am whole, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I am not poison, no I am not poison<br/>
Just a boy from the hood that<br/>
Got my hands in the air<br/>
In despair, don't shoot<br/>
I just wanna good, ah<br/>
Alcohol in my room<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Sick of hiding in holes and behind hyperbole<br/>
This is the real me unfold<br/>
Gangster is love, I'm thuggin', I'm huggin'<br/>
This is tougher than any gun that I raised<br/>
Any crack that I blazed, that was nothin'<br/>
Peeling back the layers, uncovering<br/>
Scars that never healed, I never kept it this real<br/>
I acted out, my life a stage, ten thousand people watchin'<br/>
Where's the little boy I knew?<br/>
I must have forgot him<br/>
Stuntin', of course we never grew<br/>
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you<br/>
Stuntin', of course we never grew<br/>
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song... you<br/>
<br/>
I am not poison, no I am not poison<br/>
Just a boy from the hood that<br/>
Got my hands in the air<br/>
In despair don't shoot<br/>
I just wanna good, ah<br/>
I am not poison, no I am not poison<br/>
Just a boy from the hood that<br/>
Got my hands in the air<br/>
In despair don't shoot<br/>
I just wanna do good, uh<br/>
Alcohol in my room<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not poison<br/>
(Just don't calculate us)<br/>
Spiritual, yes it is spiritual<br/>
No I'm not poison, no I'm not...
