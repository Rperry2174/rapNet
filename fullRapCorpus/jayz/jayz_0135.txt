<i>[Intro: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, uh, your boy is back<br/>
(Sexy sexy) I know y'all miss the bounce<br/>
Need to bounce for the sexy you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah ma, your dude is back, Maybach coupe is back<br/>
Tell the whole world the truth is back<br/>
You ain't got to argue about who could rap<br/>
Cause the proof is back just go through my rap<br/>
New York New York yeah where my troopers at<br/>
Where my hustlers where my boosters at<br/>
I don't care what you do for stacks<br/>
I know the world glued you back to the wall<br/>
You gotta brawl to that <br/>
I been through that, been shot at shoot back<br/>
Gotta keep it peace like a Buddhist<br/>
I ain't a New Jack nobody 'gon Wesley Snipe me<br/>
It's less than likely, move back<br/>
Let I breathe Jedi knight<br/>
The more space I get the better I write<br/>
(Oh) Never I write, but, if, ever I write<br/>
I need the space to say whatever I like, now just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
(Change clothes and go) You know I stay, fresh to death I brought you from the projects<br/>
And I'm a take you to the top of the globe so let's go (Change numbers and go)<br/>
Uh huh yeah, uh (Now girl I promise you, no substitute) It's just me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
And I 'gon tell you again let's get ghost in the phantom<br/>
You could bring your friend we could make this a tandem<br/>
You could come by yourself and you could stand him<br/>
Best believe I sweat out weaves, give afropuffs like R.A.G.E.<br/>
Awww you get If you could move it<br/>
Back it on up like a U Haul truck<br/>
Then run and tell them thugs you heard Hovi knew<br/>
He and the boy Phareal make beautiful music<br/>
He is to the east coast what Snoop is, to the west coast what Face is to Houston<br/>
Young Hov in the house it's so necessary<br/>
No bra with the blouse it's so necessary<br/>
No panties and jeans that's so necessary<br/>
Now why you fronting on me is that necessary<br/>
Do I to you look like a lame<br/>
Who don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game<br/>
Whose up on Dot Dot Dot and Vera Wang<br/>
Ma are you insane, let's just<br/>
(Woman speaking: What you want me to do?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
(Change clothes and go) You know I stay, fresh to death I brought you from the projects<br/>
And I'm a take you to the top of the globe so let's go (Change numbers and go)<br/>
Uh huh yeah, uh (Now girl I promise you, no substitute) It's just me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
Uh, uh (Sexy sexy) Woo! (Ah ah!!!)<br/>

Uh huh, woo! (Sexy sexy) That's right it's a groove (Ah ah!!!)<br/>
Uh huh, it's a groove (Sexy sexy) bring it back (Ah ah!!!!)<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Young Hovi in the house it's so necessary<br/>
No bra with that blouse it's so necessary<br/>
No panties and jeans it's so necessary<br/>
Why you fronting on me?<br/>
Let's go to my hotel cause this don't go well<br/>
With those S Dots, try to stay fresh ma<br/>
Ma, I don't shop what the rest by<br/>
Oh no ma please respect ma<br/>
Jiggy this is probably purple label<br/>
Or that BBC or it's probably tailored<br/>
But y'all niggas acting way to tough<br/>
Throw on a suit get it tapered up, and let's just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
(Change clothes and go) You know I stay, fresh to death I brought you from the projects<br/>
And I'm a take you to the top of the globe so let's go (Change numbers and go)<br/>
Uh huh yeah, uh (Now girl I promise you, no substitute) It's just me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
