<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Whooo! Whooo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Memph Bleek always smoking that La, La, La<br/>
Beanie Sigel always smoking that La, La, La<br/>
Neptunes track smoke like La, La, La<br/>
It's the ROC baby sing our Lulla-Bye (C'mon)<br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singing let's get right tonight<br/>
Mami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I know my English ain't as modest as you like<br/>
But come, get some you little bums<br/>
I take the cake from under the bakers thumb<br/>
I bake the cake and two it up from one<br/>
Then I moved to weight like I'm Oprah's son<br/>
Uh, I show you how to do this son<br/>
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry Patterns<br/>
Fake Menolo's boots straight from Steve Madden<br/>
He tatted his-self, as the rap J.F.K.<br/>
You wanna pass for my Jaqueline, Onassis, then<br/>
Hop ya ass out that S-Class<br/>
Lay back in the Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask<br/>
Have you in your long-legged life<br/>
Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice<br/>
Look but don't touch, muthafucka think twice<br/>
Cuz this gat that I clutch gotta little red light<br/>
Need a light?<br/>
<br/>
(To smoke that La, La, La)<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
Beanie Sigel always smoking that La, La, La<br/>
Memph Bleek always smoking that La, La, La<br/>
It's the ROC mami sing our Lulla-Bye<br/>
C'mon<br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singing let's get right tonight<br/>
Mami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
We got brothers full of Army, Mami's in Manolo<br/>
Bags by Chanel or Louis Vuitton logo's<br/>
All attracted to Hov because they know dough<br/>
When they see him, whips be European<br/>
If your a 10 chances your with him<br/>
If your a 5 you know you ridin' with them<br/>
Sick with the pen nigga no physician, in the world could fix him<br/>
No prescription, you can prescribe to subside his affliction<br/>
He's not a sane man, he's more like the Rainman twitchin'<br/>
You can't Reign Dance on this picnic<br/>
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chicken<br/>
Can dead or sickness, no Quiji board<br/>
You can't see me dawg, niggaz ya CB-4<br/>
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the ROC bitch<br/>
And I'm the Franchise like the Houston Rockets<br/>
Yao Ming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3]</i><br/>
Still smokin' that La, La, La<br/>
Memph Bleek still smokin' that La, La, La<br/>
Beanie Sigel Desert Eagle the .45<br/>
It's the ROC baby sing our Lulla-Bye<br/>
C'mon<br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singing let's get right tonight<br/>
Mami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Forget English, talk body language<br/>
I be all over mami's like body painters<br/>
Pink Diamond necklace, strawberry wrist<br/>
Please excuse yourself, your very sick<br/>
Don't confuse me with Marbury out this bitch<br/>
Run up on me at the light, you could lose your life<br/>
Muthafucka's must be smokin' they La, La, La or crack<br/>
.45 gun smoke, choke off that<br/>
Let's get back to the music, I ain't with all that<br/>
Plus the fedz tappin' my music, yall get all that?<br/>
I'm THEE! public industry #1<br/>
Public industry #2 is my whole crew (R.O.C.!)<br/>
Now I ain't down with who like me or who like you<br/>
That's gay, I ain't into liking dudes no way<br/>
But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future<br/>
I never make the news again, my man'll shoot ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3]</i><br/>
As we, smoke that La, La, La<br/>
Memph Bleek still smokin' that La, La, La<br/>
Beanie Sigel Desert Eagle the .45<br/>
It's the ROC bitch sing our Lulla-Bye<br/>
C'mon<br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singing let's get right tonight<br/>
Mami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell Williams {of the Neptunes}]</i><br/>
Well watch me now<br/>
Uh!<br/>
Ho!, Ho!<br/>
C'mon<br/>
Do you want me to do it<br/>
Well watch me now
