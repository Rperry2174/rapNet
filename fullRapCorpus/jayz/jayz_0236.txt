<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, Renegades is back<br/>
Em the B the sick<br/>
It's Young, Freeway, 8 Miles, let's go<br/>
<br/>
8 miles and running, got my 7th album droppin'<br/>
And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs<br/>
But I can rewind the calendar back, back when it was now or nothin'<br/>
People said I would amount to nothin', that I had talent for nothin'<br/>
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by your gunmen<br/>
I could just hear the folks now, "He got what he had coming"<br/>
Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smilin'<br/>
Wantin' something, claimin' that they done something for him<br/>
Got their Jay-Z pom poms and their whole uniform<br/>
Claimin' they been runnin' and tellin' everybody like Martin Lawerence<br/>
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was<br/>
Claimin' that they threw it up before I threw it up<br/>
You what? Where was you before I blew this up?<br/>
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us<br/>
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up<br/>
Back on the block, gettin' it in, there wasn't no you with us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
8 miles and running, got my 7th album droppin'<br/>
And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs, Free<br/>
<i>[Freeway]</i><br/>
6 miles and running, got my fist strip poppin'<br/>
And my first album comin', feedin' twenty growlin' stomachs<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
8 miles and running, got my 7th album droppin'<br/>
And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs, Free<br/>
<i>[Freeway]</i><br/>
6 miles and running, got my fist strip poppin'<br/>
And my first album comin', feedin' twenty growlin' stomachs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Freeway]</i><br/>
6 miles and running in the Pontiac<br/>
Six thousand eighty six, trans might shift while the engine run<br/>
Anyone tell ya rider give me one more chance<br/>
Hear them smokers screamin' "One more gram"<br/>
So I'ma bring 'em one<br/>
Homie, son, and my pop, stick close to my MOMMA<br/>
Keep toasters for DRAMA, mix a lot with my son<br/>
My son growin' and he learnin' a lot<br/>
That's when them toasters will the burners will pop, brain on ya own<br/>
Well a nigga, tell 'em niggas<br/>
That's like the biblical scripture<br/>
Look back, turn assault like the sin is in<br/>
Most of ya heartless and self-centered like "Me Shaq and me Shaq"<br/>
Set up ya brother cuz you jealous nigga<br/>
The heat back, like you never left<br/>
I ever rep, cops watch every step<br/>
Six miles and running dodgin' every trap<br/>
The rap gingerbread man, cheer us up<br/>
You precious breath, State P the second attack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Back when nobody would found he had talent, nobody would sign me<br/>
Nobody believed in me, nobody but mommy blindly<br/>
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt<br/>
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothin' but love for me<br/>
When niggas would want me, the industry shunned me<br/>
That's why I'm takin' all the industry's money<br/>
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this<br/>
Young is the illsest, Free is the future<br/>
Bean's and Bleek is right now, we can see our 8 miles nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
