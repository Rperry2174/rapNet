<i>[Intro: Sizzla]</i><br/>
They can't keep a gooda man down<br/>
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns<br/>
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds<br/>
They will never ever take my crown<br/>
Who Jah bless I say no man curse<br/>
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse<br/>
Here comes the officers askin' for a search<br/>
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You in the presence of a king<br/>
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God<br/>
Put in the belly of the beast<br/>
I escaped, a nigga never had a job<br/>
Scott Boras, you over baby<br/>
Robinson Cano, you coming with me<br/>
These niggas is like rotary phones<br/>
It's a new day, hit up KD<br/>
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down<br/>
Knock me to my knees about a million times<br/>
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records<br/>
I sold a million records like a million times<br/>
These niggas shouldn't let me in<br/>
I ball so hard on ESPN<br/>
See my name come across on CNN<br/>
'Bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again<br/>
'Bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x: Travi$ Scott]</i><br/>
Shit on me<br/>
These niggas tried to shit on me<br/>
I was left for dead<br/>
They tried to wipe me out of your history<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope<br/>
Bulletproof love, Niggas down since the yolk<br/>
Bitch asked if I was God<br/>
Fuck I'm supposed to say, "no"<br/>
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T.<br/>
You already know what I could do with the coke<br/>
Drop it in the water, made it disappear<br/>
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope<br/>
I make my roof get ghost<br/>
Bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold<br/>
All the shit did, I wasn't supposed to live<br/>
Hallelujah Hov<br/>
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able<br/>
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead<br/>
Best friends become ya enemies<br/>
Niggas' knives are double-edged<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i>
