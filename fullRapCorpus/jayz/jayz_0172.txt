I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)<br/>
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)<br/>
<br/>
When the singer Rob calls the police on me y'all niggaz ran out and copped the CD<br/>
see what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody<br/>
see What Doug, Jimmy &amp; L.A. don't know, these youngins crossed the line with Hov, I'm letting it blow<br/>
had the papers writing stories like: "didn't they know, this what happen when they made that rapper CEO"<br/>
I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate start to overflow then the leavey breaks<br/>
and my conscience go, you escape the rico, why throw everything away over ego?<br/>
you paper chasing, they paper hating, billionaire Hov you on the pace to make it<br/>
fuck that exclamation comma quotations I love drama period<br/>
<br/>
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)<br/>
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)<br/>
<br/>
smelling like Petrone singing dirty rap songs, tip-toeing in the crib like 6 in the morn<br/>
every day its the same I said in blueprint that I'd never change its just a part of the game<br/>
respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec but expect me to bug its in my blood<br/>
but if my chick leave me she gonna leave me for something, she gone leave me cause Halie,<br/>
she ain't gonna leave me for nothing, picture me getting up with something sleazy<br/>
something something so easy you could take out its beat like nothing something<br/>
soon as you finish cutting you like leave me please, not me I need Angelina Joli's company,<br/>
so I ain't gonna make a move unless I got I got a plan b, that'll happen the day i have a baby by free,<br/>
not to say that anything is wrong with free, just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me<br/>
If my hands in the cookie jar, know one thing, ima take the cookie not leave my ring<br/>
if my hands in the cookie jar know one thing ima take (laughs) y'all know what I mean<br/>
<br/>
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)<br/>
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)<br/>
<br/>

go somewhere and play, cause the day I loose to you little niggaz, no day<br/>

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)<br/>
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end we're all the same (all the same)<br/>
I pray to god, father forgive a nigga I'm never gonna change (gonna change)
