<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, put our hands together for the astonishing...<br/>
<br/>
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world<br/>
The flow o' the century...always timeless...HOVE!<br/>

<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA<br/>
Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins<br/>
Got it dirt cheap for them<br/>
Plus if they was short wit' cheese I would work wit' them<br/>
Boy and we...got rid of that dirt for them<br/>
Wasn't born hustlers I was burpin' em<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy<br/>
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me<br/>
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy<br/>
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in<br/>
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me<br/>
Therefore he doesn't exist<br/>
So poof...vamoose son of a bitch<br/>
<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
Not guilty ya'll got-ta feel me<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
<br/>
Yo, It starts with<br/>
One thing, I don't know why<br/>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br/>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br/>
To explain in due time<br/>
All I know<br/>
time is a valuable thing<br/>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br/>
Watch it count down to the end of the day<br/>
The clock ticks life away<br/>
It's so unreal<br/>
I Didn't look out below<br/>
I Watch the time go right out the window<br/>
Trying to hold on, and didn't even know<br/>
Wasted it all just to<br/>
Watch you go<br/>
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart<br/>
What it meant to me, will eventually, be a memory, of a time when I tried so<br/>
<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
LP, Jay-Z, help me out<br/>
Oh, they havin' a good o' time out there<br/>
It starts with<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
LP, Jay-Z, help me out<br/>
Oh, they havin' a good o' time out there<br/>
It starts with<br/>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<br/>
LP, Jay-Z, help me out<br/>
Ladies and Gentalmen<br/>
It starts with
