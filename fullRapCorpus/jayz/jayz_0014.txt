<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Geyeah, y'all nigaas finished yo<br/>
Is y'all niggas finished<br/>
Got your little radio play your little BDS, huh<br/>
You finished nigga, huh huh, y'all finished<br/>
Can I live, huh<br/>
Can I live, Joe your bein' stingy with the music bin yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yo, yo...yo, I blacks out, I pulls the mack out<br/>
Scream "Whats that about," then I clap out<br/>
I get my plot on, in my drop on<br/>
Through the rotten, dont even hate on those who hate me<br/>
I got popped on, feelin' it (feelin' it)<br/>
Chickens are ice grillin' it<br/>
Cops pullin' it over, Jigga react militant<br/>
Speed off, officer told me to turn the beat off<br/>
I turned it a level higher, then return the devils fire<br/>
I'm raised different, reactin' situations<br/>
Niggas lay stiff and, rookies blame it on the age difference<br/>
My subliminal flows create criminal O's<br/>
Sing along if you with me, til the end of the road<br/>
I'm cynical when in the view of the public<br/>
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews<br/>
The percentage who dont understand is higher than the percentage who do<br/>
Check yourself, what percentage is you?<br/>
<br/>
Can I live<br/>
For all my niggas with all white airforce ones and black guns, stack ones yo<br/>
Can I live <br/>
For all my chicks, pigeons, hoes stand bow legged like the bulldog, know what <br/>
I mean, huh?<br/>
Can I live<br/>
To all the ce-lo champs, two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll <br/>
heads yo<br/>
Can I live<br/>
To all my niggas who drink hennesy straight, cop mix tapes, and sell weight <br/>
niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I got the feds sending me letters 'cause Im schooling the youth<br/>
But they cant lock me down 'cause my tool is the truth<br/>
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, thats a given<br/>
Why is it? why dont y'all try to visit the neighboorhoods I lived in<br/>
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central<br/>
Where cops lock you more than try to defend you<br/>
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth<br/>
And all I see is life cycle just repeatin' itself<br/>
Ran into shorty boppin' down the ave<br/>
On his way to clockin' mad then<br/>
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Aiyyo theres money I there I just gotta have<br/>
When I catch up to these feinds Im'a knock 'em on they ass<br/>
Not to brag, sometimes I look at life and laugh<br/>
How I think about school and it taught me not a ???<br/>
When I backed out, let one one, let the barrel turn<br/>
Holla at you faggots that its my block to burn<br/>
That credit you dead it, I know heads gettin' annoyed and knew all<br/>
About a dope feind before reading donald goings<br/>
Flipping boying, using the right cut<br/>
One thing thats fucked up is bad dope that I cant pump<br/>
This slab gotta re-up and rebag, blend it in with the raw<br/>
Bubble it fast cop more, once I get it I got it I lock it<br/>
Nobody pop shit, selling twenties on my block bitch<br/>
For some blacktop shit<br/>
What you want nigga, what you want nigga<br/>
What you want, what you want nigga<br/>
<br/>
Can I live...<br/>
To all my niggas that hold coke and they bubble coat<br/>
Tryin' to win in the construction Timbs yo<br/>
Can I live...<br/>
Yo USA, all my chicks that strip, boo's, go to the store with the dewey pins <br/>
still in<br/>
All my chicks with the credit card scams, two kids, one job, and no man<br/>
All my chicks gettin' that washing set with their welfare check<br/>
All the mommies dame besa, alright?<br/>
All my niggas rockin' them fifty cats, tryin' to get at this rap<br/>
Know what I mean?<br/>
All my cats with open cases, big cars, and no licenses, I like that shit, <br/>
I'll see y'all<br/>
All my niggas at St. Pauls after they say some fucked up shit<br/>
Rock on and uh, Jigga shit, Rockafella forever yo<br/>
Uhh, Major Coins, yeah, uhh huh<br/>
Memph Bleek nigga
