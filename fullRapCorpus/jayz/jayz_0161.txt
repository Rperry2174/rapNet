If your havin girl problems i feel bad for you son<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
<br/>
Got Mike<br/>
He's got the rap patrol on the gat patrol<br/>
Foes that wanna make sure his casket's closed<br/>
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"<br/>
He's from the hood stupid what type of facts are those<br/>
If you grew up with holes in your zapitos<br/>
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin doe<br/>
So fuck critics you can kiss our whole asshole<br/>
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward<br/>
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show<br/>
They don't play out hits well we don't give a shit SO<br/>
All these mags try and use our ass<br/>
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads...fuckers<br/>
I don't know what you take us as<br/>
or understand the intellegence that Jay-Z has<br/>
I'm from rags to ritches nigga we ain't dumb<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
<br/>
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
<br/>
The year is '94 and in my trunk is raw<br/>
In my rear view mirror is the mother fuckin law<br/>
I got two choices yall pull over the car or<br/>
Bounce on the double put the pedal to the floor<br/>
Now i ain't tryin to see no highway chase with Jay<br/>
Plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case<br/>
So i...pull over to the side of the road<br/>
And i heard "Son do you know why i'm stoppin you for?"<br/>
Cause i'm young and i'm black and my hats real low<br/>
Do i look like a mind reader sir, i don't know<br/>
Am i under arrest or should i guess some mo?<br/>
"Well you was doin fifty five in a fifty four"<br/>
"Liscense and regestration and step out of the car"<br/>
"Are you carryin a weapon on you i know alot of you are"<br/>
I ain't steppin out of shit all my papers legit<br/>
"Do you mind if i look round the car a little bit?"<br/>
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back<br/>
And i know my rights so you gon' need a warrent for that<br/>
"Aren't you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something?"<br/>
"Or somebody important or somethin?"<br/>
Nah i ain't pass the bar but i know a little bit<br/>
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit<br/>
"Well see how smart you are when the K-9's come"<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
<br/>
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Now once upon a time not too long ago<br/>
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe<br/>
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy<br/>
But a pussy havin no God Damn sense, try and push me<br/>
I tried to inore him and talk to the Lord<br/>
Pray for him, cause some fools just love to perform<br/>
You know the type loud as a motor bike<br/>
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight<br/>
The only thing that's gonna happen is i'mma get to clappin<br/>
He and his boys gon be yappin to the captain<br/>
And there i go traped in the kit kat again<br/>
Back through the system with the riff raff again<br/>
Fiends on the floor scratchin again<br/>
Paparatzi's with they cameras snappin them<br/>
D.A. tred to give the nigga the shaft again<br/>
Half-a-mil for bail cause i'm African<br/>
All because ths fool was horrasin them<br/>
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccarin<br/>
But ain't nothin sweet 'bout how i hold my gun<br/>
I got 99 problems but this bitch ain't one<br/>
<br/>
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
<br/>
shut up when I'm talking to you<br/>
shut up, shut up, shut up<br/>
shut up when I'm talking to you<br/>
shut up, shut up, shut up<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to BREAK<br/>
<br/>
Everything you say to me<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
I need a little room to breathe<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
Everything you say to me<br/>
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
Hit me<br/>
I need a little room to breathe<br/>
I got 99 problems<br/>
And I'm about to <br/>
Break
