<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yo once a pimp gets threats<br/>
That's right, that's the - the that's, that's threats them<br/>
And I'm serious about mine, I'm so sin-surr<br/>
And I, nigga I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up<br/>
Put ya inside the mattress like drug money nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, I done told you niggaz<br/>
9 or 10 times stop fuckin with me<br/>
I done told you niggaz<br/>
9 albums, stop fuckin with me<br/>
I done told you niggaz<br/>
The 9 on me, stop fuckin with me<br/>
You niggaz must got 9 lives<br/>
9th wonder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya<br/>
Am I frightenin ya?  Shall I continue?<br/>
I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song<br/>
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along<br/>
Now it's a duet, and you wet, when you check out<br/>
the technique from the 2 tecs and I don't need two lips<br/>
To blow this like a trumpet you dumb shit<br/>
This is a un-usual musical I conductin<br/>
You lookin at the black Warren Buffett so all critics can duck sic<br/>
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it<br/>
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rylin me up<br/>
For three years, they had me peein out of a cup<br/>
Now they bout to free me up, whatchu think I'm gon' be, what?<br/>
Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred<br/>
I'm young black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but<br/>
You never had me like Christina Aguiler-y<br/>
But catch me down the Westside, drivin like Halle Berry<br/>
Or the FDR, in the seat of my car<br/>
Screamin out the sunroof death to y'all<br/>
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars<br/>
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head<br/>
The whole hood'll want ya, you startin to look like bread<br/>
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin bout Feds<br/>
Nigga them body-snatchers, nigga you heard what I said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin<br/>
Put your smarts on the side of your garment<br/>
Nigga stop fuckin with me<br/>
R. -- I. -- P.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
That's right there nigga, nigga I'm wild<br/>
Nigga I keep trash bags with me<br/>
Never know when you gotta dump a nigga out<br/>
This sin-surr, this some sin-surr SHIT right hurr!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Grown man I put hands on you<br/>
I dig a hole in the desert, they build The Sands on you<br/>
Lay out blueprint plans on you<br/>
We Rat Pack niggaz, let Sam tap dance on you<br/>
Then, I Sinatra shot ya God damn you<br/>
... I put the boy in the box like David Blaine<br/>
Let the audience watch, it ain't a thang<br/>
Y'all wish I was frontin, I George Bush the button<br/>
Front of all you in your car lift up your hood nigga run it<br/>
Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it<br/>
Your boy got the goods y'all don't want nuttin of it<br/>
Like, castor oil, I Castor Troy you<br/>
Change your face or the bullets change all that for you<br/>
... y'all niggaz is targets<br/>
Y'all garages for bullets, please don't make me park it<br/>
in your upper level, valet a couple strays<br/>
from the 38 special, nigga, God bless you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Yeah I'm threatening ya, YEAH I'm threatening ya!<br/>
Who you thank you dealin with?<br/>
They call me Threats, nigga I been makin threats<br/>
since I been in kindergarten nigga!<br/>
Huh, ask about me, see if you ain't heard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
When the gun is tucked, untucked, nigga you dies<br/>
like numchuks held by the Jet L-I<br/>
I'm the one, thus meanin no one must try<br/>
No two, no three, no four, know why?<br/>
Because one's four-five might blow yo' high<br/>
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God<br/>
It's a match made in heaven when I <i>[blaow]</i> 'splay the 7<br/>
Put you on the nigga news, UPN at 11<br/>
Where you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm<br/>
<i>[blaow blaow]</i> that I'm so sin-surr?<br/>
I'm especially Joe Pesci with a grin<br/>
I will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again<br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Whattup?  Motherfucker I keep three motherfuckers what?<br/>
Nigga I'll throw a Molotov cocktail through your momma's momma's house<br/>
Nigga what the - where everybody live!<br/>
Undercover nigga take your teeth out your mouth nigga<br/>
Chew your food up and put the shit back in your mouth nigga<br/>
and help you swallow<br/>
Nigga I take a mop handle off nigga<br/>
And sweep nigga - hold on, I'll be - nigga what?
