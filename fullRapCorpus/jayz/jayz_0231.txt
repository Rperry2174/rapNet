Yeah, got Lil Cos up here with me<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
We stuck in La La Land<br/>
Even when we win, we gon' lose<br/>
We got the same fuckin' flows<br/>
I don't know who is who<br/>
We got the same fuckin' watch<br/>
She don't got time to choose<br/>
We stuck in La La Land<br/>
We got the same fuckin' moves<br/>
<br/>
Y'all fuck the same fuckin' chicks<br/>
I'm in the skrt with ya..yeah, right<br/>
I'm the skrt with ya..cool story<br/>
I'm on the ch..'nough of this<br/>
Look, I know killers, you no killer, huh?<br/>
Bathing Ape maybe not a gorilla, huh?<br/>
Glorified seat filler, huh?<br/>
Stop walkin' around like y'all made Thriller, huh?<br/>
Fake Dracos all in the videos<br/>
We sure we shoot 'em in my city though<br/>
I don't post no threats on the Internet<br/>
I just pose a threat, blame Lenny S for that<br/>
I don't be on the 'Gram goin' ham<br/>
Givin' information to the pork, that's all spam<br/>
Please don't talk about guns<br/>
That you ain't never gon' use<br/>
Y'all always tell on y'all self<br/>
I'm just so fuckin' confused<br/>
<br/>
Y'all stuck in La La Land<br/>
Even when we win, we gon' lose<br/>
Y'all got the same fuckin' flows<br/>
I don't know who is who<br/>
We got the same fuckin' watch<br/>
She don't got time to choose<br/>
We stuck in La La Land<br/>
We got the same fuckin' moves<br/>
<br/>
Y'all niggas still signin' deals? Still?<br/>
After all they done stole, for real?<br/>
After what they done to our Lauryn Hill?<br/>
And y'all niggas is 'posed to be trill?<br/>
That's real talk when you behind on your taxes<br/>
And you pawned all your chains<br/>
And they run off with your masters<br/>
And took it to Beverly Hills<br/>
While we in Calabasas<br/>
And my head is scratchin'<br/>
'Cause that shit is backwards<br/>
That shit ain't right<br/>
Lucian is cool but Lucian don't write<br/>
Doug ain't this tight, so<br/>
Fuck what we sellin'<br/>
Fuck is we makin'?<br/>
'Cause their grass is greener<br/>
'Cause they always rakin' in mo'<br/>
Nah, nah, nah...
