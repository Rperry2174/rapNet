Uh, uhh, uh<br/>
Uh, ah, now Hov's in the building, Hov's in the building<br/>
Uh, uhh, uh<br/>
Kels in the building, Kels in the building<br/>
Uh, uhh, that's right<br/>
Hov's in the building, Hov's in the building<br/>
Uh what? Ho, ho<br/>
Yo Kels in the building, Kels in the building<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
I'm in the building tonight, it's goin down my nigga<br/>
Got a pocket full of cash and some 'dro my nigga<br/>
Attitude like I don't give a fuck my nigga<br/>
Probably the drunkest fool on the flo' my nigga<br/>
One of the best that ever did this here, every year<br/>
It's the #1 R&amp;B singer this year<br/>
But y'all know, still mo' money mo' problems<br/>
Mo' niggaz, mo' chicks, mo' clubs, Mo' bottles<br/>
One little note in your ear, and I gotcha<br/>
Ladies call me the black Frank Sinatra<br/>
Yeah a real pimp floss and the pimp be blingin<br/>
It's just the same reason why a young pimp be leanin<br/>
Hard liquor, couple sips, and I'm passin it<br/>
Maybach so big you can dance in it<br/>
Jigga lil' nigga fuckin with the baddest chicks<br/>
Got your girl lookin at you like the maddest chick<br/>
We goin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
ho-ohh, ohh-oh<br/>
We got everybody up in the club, hands high<br/>
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh<br/>
We got players, ballers, hustlers and they back <br/>
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh<br/>
We got all of the pretty girls left in the city<br/>
goin ho-ohh, ohh-oh<br/>
We got 'em goin, we got 'em goin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yo yeah it's the boy Hov', yeah I blow O's<br/>
Circles around competition, not an Optimo<br/>
To sit low, in a six-oh, oh<br/>
Solo, on lo-lo's, fuck po'-po's<br/>
Take a pho-to, last time you see a nigga so cold<br/>
So be-low zero, so froze<br/>
So-so rappers are so sore, hate his soul<br/>
It ain't my fault I'm so rock'n'roll<br/>
I'm just Hov'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Geah, it's the kid from the Stuy, and I stay high<br/>
In my A-O-L-A blowin lah lah lah<br/>
Goodbye, I see you chumps on top<br/>
Or on the highway in somethin that ends with I<br/>
Like I, 745, I<br/>
Or the F-E-double-R-the-A-R-I<br/>
AR-15 to spray y'all guys<br/>
You die (you die) goodbye (goodbye)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
From New York to Chi, we blow like hy-dro<br/>
Blow out live shows without py-ro<br/>
See how I combined the I-O flow<br/>
Tone'll rep, Memph Bleek, Kels and Hov'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay and Bleek alternate words]</i><br/>
Bottles, models, follow, to the hotter<br/>
way we play like it's no day tomorrow<br/>
Spendin my dough like I just hit the lotto<br/>
Bounce, park and stop shall not wake I'm straight safe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
