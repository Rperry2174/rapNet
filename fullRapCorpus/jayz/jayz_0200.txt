<i>[Chorus: J. Cole (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i> <br/>
I seen Mase do it, I seen 'Ye do it <br/>
X came through, caught lighter fluid <br/>
Still I came through it, clap for 'em<br/>
But I'm the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em <br/>
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it, <br/>
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it <br/>
Wayne scorchin, I'll applaud him <br/>
If he keep goin, pass the torch to him<br/>
50 came through, like hurricanes do <br/>
I thought I finished his ass at Summerjam Two <br/>
I had the Illmatic, on bootleg <br/>
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead <br/>
Wayne did a milli, 50 did a milli<br/>
'Ye too but what Em did was silly <br/>
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him <br/>
His flow on "Renegade," fuckin awesome, applaud him <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J. Cole (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hey, Snoop Dogg did, Nelly came down<br/>
Facemob kept the ghetto for the H-Town<br/>
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches<br/>
Drake's up next, see what he do wit it<br/>
Rule had a run, couple movie parts<br/>
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts<br/>
Waddup Jeezy? What it do<br/>
Ya remind me of us in early '92<br/>
OutKast landed, 3 Thou' was ill<br/>
Like a male version, of Lauryn Hill<br/>
Mobb Deep (Shook) it, but Prodigy took it<br/>
a lil' too far, can't fuck wit Brooklyn<br/>
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate<br/>
Rae took on the date with the Purp' Tape<br/>
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface<br/>
They had a hell of a run, standing ova- aaaaaaaay!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J. Cole (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
And I am one, of one<br/>
Can't you see just how long my run?<br/>
My rain knew {?} sun-shine<br/>
Been a star since I was back in one, time<br/>
One time give it up for him<br/>
December 4th, a star was born<br/>
Clap for him, he went from movin that corner<br/>
to, this corner office, so enormous<br/>
Heeeeeeeey! Pres Carter<br/>
Watchin her get her Monica on all day<br/>
Heeeeeeeey!<br/>
...Got so many different Monicas, but only one Jay<br/>
They come, they go<br/>
Some real, some faux<br/>
Some friends, some hoes<br/>
But no I, goes nowhere, it's Hov<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J. Cole (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
Everyday a star is born!!!!  <br/>
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!!!!) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: J. Cole]</i><br/>
And could I be a star? <br/>
Does fame in this game have to change who you are? <br/>
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life<br/>
Just to make it in this broadway lights <br/>
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure <br/>
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville <br/>
Got a deal, a real life saver <br/>
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada <br/>
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later <br/>
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber <br/>
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov <br/>
He gave 'em a platform <br/>
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir <br/>
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes <br/>
When a broke nigga 'proaches <br/>
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in<br/>
Clap for him
