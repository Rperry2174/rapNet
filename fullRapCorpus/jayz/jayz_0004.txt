<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm feelin it fill the glass to the top with Moet<br/>
Feelin it feel the Lex pushin up on the set<br/>
I'm feelin it through the high that you get from the lie<br/>
Feelin it if you feel it raise your l in the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I keep it realer than most I know your feelin it<br/>
Cristal on ice I like to toast I keep on spillin it<br/>
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this<br/>
On my back the fliest clothes lookin ill and shit<br/>
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch <br/>
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick<br/>
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but <br/>
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher<br/>
We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up<br/>
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas wit some shit that a light they life up<br/>
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged<br/>
Nobody will fall cause everyone would be each others crutches <br/>
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it<br/>
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it<br/>
Jiggy jigger lookin gully in the joint <br/>
If y'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin <br/>
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin what shorty<br/>
(Where you disappear son?)<br/>
Maintainin puttin myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in<br/>
I'm livin the ill streets blues got you hunger painin<br/>
Nothin to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singin fool<br/>
I'm thorough in every boro my name be ringin<br/>
Warmin it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and <br/>
Ya Feelin it? to all the girls I bought the girdle to conceal my bricks<br/>
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit <br/>
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit<br/>
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit<br/>
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit <br/>
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit<br/>
These fake rappers cant really know I'm lovin it ya feelin it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
<br/>
What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay high? <br/>
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch<br/>
I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop <br/>
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot<br/>
Those nightmares mom<br/>
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills<br/>
But these mils make me hot y'all feel me<br/>
Enough to stop the illin right?<br/>
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight <br/>
I'm so confused<br/>
OK I'm gettin weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself<br/>
Look I don't need that now <br/>
It just once in a blue moon when there's nothin to do and<br/>
The tension's too thick for my sober mind to cut through<br/>
I get to zonin, me and the chick on the island and we're bonin'<br/>
I free my mind sometimes I here myself moanin<br/>
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone man<br/>
It got me goin shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i>
