<i>[Rell]</i><br/>
We're the ones with the flame (<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> "Yeah")<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Young Chris]</i><br/>
It's Young C (<i>[Neef:]</i> "Young C!")<br/>
Home of Philly, young and hungry<br/>
All the girlies wanna fall in lust with me<br/>
And every hood in the world discussin' me<br/>
I hated once when I didn't give it up to Neef<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Neef]</i><br/>
It's Neef Buck (<i>[Chris:]</i> "Neef Buck!")<br/>
Out the cut (<i>[Chris:]</i> "Out the cut!")<br/>
All the haters wanna claim that they fuck with us<br/>
It ain't a game, niggas know that they Toys R Us<br/>
They can't fuck with us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Chris]</i><br/>
AAAWWWWWW<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sparks]</i><br/>
I'm the one<br/>
Man I'm money, hoes, clothes and shows<br/>
To do with your ho all wrapped in one<br/>
I'm not done<br/>
Man, I'm the shit after its all said and done<br/>
The one to cop one, come back for another one<br/>
Quick fast, like rapid refund<br/>
I'm the grrrrrrr mean green out the money machine<br/>
I'm not done<br/>
I'm Omilio, and interviews thought you could hold Sparks in the hood<br/>

<i>[Young Chris]</i><br/>
All those haters talkin shit we don't like it<br/>

<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
We love it<br/>
That black mask, black glove shit<br/>
Roll up on him don't budge, bitch<br/>
With my mack, and my tech<br/>
And my vest, just like that<br/>
For them niggas thinkin' Mack Milli not really from the streets<br/>
I'm that gallstone trapped in the belly of the beast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rell]</i><br/>
Those seen here we'll lead you forever<br/>
And we will not leave you, never<br/>
And our voices will ring (<i>[Sparks:]</i> "rrriinngg") together<br/>
As one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Chris]</i><br/>
AAAWWWWW<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Freeway]</i><br/>
It's young Free<br/>
Move, workin' the wheel<br/>
Hand jerkin' the V<br/>
Busters don't let you crossed the line<br/>
Thinkin I'm off my job<br/>
But I'm on like Chris when he popped his cuz<br/>
Thinkin them slugs'll fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Call me P.C.<br/>
Tempers feelin', I peel<br/>
Look how I'm killin' the wheel<br/>
The fitted tilt to the left<br/>
The shirt blend with the sweats<br/>
Your girls skirts invest<br/>
She undressin', don't stare<br/>
Check the picture nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm the one<br/>
Young H-O, a game of one<br/>
What you think I'd do to the brain of that dame you brung<br/>
Listen hon, twist one, this Armi, sip some<br/>
It's only 40 proof, it feel like 151<br/>
When I'm done<br/>
Make a run with The Roc<br/>
Rock Air Force 1's<br/>
Rock a bun, hide shit in her hair when I come<br/>
Through customs, cops can't bust him<br/>
It's Hov the Hustler, I'm having one hell of a run<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
And you like it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Chris]</i><br/>
All those haters talkin' shit we don't like it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
No, we love it<br/>
I got a mommy with a body, don't touch it<br/>
You can't fuck wit<br/>
Young Easy, I on the Just Blaze production<br/>
You get nothin'<br/>
We get enough spins<br/>
Can't stop us from coppin bottles while we clubbin'<br/>
It's the R-O-C forever, tell the public, huh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rell]</i><br/>
Those seen here we'll lead you forever<br/>
And we will not leave you, never<br/>
And our voices will ring (<i>[Sparks:]</i> "rrriinngg") together<br/>
As one<br/>
