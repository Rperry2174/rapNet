Uh, yeah<br/>
You mess around with known assassins, known for blastin' Known for carrying plastic pistols, chrome-attached<br/>
And known for grossing the most<br/>
Known for ballin' the hardest, holdin' our own in our post<br/>
Known for soakin' ya folks, sendin' hoes to ya coast<br/>
I'm down for whatever<br/>
<br/>
Jigga man, ya heard<br/>
Jay Z, ya heard<br/>
Hova, ya heard<br/>
Roc-A-Fella, ya heard<br/>
Sigel-Sigel, ya heard<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody wanna rhyme like Hov<br/>
Cause I rhyme like I be rhymin' in the Rov'<br/>
Climbin' in them hoes<br/>
My minds like the diamonds, I'll blind you at them shows<br/>
I don't shine, I glow<br/>
I remind you of that dough<br/>
Don't I? Kill niggas won't I?<br/>
My per-sona, hustler turned rapper, smell a crack aroma<br/>
Send shots like toma! in any language<br/>
Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth<br/>
Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs<br/>
And get the camcorder to camcord their hand movements<br/>
And for what? ya'll actin' like ya'll better than Hov<br/>
Ya'll cats should open up on the Letterman show<br/>
Cats is funny<br/>
All I do is get money and ya'll shit sound funny to me<br/>
Everybody's talkin' like they better than Hov<br/>
But that shit's real funny to me<br/>
<br/>
Jigga man, ya heard<br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo<br/>
D.A. act like he had a starvin' for Jay<br/>
If they lock me in a cage, yo party away<br/>
I'm still hot, I'm still S.Dot ya'll<br/>
Still got millions buried in the sock drawer<br/>
Still holdin' my own on the corner nigga<br/>
What can't kill me can only make me stronger, nigga<br/>
And when I get back home<br/>
Get your ass up out the throne<br/>
Everything's back to the way shit was<br/>
I'm a stay hot no matter what my shit does<br/>
I could drop a straight dud, I'm a stay up<br/>
Niggas tryin' to break my will<br/>
You know that ain't my steel<br/>
I'm Destiny's Child, my fate's been sealed<br/>
You're dealin' with a higher power<br/>
Do 'em like Dwight Eisenhower<br/>
My life can move a thousand miles an hour<br/>
Reflect me folks<br/>
As my world turns like the wheels on a bicycle spoke<br/>
It's much deeper than a soap, it's a constant drama series<br/>
All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury<br/>
All this bullshit can make the mind weary<br/>
But my theory is the sun shines clearly<br/>
The sun shall shine clearly<br/>
<br/>
You know what I do?<br/>
Flow sicker on every record, watch shine<br/>
Glock nine nigga, heavy necklace<br/>
Watch mine, about to make niggas very jealous<br/>
Ice in every letter<br/>
Untouchable, can't fuck the dude<br/>
Duck spit, arm shake who Juan Don play<br/>
With this CEO of the coke on Broadway<br/>
Never heard so many joints from one man<br/>
I make chickens bounce, I make the gun jam<br/>
Flow's like sniffin' a hundred grams<br/>
Of cocaine raw, rip ya whole brain off<br/>
Make it real easy to rip ya chain off<br/>
BK style, see Jay howl<br/>
We don't play fair, we play foul<br/>
Go ahead stand there we spray crowds<br/>
<br/>
Jigga, huh<br/>
Jigga, what<br/>
Jigga, what<br/>
Jigga-Jigga, huh<br/>
Jigga, what<br/>
Jigga, what<br/>
Jigga-Jigga, huh<br/>
Jigga, huh<br/>
Jigga, what<br/>
Jigga-Jigga, huh<br/>
Jigga, what<br/>
<br/>
I'm a monster, I sleep whole winters; wake up and spit summers<br/>
Ghetto nigga, puttin' up Will Smith numbers<br/>
Got money for 6's and Hummers, chickens among us<br/>
We just tryin' not to let this bullshit become us<br/>
<br/>
Flow like none other, I'm the meanest, toughest, done dotta to gun-butcher
