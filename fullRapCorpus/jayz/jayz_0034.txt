<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Turn the lights all the way<br/>
Turn the lights all the way down<br/>
What Uhhuh Yeah <br/>
(Uhh)<br/>
Come on<br/>
Big flow<br/>
(GGRRRRRR)<br/>
Come on yeah come on <br/>
<br/>
Yo Yo J-A-Y, I flow sick<br/>
Fuck all y'all haters blow dick<br/>
I spits the game for those that throw bricks<br/>
Money cash hoes money cash chicks what<br/>
Sex murder and mayhem romance for the street<br/>
Only wife of mines is a life of crime<br/>
And since, life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests<br/>
How can I not flirt with death <br/>
That's life's a nigga, long as life prevent us<br/>
We gonna send a lot and pray to Christ forgive us<br/>
Fuck it<br/>
Ice the wrists and raise the price on these niggaz<br/>
Y'all cant floss on my level<br/>
I'll invite you all to get wit us if ya ball is glitter<br/>
When I go all the harlem playaz wall my picture<br/>
If you get close enough you can read the scripture<br/>
It reads money cash hoes how real was that nigga what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Money cash hoes money cash hoes (WHAT)<br/>
Money cash hoes money cash hoes (UHH)<br/>
Money cash hoes money cash hoes (COME ON)<br/>
Money cash hoes (WHAT) hoes (WHAT) hoes (WHAT)<br/>
<br/>
Flavors robust platinum and gold touch <br/>
Y'all rap now, fast money lets slow it up<br/>
Niggaz try to stop Jay-Z to no luck<br/>
Roc-A-Fella foreva CEO what what<br/>
Us the villains, fuck your feelings<br/>
While yall playa hate we in the upper millions<br/>
Whats the dealings (huh) its like New York's been soft<br/>
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings<br/>
I'm tryin to restore the feelings fuck the law keep dealing<br/>
More money more cash more chilling<br/>
I know they gone criticize the hook on this song<br/>
Like I give a fuck I'm just a crook on this song<br/>
Bed-Stuy Brooknon took on the world <br/>
Shit I led a life you can write a book on<br/>
Sex murder and mayhem romance for the street <br/>
Man and I tell ya itll be the best seller<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[DMX:]</i><br/>
D-M-X and my dogs bite<br/>
Jigga my nigga rhyme all night<br/>
Thugs for life one night with this rap shit<br/>
Let em go and I bet they know what'll happen <br/>
When we clap shit<br/>
Actin like we owe em something<br/>
Then we show em something<br/>
Talk greasy I think they found em down the road or something<br/>
Fuckin wit a madman in a bad mood<br/>
Its like fuckin wit a mad dog that wasnt fed food<br/>
And the only thing thats stoppin him is you <br/>
Cause the only thing that he'll be droppin is you<br/>
Topic include; choppin in two<br/>
Drop it to Clue and the response from the street<br/>
This was one dog that loves raw meat<br/>
But gettin back to just cause I, love my niggaz <br/>
I shed blood, for my niggaz <br/>
Let a nigga holler where my niggaz<br/>
All I'ma hear is right here my nigga <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
