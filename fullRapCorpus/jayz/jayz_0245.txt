<i>[Jay-Z talking]</i><br/>
Uh huh<br/>
(scratching) "chi chi chi chilly chill"<br/>
This gangsta gangsta uh<br/>
Uh huh<br/>
This gangsta gangsta shit<br/>
"chi chi chilly chill"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm from murder murder Marcyville<br/>
My nigga you heard we clap you we certainly will<br/>
South Philly mothrfuckers kill at will<br/>
Bet the mack milly make you niggas "chilly chill"<br/>
Murder murder Marcyville<br/>
My nigga you heard we clap you we certainly will<br/>
South Philly motherfuckers kill at will<br/>
Bet the mack milly make you niggas "chilly chill"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Check the four corners of the earth I'm a man of respect<br/>
Marcy projects motherfucker I'm demanding respect<br/>
The niggas done fucked up and they called in the cleaners<br/>
Jayo you're not a felon you're a misdemeanor<br/>
Don't let the Nina hit you and split your beam up<br/>
Fuck the punks with you we hit your team up (buck buck)<br/>
Y'all niggas hurtin'<br/>
That publicity stunt is not workin'<br/>
You made a bad situation worsen<br/>
Y'all wanna see me out this game like Rider<br/>
You fuckers better stop that ?we came from a game wider<br/>
How the fuck you gone try us?<br/>
You can't deny us<br/>
Of a dollar it's the Roc bitch holla!<br/>
Beef ain't nothing to a boss nigga<br/>
You crossed the line<br/>
The orders go out to kick in your doors<br/>
Wavin' the 4 4<br/>
All I heard was Jigga I don't want it no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i><br/>
Yo you heard a nigga fronted on Bleek word?<br/>
Nigga, never fronted on Bleek word<br/>
If it's written I wrote it<br/>
You spit it I spoke it<br/>
So...Never forget Bleek totin'<br/>
I'm from murder murder Marcyville<br/>
If y'all look in the mirror do y'all see real?<br/>
We see through your visad<br/>
Y'all soft like Q-tip cotton<br/>
Y'all dudes ain't hardly real<br/>
The boss spit off M-po's certainly will<br/>
If I smack this kid you'll probably squeal<br/>
So open the hydro we firing still<br/>
We clear out the building like a fire drill and<br/>
Money too long for y'all to fold<br/>
You know to catch a case to me is like a common cold<br/>
So get your guns out you ain't ready for war<br/>
You know the R-O-C too strong for y'all<br/>
Motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Geda K]</i><br/>
Yo, I'm in a zone<br/>
You niggas done disturbed the peace<br/>
I try to relax<br/>
Still got word off the street<br/>
Hear you frail bastards tryin' to get your name back<br/>
You ain't achieve shit since you got your name in rap<br/>
We can't be misjudged you hear the flows and the lyrics and<br/>
The fifth slugs'll tear holes in your spirit and<br/>
It's like rap turned y'all to kill and hustle<br/>
Knowin' y'all gone snitch if I hop one touch you<br/>
Talk that gangsta slang be a gangsta slain<br/>
These N-Y-M-P gangstas bang<br/>
How you talk real but need your click to live?<br/>
All I need is the fifth and two clips to give<br/>
Geda keep the unsane ratchet<br/>
For y'all who swear y'all can dodge the rain put on your rain jackets<br/>
It's the game y'all ain't fit for drams with us<br/>
And we pop the big guns that tear through armored trucks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i>
