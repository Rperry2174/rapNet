<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
This is black hoodie rap, there's no fear in my eyes where they lookin at<br/>
Better look on map, Besides, mi nah like to eye fight<br/>
Mi nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (CHRIST!!!)<br/>
But if a man test my Stuy, I promise he won't like my reply<br/>
Boom Bye Bye like Buju I'm crucial<br/>
I'm a Brooklyn boy I may take some gettin use to<br/>
Chain snatchin, ain't have it, gotta get it<br/>
Same shitted, from Brownsville to Bainbrididge<br/>
Fatherless child, mama put double shifts<br/>
So the number runners was the only one I hanged widith<br/>
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fidith<br/>
Fit no orangutans piddeals ciddaps like orange's I'm dangerous<br/>

<i>[Verse Two: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I father, I Brooklyn Dodger them<br/>
I Jack, I Rob, I sin<br/>
Awww man, I'm Jackie Robinson<br/>
Except when I run base, I dodge the pen<br/>
Lucky me, lucky we, they didn't get me<br/>
Now when I bring the Nets I'm the Black Branch Ricky<br/>
From Brooklyn corners, burnin branches of sticky<br/>
Spread love, Biggie, Brooklyn, hippie<br/>
I pity, the fool with jewels like Mr. T<br/>
With long history in my borough, they borrow<br/>
With no intentions of returnin, tomorrow<br/>
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie<br/>
Half orphan, mama never had an abortion<br/>
Papa sort of did, still I managed to live<br/>
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib<br/>
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Santogold (Jay-Z &amp; Santogold)]</i><br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Santogold]</i><br/>
While I'm doin my time due to circumstance<br/>
Cross that bridge is the consequence<br/>
Once pretend now I paid my dues<br/>
Risk takers we break the rules<br/>
Get so dark, but I see good<br/>
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods<br/>
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin<br/>
(BROOK-LYN!!!) Let it be sworn in<br/>
Gotta make it stick workin like we good color<br/>
Rip it to the core, underneath it or we oughta<br/>
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor<br/>
One step one step give it up more<br/>
All this stuff and the streets are a mess<br/>
With big ass dreams and a sick death wish<br/>
Probably like the commercials says<br/>
Kill the voice screamin in my head<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Santogold]</i><br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Santogold]</i><br/>
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
