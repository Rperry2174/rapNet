<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, uh uh uh<br/>
It's big pimpin baby..<br/>
It's big pimpin, spendin G's<br/>
Feel me.. uh-huh uhh, uh-huh..<br/>
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah<br/>
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah..<br/>
<br/>
You know I - thug em, fuck em, love em, leave em<br/>
Cause I don't fuckin need em<br/>
Take em out the hood, keep em lookin good<br/>
But I don't fuckin feed em<br/>
First time they fuss I'm breezin<br/>
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?"<br/>
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch<br/>
Better trust than believe em<br/>
In the cut where I keep em<br/>
til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts<br/>
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up<br/>
Let em play with the dick in the truck<br/>
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs<br/>
Divorce him and split his bucks<br/>
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread<br/>
so you can be livin it up?  Shit I..<br/>
parts with nothin, y'all be frontin<br/>
Me give my heart to a woman?<br/>
Not for nothin, never happen<br/>
I'll be forever mackin<br/>
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion<br/>
I got no patience<br/>
And I hate waitin..<br/>
Hoe get yo' ass in<br/>
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now<br/>
RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah<br/>
And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now<br/>
RI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We doin.. big pimpin, we spendin G's<br/>
Check em out now<br/>
Big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s<br/>
We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.<br/>
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B<br/>
Yo yo yo.. big pimpin, spendin G's<br/>
We doin - big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s<br/>
We doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.<br/>
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B]</i><br/>
Nigga it's the - big Southern rap impresario<br/>
Comin straight up out the black bar-rio<br/>
Makes a mill' up off a sorry hoe<br/>
Then sit back and peep my sce-nawr-e-oh<br/>
Oops, my bad, that's my scenario<br/>
No I can't fuck a scary hoe<br/>
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go<br/>
Hoes start pointin - they say, "There he go!"<br/>
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit<br/>
We don't pull it out over little shit<br/>
And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit<br/>
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab<br/>
Don't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me<br/>
and you see us comin down on yo' slab<br/>
Livin ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it<br/>
But nigga if you hatin I<br/>
then you wait while I get yo' bitch butt-naked, just break it<br/>
You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on<br/>
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin to the track <br/>
Timbaland let me spit my pro's on<br/>
Pump it up in the pro-zone<br/>
That's the track that we breakin these hoes on<br/>
Ain't the track that we flow's on<br/>
But when shit get hot, then the glock start poppin like ozone<br/>
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man<br/>
Fo' real it don't get no bigger man<br/>
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin throwed on the flip<br/>
Gettin blowed with the motherfuckin Jigga Man, fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two: Bun B]</i><br/>
We be.. big pimpin, spendin G's<br/>
We be.. big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s<br/>
We be.. big pimpin down in P.A.T.<br/>
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B<br/>
Cause we be.. big pimpin, spendin G's<br/>
And we be.. big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s<br/>
Cause we be.. big pimpin in P.A.T.<br/>
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B.. nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C]</i><br/>
Uhh.. smokin out, throwin up, keepin lean up in my cup<br/>
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck<br/>
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall<br/>
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all<br/>
If I wasn't rappin baby, I would still be ridin Mercedes<br/>
Chromin shinin sippin daily, no rest until whitey pay me<br/>
Uhhh, now what y'all know bout them Texas boys<br/>
Comin down in candied toys, smokin weed and talkin noise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two]</i>
