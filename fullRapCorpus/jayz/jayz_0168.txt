You ain't got enough stamps in your passport to fuck with young H-O<br/>
International ... uugh ...<br/>
show ya young boys how to do this thing<br/>
<br/>
the maturation of Jay-Z Z<br/>
check me out<br/>
<br/>
30's the new 20 nigga I'm so hot still<br/>
better broad better au-to-mo-bile<br/>
bet a yard, nah bet a hundred mill<br/>
then by the songs end I probably start another trend<br/>
I know everything you wan do<br/>
I did all that by the age of 21<br/>
by 22 I had that brand new Ack Coupe<br/>
I guess you can say that my legend just begun<br/>
I'm, young enough to know the right car to buy yet grown enough not to put rims on it<br/>
I got that six-duce with curtains so you can't see me and I didn't even have to put tints on it<br/>
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch<br/>
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the night spot<br/>
I got the right stock<br/>
I ... got ... stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops<br/>
I know you like fuck, this is child abuse<br/>
call D.Y.F.S.*, I might just be gettin' nicer<br/>
them young boys ain't ready for real<br/>
30's the new 20 niggia I'm so hot still<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I use to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck<br/>
bae boy, now I'm all grown up<br/>
I use to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck<br/>
bae boy, now I'm all grown up<br/>
I use to play the block like that (like that)<br/>
I use to carry knots like that (like that)<br/>
now I got black cards, good credit and such<br/>
bae boy, cause I'm all grown up<br/>
<br/>
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm on fire still<br/>
these young boys is like a fire drills (uugh)<br/>
false alarms (uugh)<br/>
next don? (naah)<br/>
heen got- (on)<br/>
to the next one (Young)<br/>
I'm still here (yeah)<br/>
still here, like Mike gotta stop playin' with these children (yeah)<br/>
I'm a bully with the bucks<br/>
don't let the patten leather shoes fool you young'n, I got the fully in the tux<br/>
that was my past now I'm so grown up<br/>
I don't got one gun on me, got a slum army<br/>
to hire a gun army, get you spun like laundry<br/>
and I'll be somewhere under palm trees calmly<br/>
listen to R&amp;B when we get the call he's<br/>
no longer wit' us fire your babysitters<br/>
you lil' fucks fall back for real<br/>
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I use to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck<br/>
bae boy, now I'm all grown up<br/>
I use to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck<br/>
bae boy, now I'm all grown up<br/>
I use to wear my hoodie like that (like that)<br/>
pile deep in the hoopty like that (like that)<br/>
now I got black cards, good credit and such<br/>
bae boy, cause I'm all grown up<br/>
<br/>
Yall roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day<br/>
yall young'ns chase, I'm Patron and it's straight<br/>
I like South Beach but I'm in San Tropez<br/>
yall drink Dom but not Rose' (hey)<br/>
your chick shop in the mall<br/>
my chick burnin' down Bergdorf's<br/>
comin' back with Birken Bags<br/>
your chick is like what type of purse is that?<br/>
I'm from the era where niggas don't snitch<br/>
you from the era where snitchin' is the shit<br/>
I'm afraid of the future (why?)<br/>
 yall respect the one who got shot<br/>
I respect the shooter<br/>
yall go to parties to ice grill<br/>
I go to parties to party with nice girls<br/>
you young boys gotta chill<br/>
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I use to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck<br/>
bae boy, now I'm all grown up<br/>
I use to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck<br/>
bae boy, now I'm all grown up<br/>
yeah we use to ball like that (like that)<br/>
Now we own the ball team, halla back (holla back)<br/>
now I got black cards, good credit and such<br/>
bae boy, cause I'm all grown up<br/>
