<i>[Jay-Z has a conversation with some cat]</i><br/>
Hah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah<br/>
What it is player?<br/>
You player, it's all about you<br/>
How you gon' say that man<br/>
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in<br/>
Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off<br/>
Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealin that hoe money<br/>
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sho' money<br/>
Check this out man, when you run up on your bitch<br/>
this this is what you tell her<br/>
Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot<br/>
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds, all cherry<br/>
like a hymen, when I'm rhymin with remarkable timin<br/>
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen<br/>
Spittin venom up in the, minds of young women<br/>
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar<br/>
Might you remember, my shit is col-l-l-ld like December<br/>
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere<br/>
chromosomes make a nigga Jigga Jay-Z lethal drugs<br/>
Eighteen carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets<br/>
Words worth a million like I'm rappin em through platinum teeth<br/>
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned<br/>
Cause all beef return well done filet mignon<br/>
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I<br/>
yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro<br/>
As if you didn't know, Jay's about gettin dough<br/>
Spittin flow like fine wines down your earlobe<br/>
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol<br/>
Honies hum in melody when I, rub it like crystal<br/>
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb<br/>
then the predicate, with this rich nigga preterite<br/>
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole<br/>
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know<br/>
From New York, to Paris, the vocal style vary<br/>
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, now<br/>
notice, the child swift like a locust<br/>
Focus on the loc' I be the greatest nigga that wrote it<br/>
Return of the Jedi, from Rio Degenero<br/>
Worn da red eye, yet I, still feel the need to be fly<br/>
I did die when I'm rappin then slide like satin<br/>
You know the black eye white china in the brain cabinet<br/>
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice<br/>
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice<br/>
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard<br/>
and the only time you love em is when your dick hard<br/>
<br/>
Whoooh! That's cashmere baby<br/>
Nah, you know, that's just laid back man<br/>
Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z<br/>
Yeah baby<br/>
Motherfuckin pimp that's what he be<br/>
Cashmere baby<br/>
Don't get no hotter than that<br/>
Sho' you're right<br/>
Them niggaz know<br/>
<br/>
Check it out, check it out<br/>
Ghettoes, Errol Flynn, hot like heroin<br/>
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your burough in<br/>
I gotta keep your tricks intact<br/>
Cause I walk like a p-iyimp, talk like a mack man<br/>
The star player, the golden bar layer<br/>
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sho' yo right<br/>
I'm game tight, so watch it it change to night<br/>
Go tell your peeps dawg I'm lethal til it ain't right<br/>
I pimp hard on a trick, look<br/>
Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good foot
