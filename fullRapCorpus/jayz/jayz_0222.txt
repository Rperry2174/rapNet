<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Nickels and dimes<br/>
Sticks to my mind<br/>
I'll never win<br/>
You have my friends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Got a thing for nickel plated nines and pretty dimes<br/>
Mac-11 I squeeze like lemon limes<br/>
Squirt obey your thirst, fashion lines<br/>
Between beauty and beast, I walk the line<br/>
Johnny Cash, I'm a real G<br/>
I cut my self today to see if I still bleed<br/>
Success is so sublime<br/>
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind<br/>
Something 'bout the struggle so divine<br/>
This sort of love is hard to define<br/>
When you scratching for every nickel and dime<br/>
Got me itching to do this shit for my mom<br/>
Do this shit for my town<br/>
Leave the door open hoping they kick it down<br/>
The purist form of giving is anonymous to anonymous<br/>
We gonna make it there, I promise this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel survivor's guilt<br/>
I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell<br/>
Now I'm part of the problem far as I could tell<br/>
Did I do it for him or do it for myself<br/>
Can't lie to myself<br/>
I love my niggas more than my own blood<br/>
I die for my niggas and I love my cub, hope that's not fucked up<br/>
I got a problem with the handouts, I took the man route<br/>
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now<br/>
No guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out<br/>
No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason<br/>
Can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth<br/>
That will drive me gaga<br/>
Run up in your momma's house, two nickels, one dime<br/>
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down<br/>
I'm just trying to find common ground<br/>
'fore Mr. Belafonte come and chop a nigga down<br/>
Mr. Day O, major fail<br/>
Respect these youngins boy, it's my time now<br/>
Hublot homie, two door homie<br/>
You don't know all the shit I do for the homies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Pardon my hubris, Stanley Kubrick<br/>
With eyes wide shut, I could cook up two bricks<br/>
Turn nickels to dime, turn dimes to quarters<br/>
Turn wives from daughters, oh, I'm clear as water<br/>
And just for clarity, my presence is charity<br/>
My flow is a gift, philanthropist<br/>
Everybody around me rich, or will be<br/>
Baby boy I promise you this, or kill me<br/>
And when a nigga go as the old adage go<br/>
You die rich or you die a disgrace, so just let me grow<br/>
Watch me cook, throw no looks<br/>
Like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked<br/>
Y'all not worthy, sometimes I feel like<br/>
Y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly<br/>
The greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous<br/>
So here y'all go, I promise this<br/>
<br/>
