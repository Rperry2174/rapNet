<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
No more reason I gotta prove to be da illest MC<br/>
Somthing's wrong wit ya motor skills cause y'all ain't movin me<br/>
I'm who you see musically when you want it done hot<br/>
Comparin' you to me is a lesson in futility stop<br/>
I paint pictures beautifully but niggaz is near sighted<br/>
Don't worry about plagerist it'll take em years to bite it<br/>
Which the greatest fears I don't write it<br/>
It just appears outta nowhere like the information contain by the physic<br/>
Like it or not I pay dues and expect to be paid back<br/>
Why da fuck should I freestyle I'm gettin paid to rap<br/>
I sling a track laid back almost till it's a sin<br/>
Tell ya god somebody's doin a good job impersonatin' him<br/>
J-Hova spittin game from da range rover<br/>
What tha fuck is y'all doin in da third lane get over<br/>
Slow ya rode up I got it sewed up like a tella<br/>
Relatively easy like jerry hella<br/>
Cream is cherry vanilla got chicks in da telli<br/>
Belly up soundin like mayhelia tryna tell y'all<br/>
Y'all know da style burn da town<br/>
Down and change the locale I'm doin da same shit except its legit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit<br/>
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit<br/>
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit<br/>
They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made dat shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gotti]</i><br/>
Pimp Gotti get da dues in them double down<br/>
Like them kids with tips who tops down<br/>
Bricks who get money quick see me<br/>
representin bomb city on da bill block rockin' mic's<br/>
Before they get a mill I sold pills all night<br/>
The illest outta life got my mind on fate<br/>
Cause even on tour nigga still ain't safe<br/>
I keep a tre eight on my left smoke a L for stress countin dirt bag lex<br/>
I be da X like malcom puff for now dunn east side represent wit tons of guns<br/>
You keep it real where you from<br/>
Cause where you at might put da dagger in yo back<br/>
Its like livin wit yo homey that be on crack<br/>
And fact my niggaz know my styles phat like hoes in da El Dorado<br/>
My mind toatin fuck em duck em<br/>
Any thing but da main gun I don't trust em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Boo]</i><br/>
Move wit da nigga huh from man chilla<br/>
Burge shit word shit I slpurge big scrilla<br/>
Observe when you work spit bird shit killah<br/>
Not to be purterb with...herb shit deala<br/>
Can make me feel y'all foreal ya tock ticking<br/>
Bust a rapper bust a cap hustler stop flinching<br/>
You fresh off the corner calling dog shit brog shit<br/>
Soon as you feel that sog shit you be like oh shit (stoooooop)<br/>
Broke niggaz resort the glass looking<br/>
Opposite the track ass whooping<br/>
Opposite the black class hooker the fat ass fooker<br/>
Triple your cash criple your stash pass shooker<br/>
The past ain't never the last to teach lessons<br/>
My peeps fucking up in the streets keep guessing<br/>
Brew don't becomming a preach I be blessing<br/>
Lotta kids commmin out da wrong way like sea sections<br/>
Know da bro gone flow even if it cross shorts<br/>
Fuck weed cop coke cause da shit cost more<br/>
But niggaz say I floss to much<br/>
but when I take it off and such they say I lost my touch<br/>
Those bitches like the money I wear<br/>
What its funny how they stare<br/>
Dumb bunnies with they cunnin' little glare<br/>
Shorty let me see the tail if its really that shittin<br/>
She hit me with a felion a young pair kitten<br/>
My boy hit that shit now every body smitten<br/>
Even holdin snow balls and I ain't talkin bout mittens<br/>
what I talkin bout mittens foreal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
