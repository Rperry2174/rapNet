<i>[Beyonce talking]</i><br/>
Delivery me from my enemies oh god<br/>
Defend me from those that rise up against me<br/>
Deliver me from the work of inequities <br/>
the savior from the blood of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z - Verse one]</i><br/>
look, mind state of a gangster from the 40's<br/>
meet the vicious mind of Motown's Berry Gordy<br/>
turn crack rocks into a chain of 40/40's<br/>
sorry my jewelery so gordy<br/>
slid into the party with my new pair of Maury's<br/>
America meet the gangsta Shawn Corey<br/>
hey young world wanna hear a story?<br/>
close your eyes and you could pretend your me<br/>
a cut from the cloth of the Kennedy's<br/>
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese<br/>
this is the genesis of a nemesis<br/>
mother America's not witnessing<br/>
the Harlem renaissance birthed black businesses<br/>
this is the tale of lost innocences as the incents burn<br/>
and the turn tables turn and that Al Greens plays<br/>
i see my mother's afro as momma taps her toes as she rolls her jays<br/>
and my poppa just left the house, in search of the killer of my Uncle Ray<br/>
and she's trying to calm my nerves, as i observe this is just one day<br/>
and what tomorrow has in store we could never be sure so all we can do is<br/>
Pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce Talking]</i><br/>
Because of your strength<br/>
while i walked upon the <br/>
for god is my defense<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
as i head towards my home room I observe the rooms though needles on the ground<br/>
I hear a car go vrooom drug dealer in the BM with the top down<br/>
as the girls start to giggle I ask why you laugh they say "you too little"<br/>
one day you'll understand when you become a man 'bout things you have to get you<br/>
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol<br/>
fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful<br/>
I didn't choose this life this life chose me<br/>
around here is the shit that you just do<br/>
I just left school, the same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue<br/>
they had they guns drawn screaming just move<br/>
unless there something else you suggest we can do<br/>
he made his way to the trunk, opened it like a huh<br/>
a treasure chest was removed<br/>
cops said he'll be back next month<br/>
what we call corrupt he called paying dues<br/>
now when the rules is blurred as they hears a  what am I to do<br/>
but pray, pray the lord forgive me<br/>
pray guys goodbye for what I'm about go through<br/>
Pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce Talking]</i><br/>
Delivery me in thy righteousness <br/>
it cause me to escape and climb thy air until i am<br/>
Save me lord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
anyway there's oppression the drug profession<br/>
flourishes like beverages refreshing<br/>
sweet taste of sin everything I've seen made me everything I am<br/>
bad drug dealer or I victim I beg<br/>
what came first moving chickens or the egg <br/>
this is why I be so fresh I'm trying to beat life<br/>
because I can't cheat death<br/>
the truth is the shamelessness ain't stainless is that aim this is <br/>
you know who's game this is<br/>
move coke like Pepsi it don't matter what the brand name is<br/>
I stand behind mine everything I do I'm a man behind mine<br/>
I'm not a angel I'm sure but every night before I lay<br/>
I drop my knees to the floor and I pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce Talking]</i><br/>
The name shall endure forever<br/>
The name shall continue as long as the sun will<br/>
Men shall be blessed in him<br/>
All nations shall call him blessed<br/>
In your name I pray<br/>
For you blessings
