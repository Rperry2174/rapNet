Oh...<br/>
I like the party life...<br/>
Break Out The Red Lights<br/>
The city in bright lights<br/>
Welcome To The Party Life<br/>
These girls dressin' skintight...<br/>
Welcome to the 70's--Sweet!<br/>
<br/>
Ordered some Patreezy<br/>
While talkin' to this breezy<br/>
Brushin' off my three-piece, I make this look too easy<br/>
So tall and lanky, my suit?<br/>
It should thank me<br/>
I make it look good to be this hood,<br/>
Meyer Lansky mixed with lucky lefty<br/>
Gangster, effortlessly<br/>
Poppa was a rolling stone-its in my ancestry<br/>
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me<br/>
And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY<br/>
<br/>
(Baby I, I said I sport fly shit, I should win the Espy....<br/>
I'm really in another league, babe.......<br/>
I got a slick mouth, you might wanna roll with me,)<br/>
<br/>
I'm on her bra strap, she's on my dick<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, that's my bitch<br/>
I be the boss of that, I'm on her shit<br/>
So all you niggas fall back, I'll split ya wig<br/>
She's my little quarterback ....ya dig?<br/>
Cause I'm all that in the sack ....ya, ya dig?<br/>
I spoiled her<br/>
Foiled it if you fakin', Jack<br/>
She's used to million-dollar vacations<br/>
Fuck you all gonna do with that?<br/>
<br/>
When you're blue<br/>
You got nothin' to do<br/>
(Ay, baby, see,....<br/>
When you're used to Filet Mignon,)<br/>
Head into the party life<br/>
(Its kinda hard to go back to Hamburger Helper...)<br/>
If you're feelin' low<br/>
We got to go<br/>
(Its your choice though, baby....)<br/>
Get into the party life<br/>
<br/>
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?<br/>
(Yeah, baby....)<br/>
Is you headin' to the party life?<br/>
(Is you rollin'?<br/>
You can stall out or ball out....)<br/>
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?<br/>
Is you headin' to the party life?<br/>
(Make a choice....<br/>
Its so gangster, baby....)<br/>
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?<br/>
<br/>
Sippin' on my vino<br/>
Got me cooler than Pacino<br/>
When DeNiro put together my real life its like CASINO<br/>
They should pay me for some B-roll<br/>
Takin' G-strolls through the ghee-to<br/>
When rap-p-p-pid fire's just a necessary evil<br/>
Hola Hovito', cooler than zero<br/>
B-low fresh one blade, no chemo<br/>
Art with no easel<br/>
Please, its no equal<br/>
Ya boy's off the wall, these other niggas is Tito<br/>
<br/>
Oh...<br/>
I like the party life<br/>
The city in bright lights<br/>
These girls dressin' skintight...<br/>
(Damn,.....<br/>
Ay baby, I said I'm, I'm Off The Wall, I'm like a...<br/>
young Michael Jackson, these other niggas is Tito....<br/>
Shout out to Randy, Real Talk!)<br/>
<br/>
When you're blue<br/>
You got nothin' to do<br/>
(I'm gonna just let this ride out...)<br/>
Head into the party life<br/>
(I might let it ride out for like 7 minutes, you can groove to it, whatever)<br/>
If you're feelin' low<br/>
We got to go<br/>
(Lets two-step....aaow!)<br/>
Get into the party life<br/>
(Guru, turn the lights down, lets keep it smooth...<br/>
This that shit you roll up, like a little tight J to...<br/>
Sip ya little wine...)<br/>
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?<br/>
Is you headin' to the party life?<br/>
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'?<br/>
Is you headin' to the party life?<br/>
(whatever your vice is, you know?<br/>
Whatever YOU like to do...get into yo' comfort zone, baby....<br/>
Get into yo' comfort zone.....uh huh)<br/>
<br/>
When you're blue<br/>
You got nothin' to do<br/>
(Head into the party life.....)<br/>
Head into the party life<br/>
If you're feelin' low<br/>
We got to go<br/>
(I don't even want it to stop, tho, forreal tho...)<br/>
Get into the party life<br/>
<br/>
Step into my bedroom<br/>
I call it the Red room<br/>
C-cause it gets h-h-hot-t-t<br/>
I trust you gonna like it<br/>
See, why are we talkin' all this fly shit?<br/>
C-c-c-c-cause I'm the flyest<br/>
Hovito, baby<br/>
No equal, baby<br/>
So, petite n' gold<br/>
Let the beat go<br/>
Now I'm eatin' gold, baby<br/>
Hovito, baby<br/>
No equal, baby<br/>
So, petite n' gold<br/>
Let the beat go<br/>
Now can we go crazy?....<br/>
(Ooh!!!......)<br/>
<br/>
When you're blue<br/>
You got nothin' to do<br/>
Head into the party life<br/>
If you're feelin' low<br/>
We got to go<br/>
Get into the party life.....<br/>
<br/>
(Yo...nothin' in the world makes me sadder than to see a lonely girl....)
