<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball<br/>
Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss<br/>
It's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back<br/>
Get ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke<br/>
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc<br/>
It's Alright, you heard? It's Alright, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
I need a ho in my life to blow on my dice<br/>
So we can make our points twice and skate out a town<br/>
I need that glow in my ice, E-Class<br/>
Ladies screamin Jigga you know we ease that, flowin out like Jees-ass<br/>
Jay-Z and me holdin the mic<br/>
so when you like you find MC's so impolite<br/>
And me I'm so into nice, got cats on the corner like<br/>
Don't me and Jigga be flowin alike? <br/>
Nah, Not in your life ain't nobody copin like<br/>
Mr. Jay-Z, shit you're crazy<br/>
I'm hot like the six maybe, Deep dish with the great seats<br/>
I flow greater than you're navigator<br/>
I drop in you're town, block you're data<br/>
Pimps all comin through with a hot pair of gators<br/>
And a crew with rocks the size of craters<br/>
Can't touch like hot potatoes, Ya Heard?<br/>
<br/>
Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball<br/>
Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss<br/>
It's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back<br/>
Get ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke<br/>
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc<br/>
It's Alright, you heard? It's Alright, Holla back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek:]</i><br/>
In the middle of a war rockin a vest<br/>
Who's the illest shorty alive, I confess<br/>
I take nine to the chest and I swear to the heaven sky's, I bless<br/>
The mics until the day I rest, till they can feel what I feel<br/>
I'ma try my best, and if you real like I real<br/>
you can provide the rest<br/>
Anything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart<br/>
I'm playing my part, stretched out, just about the best out<br/>
Any nigga realer than me, is in a messhall with their chest out<br/>
Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me<br/>
We extort them as soon as they record 'em, Bleek<br/>
My name is clear, back when a shorty used to braid my hair<br/>
On the project stairs, Once I drop to a ceaser Ma I don't need ya<br/>
From the block to the hot two-seaters <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball<br/>
Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss<br/>
It's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back<br/>
Get ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke<br/>
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc<br/>
It's Alright, you heard? It's Alright, Check<br/>
<br/>
On the two Jew-el's I blew more money than Latrell, who else?<br/>
They don't know you, think they know you too well, you jell<br/>
Like Flubber I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set<br/>
Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate, Mr. I don't cop nothin<br/>
Less than eight, and anything involved with my name<br/>
Regardless of the fame<br/>
It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again,<br/>
Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express<br/>
My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress<br/>
To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya<br/>
I suggest let you live right? Negative, I swear<br/>
It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife<br/>
Close you're casket tight<br/>
Take you're last two deep breaths and pass the mic <br/>
To Jay-Z nigga, That's Right!!<br/>
<br/>
Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball<br/>
Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss<br/>
It's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back<br/>
Get ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke<br/>
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc<br/>
It's Alright, you heard? It's Alright
