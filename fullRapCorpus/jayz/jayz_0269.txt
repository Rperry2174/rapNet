<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Product of determination<br/>
One who made it through like the sperm who made him<br/>
I represent strength like the black mom who didn't terminate him<br/>
But in turn gave him her all<br/>
Now discussing barbershop back rooms<br/>
Online chat rooms and on the bathroom on the wall<br/>
Recall<br/>
I came from the bottom but the talent God gave him got him by<br/>
Y'all can hate him but that only made him stronger than<br/>
Hov end his sentence<br/>
Know you wanna roll when the Rolls comes 20 inches nigga<br/>
Standard I speak Spanish to these hoes and they know<br/>
Dame peso, my peso is large than The Lakers Payroll<br/>
But I'm the proud new owner of the Nets no diploma<br/>
No regrets don't even talk about no Ruckers motherfuckers<br/>
I am set like a tennis match<br/>
See where your interest at<br/>
Y'all don't get the big picture yet, nigga get<br/>
Go get yourself a flat screen, not only on the rap scene<br/>
Last seen on ESPN rapping<br/>
Boy Hov got a hell of a pen<br/>
He don't put it to paper he just write in the wind<br/>
I know you hate him now you wasn't liking him then<br/>
His paper getting long like IBM<br/>
Ey bien<br/>
It's all good, I see them<br/>
Trying to make a little fame off the name again<br/>
Advantage Carter<br/>
Young fuck try to catch up<br/>
You know the score nigga, half of Philly love<br/>
Haha<br/>
<br/>
S Dot talking off, come walk with me<br/>
If not, sit back and watch me do me<br/>
Just side line ballers<br/>
I thought I told ya<br/>
It's the undisputed champ-ion<br/>
Looking at them S. Dots it's about that time<br/>
The number one sellers since they first designed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Man, if things keep going like this tennis will never be the same after June 18th!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm ready<br/>
Looking at them S. Dots it's about that time<br/>
To do Michael Jordan numbers, the sneaker game is mine<br/>
I didn't make em for the ball court I made em to shine<br/>
So you can score big when you courting a dime<br/>
When niggas see me, shit they see the grind<br/>
You gotta be blind, you only see the shine<br/>
I dropped them S. Dots and in record time<br/>
The number one seller since they first design<br/>
50/50 you know how I handle mine<br/>
A nickle for you, give me my dime<br/>
Tell Paul Fireman, I got em on fire man<br/>
He ain't been this hot since A.I. was signed<br/>
Now a nigga talking to Kenyon Martin<br/>
Shawn Marion, shit I might be starting<br/>
S Dot NBA niggas<br/>
Went from being in VA to signing NBA niggas<br/>
I hurdled every hurdle<br/>
Every nigga that was out of a nigga's reach with my figure of speech<br/>
Open the door, with my niggas with me<br/>
Open it more for niggas I don't know
