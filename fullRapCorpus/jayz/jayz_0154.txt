<i>[R Kelly]</i><br/>
Dear God, bring our P-O-Ws home<br/>

AMEN!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
JEAH !!! Back blocked on everybody laptop<br/>
(HOV) Hittin' niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin'<br/>
(KELL) Oh yeah da niggas is comin' get out ya good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving<br/>
(HOV) And non other than da "R" and without further a due like Freddy get ready it's .....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R Kelly]</i><br/>
Whatever happen Lord, dont pass me by<br/>
Cause whenever I did wrong it was ya name I cried<br/>
I heard you forgave over and over again<br/>
But when I found out I love you, you became ammune to my sins<br/>
Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep (I see dead people)<br/>
And sometimes it's me Lord <br/>
I never wanted to be a thug father<br/>
I only wanted to be a son of a father<br/>
That's how it sounds inside, worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I<br/>
I gave up da weed and somehow Im still high<br/>
Three years still seein' them three guys Lord (Whoo)<br/>
Sometimes I dont know what you want from me, but I do know you know what I want from you<br/>
(Give it to me)<br/>
(Come on) Take away this Hennessey, take away me runnin' da streets<br/>
Stop people from rapin' me, take away all this jealously and prejudicy<br/>
Lord you said it was better place, I grew up around pimps, hustlers, hoes and project gates<br/>
Its HARD TO BELIEVE in what I cant see<br/>
I got to get this money and feed my family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Whatever in me guides my life, dear Lord Dont Let Me Die tonight <br/>
But if I shall before I wake, what shall I say <br/>
Its been a good run from hoodlum to outin' da states<br/>
How could one who made so much foul mistakes, still be allowed to have a smile on my face<br/>
How whatever da case Im glad it wasnt murder, in a town you never heard of<br/>
From a nickel plated burner<br/>
Now my life straight like a perm, tried to take da spot I earn<br/>
Muthafucka better learn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Its HOV) Back blocked on everybody laptop<br/>
(KELL) Hit niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin'<br/>
(HOV) Oh yeah da niggas is comin get out ya good dishes or somethin' like its Thanksgiving<br/>
(KELL) And non other than da "R" and without further a due like Freddy get ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R Kelly]</i><br/>
Lord hear me out, got a few more things to say<br/>
These demons be chasin' me like everyday (Come here)<br/>
Nah my life on crutches, never say I never walk again<br/>
But da devil is a lie cause I believe within'<br/>
You're da reason that Im still here, even though I dont act like it <br/>
Even though I hear my callin' and fight it <br/>
Fools do me so wrong, its hard to stay righteous<br/>
Pimpin was allowed to happen I'll hide it <br/>
Believe me Lord I want you, got money and fame but still it just wont do <br/>
Sometimes I dont like who I am, when I look in da mirror my reflection is Uncle Sam (Uncle Sam)<br/>
And every night I have these weird dreams, that a preacher trapped inside of me wake up and cant<br/>
breathe<br/>
I feel like its twenty of me, goin' twenty different directions on a one way street Lord<br/>
I got houses, money and cars, and met every single superstar<br/>
I got da whole music industry sold, but it still dont matter .......<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R Kelly &amp; Jay-Z]</i><br/>
When Im gone and my casket closed!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Whatever in me guides my life, dear Lord Dont Let Me Die tonight<br/>
But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate<br/>
I did what I did my heart was in da right place (Ohhh)<br/>
I guess so I can live it put food on my plate<br/>
You must still love me not to let it in by three that day<br/>
Well whatever da case Im glad it wasnt murder, in a town you never heard of<br/>
From a nickel plated burner<br/>
I guess Im not finished wit my journey, please forgive me for my sins <br/>
Shit Im still tryna learn me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(HOV) From da back block on everybody laptop<br/>
(KELL) Hit niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British was comin'<br/>
(HOV) Oh yeah da niggas is comin get out ya good dishes or somethin' like its Thanksgiving<br/>
(KELL) And non other than da "R" and without further a due like Freddy get ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<i>[(R Kelly) Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Many men (Whoo) have come and gone in these streets (Feel Me)<br/>
Walked alone in these streets (Ohhh) waitin' to hear from you (Come on Lord)<br/>
Oh Lord,(Whoo)wrap your arms (Wrap your arms around us God)around da hood<br/>
(Lift every peace from war, bring our soldiers home, Let us pray)
