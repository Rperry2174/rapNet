<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Catch up, niggas<br/>
<br/>
Damn you fadin' hov, how you gave 'em that?<br/>
Audemars-Piguet, with the alligator strap<br/>
Sick of y'all niggaz with ya now or later raps<br/>
Rap about it now, hope you get it later<br/>
Do a couple shows, hope you niggas is savin' up<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON<br/>
This particular watch be a one of one<br/>
That means none before it, none to come<br/>
The homie that's rappin' be the only one that has it<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON<br/>
You ain't heard? I push the sixes when the fives is out<br/>
You can't fight me, in the porsche I'll box you out<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON<br/>
We don't drive X5's we give 'em to baby-mammas<br/>
Push the big top that shake like the Kansas Chicken Snackboxx<br/>
I get it crackin' when I'm backing out the garage<br/>
A 360 drop farage, shutdown manhattan<br/>
Bucket low, like fuck it, though<br/>
Nights on, daytime, lights on, hell yeah I'm frontin' but you love it, though<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON<br/>
Nigga I'm a check writer your royalty recievers<br/>
Y'all eaten off Per Diem, on the low like a cesar<br/>
Pay ya taxes, you niggaz is husttlin' backwards<br/>
I cop and crash whips, Jay is a bastard<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON<br/>
How you want it, my jeans is 300<br/>
This ain't Diesel, nigga, these is Evisu<br/>
Top is rock, you know the rest<br/>
A big bucket of frozen water on my chest<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON<br/>
Get a crate, some crack, and some house slippers<br/>
A newspaper, look out boy, and get ya chips up<br/>
Or get a gun, a mask an escape route<br/>
Some ducktape'll make 'em take you to the house<br/>
And ma don't give him nothin', unless he treatin' you special<br/>
Soon he'll get desperate, and go down and bless you<br/>
And when he come up for air, with a mouth full of hair<br/>
Just grab your coach bag and get the fuck outta there, yeah<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS HON<br/>
Look, think big, fuck getting your nails done<br/>
Think cars, cribs, jewels, some shit for your son<br/>
Don't let 'em give you, hard dick and bubble gum<br/>
Make him cop the Lex bubble, 2001 hon<br/>
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS HON<br/>
And if your man got you bagging up, it could be worse<br/>
Just put a little in the baggy, put a little in the purse
