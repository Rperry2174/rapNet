It's that Rocafella music....<br/>
Soulful...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Say hello<br/>
To the bad guy<br/>
Hello<br/>
They say I'm a bad guy<br/>
I come from the bottom<br/>
But now I'm mad fly<br/>
Say Hello<br/>
They say I'm a menace<br/>
That's the picture they paint<br/>
Hello<br/>
They say a lot about me<br/>
Let me yell ya what I ain't<br/>
Hello<br/>
They say I'm a bad guy<br/>
Say Hi to the bad guy<br/>
Hello<br/>
I come from the bottom<br/>
But now I'm mad fly<br/>
They say I'm a menace<br/>
That's the picture they paint<br/>
They say a lot about me<br/>
Let me tell ya what I ain't<br/>
Say hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
They say a lot about me<br/>
Let me tell you what I ain't<br/>
<br/>
I ain't playing,<br/>
Life's short, so I aimed<br/>
I ain't waiting for life to start portrayin' em<br/>
Its twice as hard to get a job that's paying<br/>
So I ain't payin' attention to what you saying<br/>
Rain-drops keep falling on my brain<br/>
Constant in the drop, all flames<br/>
I'm so hot even if the weather change<br/>
I don't have no top, I'm insane<br/>
Remember darkskinned Jermaine?<br/>
Suede in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same<br/>
Except I'm no lame and you gonna know my name<br/>
Before I go to work and feel my pain<br/>
Saying, I'm a bad guy, why's that?<br/>
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga, I react<br/>
Secretly though, I know you admire that<br/>
You wish you had the balls to fire back--<br/>
Say hello, uh, uh, hello, uh. uh<br/>
You wish you had the balls to fire back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I ain't no ordinary nigga<br/>
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets you<br/>
Extraordinary figures<br/>
I'm an extra-ordinary nigga<br/>
Before my name became Jigga<br/>
Before I sang, I had that thang on sippers<br/>
Can't complain bout what they ain't gonna give ya<br/>
That ain't gonna get you shit, might as well give up<br/>
Or get up, get out and get something, nigga<br/>
Get a job, my nigga, or get to dumping<br/>
Only God can judge him, only he without sin<br/>
Can tell me if my means can justify my ends<br/>
Til' then, I'm just gonna fly in the Benz<br/>
Wire my friends through Western Union<br/>
Shh....surprising my sister, knockin'<br/>
Here comes the bad guy again!<br/>
Say hello<br/>
Uh uh<br/>
Hello<br/>
uh uh<br/>
Hello<br/>
Here comes the bad guy again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
We ain't thugs for the sake of just being thugs<br/>
Nobody do that where we grew at, nigga, DUH!<br/>
The poverty line, we not above<br/>
So out come the mask and glove cause we ain't feelin' the love<br/>
We ain't doing crime for the sake of doing crime<br/>
We movin' dimes cause we ain't doin' fine<br/>
One out of three of us is locked up doing time<br/>
You know what that type of shit can do to a nigga mind?<br/>
My mind on my money, money on my mind<br/>
If you owe me ten dollars, you ain't giving me nine<br/>
You all ain't give me 40 acres and a mule<br/>
So I got my Glock 40, now I'm cool<br/>
And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me<br/>
Somebody get him the word and tell him I don't approve<br/>
Tell him I'll remove the curses<br/>
If you tell me our schools gonna be perfect<br/>
When Jena 6 don't exist<br/>
Tell him that's when I'll stop saying bitch---BITCH!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
