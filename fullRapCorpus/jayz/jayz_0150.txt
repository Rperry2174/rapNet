<i>[Intro: Tone (R. Kelly)]</i><br/>
Yo, Duro, tell Rob to hurry up back in the booth, man<br/>
We got the Track joint<br/>

I gotta we set out to bring you the best possible heat<br/>
For your two step, me, Jigga and Kells<br/>
You know, so y'all just enjoy, aight<br/>
Yo, Rob you there? (Yeah) Your mic sound nice (uh-huh uh-huh)<br/>
You first to blow (yeah) Ight, you ready to blow (uh-huh)<br/>
Aight, let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, stop<br/>
Jigga, I'm about to put the shit down<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, stop<br/>
I'm about to, make these niggaz get down<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, stop<br/>
Guaranteed, these niggaz gonna feel us<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, stop<br/>
Tone and Poke, blow the motherfuckin' speakers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Grab a bottle, get two models<br/>
Thugs at Apollo's, niggaz wanna follow<br/>
I'm about to show you, how wild it gets<br/>
That nigga Hov', is the craziest<br/>
Stop at the club, bout a quarter to six<br/>
With a bottle in my hand, yellin' "Bitch, I'm rich"<br/>
Hey, y'all niggaz see me, I can't believe it<br/>
You startin' to sound like, you don't want it<br/>
Tony's on the drop, blue and yellow rocks<br/>
He keep yellin', stop, Sisqo's album flopped<br/>
What you wanna do, if you drinkin', I'm hangin' out with you<br/>
Five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Hang on y'all, let's have some fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It's Young... uh, mack alone, I'm back in the zone<br/>
I'm out they way, still these rappers won't leave me alone<br/>
I can give a fuck what these rappers sayin' bout me<br/>
That just let's me know, they can't go a day without me<br/>
Scared of me succeading, that's the reason you doubt me<br/>
Cuz if you ain't believe me, you wouldn't be thinkin' bout me<br/>
Sorta how like you, never crossed my mind<br/>
Until you crossed the line, stop...<br/>
Then I gotta come accross a rhyme<br/>
To let the world know you come across a mime<br/>
I do so much sauce with lines, with someone who saws my climb<br/>
From Marcy to party, where you soakin' up blue nine<br/>
Prude, am I, got a du-lema, I'm a dude from the hood<br/>
Who loves jewels, who am I?<br/>
You where placed in the same shoes, size 10/5<br/>
With a sick view, of the place you grew, dude, can I<br/>
Live, what I did, for this whole rap circus<br/>
I open up more doors for y'all fuckers than car service<br/>
Ya'll nervous, I ain't back yet<br/>
I'm on extended vaca', I ain't unpack yet, stop worrying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Hang on y'all, let's have some fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Foxy Brown]</i><br/>
Shit, she back with the nigga inf dot<br/>
Uh-oh, somebody better tell this broad<br/>
I'm a nine year veteran, I'm back with my breathren<br/>
I sware to god, it feel like '96 again<br/>
Bitches snatchin' bags, see, they fuckin' with my shit again<br/>
We bout to let them hammers pop<br/>
In the 'Stuy, dudes, callin', you a problem, Fox'<br/>
I got the automore pierre watch<br/>
Butterscotch, GT, good toe on, three eight cock<br/>
Ya'll ain't see this much love since they cried for 'Pac<br/>
Since Big passed, or since Jay passed the Roc<br/>
I'm in a clearport, full length mink in a G4<br/>
Fuck I'm lookin' like rhyming for a hundred g's, for?<br/>
No, I don't talk to media guys<br/>
I don't chatter with the best, ain't no question whose the best<br/>
Shawn and Kelly, Fox, best of both worlds, I see y'all<br/>
Aiyo, Kel, nigga, holler at your peoples<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Five, four, three, two, one<br/>
Hang on y'all, let's have some fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
