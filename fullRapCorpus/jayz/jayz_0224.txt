Kill Jay-Z, they'll never love you<br/>
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, Jay-Z<br/>
Fuck Jay-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother<br/>
How can we know if we can trust Jay-Z?<br/>
And you know better, nigga, I know you do<br/>
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue<br/>
You had no father, you had the armor<br/>
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer<br/>
Die Jay-Z, this ain't back in the days<br/>
You don't need an alibi, Jay-Z<br/>
Cry Jay-Z, we know the pain is real<br/>
But you can't heal what you never reveal<br/>
What's up, Jay-Z?<br/>
You know you owe the truth to all the youth<br/>
That fell in love with Jay-Z<br/>
You got people you love you sold drugs to<br/>
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you!<br/>
You walkin' around like you invincible<br/>
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles<br/>
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too<br/>
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural<br/>
But you ain't a Saint, this ain't KumbaYe<br/>
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye<br/>
You gave him 20 million without blinkin'<br/>
He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?<br/>
"Fuck wrong with everybody?" is what you sayin'<br/>
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's in sane<br/>
Crazy how life works<br/>
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts<br/>
You stabbed Un over some records<br/>
Your excuse was "He was talkin' too reckless!"<br/>
Let go your ego over your right shoulder<br/>
Your left is sayin', "Finish your breakfast!"<br/>
You egged Solange on<br/>
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong<br/>
You almost went Eric Benét<br/>
Let the baddest girl in the world get away<br/>
I don't even know what else to say<br/>
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!<br/>
I don't even know what you woulda done<br/>
In the Future, other niggas playin' football with your son<br/>
You wouldv'e lost it<br/>
13 bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston<br/>
Nah, Jay-Z<br/>
Bye, Jay-Z
