<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Check the bassline out, uh-huh<br/>
Jigga (bounce wit it), uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh, yeahh<br/>
Let it bump though<br/>
<br/>
<i>["Annie" sample]</i><br/>
It's the hard knock life (uh-huh) for us<br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us!!<br/>
Steada treated, we get tricked<br/>
Steada kisses, we get kicked<br/>
It's the hard knock life!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
From standin on the corners boppin<br/>
to drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen<br/>
For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard<br/>
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock<br/>
fleein the murder scene, you know me well<br/>
from nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell<br/>
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail?  Fuck naw<br/>
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots<br/>
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what-not<br/>
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not<br/>
let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot<br/>
let's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty, uh-huh<br/>
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh<br/>
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy<br/>
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!<br/>
You know it's hell when I come through<br/>
The life and times of Shawn Carter <br/>
nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>["Annie" sample]</i><br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us <br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us!!<br/>
Steada treated, we get tricked<br/>
Steada kisses, we get kicked<br/>
It's the hard knock life!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I flow for those 'dro'ed out; all my niggaz <br/>
locked down in the ten by fo', controllin the house<br/>
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks<br/>
Burn em down and you can have it back daddy, I'd rather that<br/>
I flow for chicks wishin, they ain't have to strip to pay tuition<br/>
I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots<br/>
All my ballers that's born to clock<br/>
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not<br/>
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots<br/>
to King Size, dream machines, the green fives<br/>
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills<br/>
Then I put it down type braile<br/>
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies<br/>
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit!<br/>
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin<br/>
I'm tryin to murder everything movin, feel me?!<br/>
<br/>
<i>["Annie" sample]</i><br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us <br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us!!<br/>
Steada treated, we get tricked<br/>
Steada kisses, we get kicked<br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us <br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us!!<br/>
Steada treated, we get tricked<br/>
Steada kisses, we get kicked<br/>
It's the hard knock life!! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I don't how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes<br/>
Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes<br/>
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress<br/>
you'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me<br/>
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out<br/>
Didn't really appreciate it, til the second one came out<br/>
So I stretched the game out, X'ed your name out<br/>
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, nigguh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>["Annie" sample]</i><br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us <br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us!!<br/>
Steada treated, we get tricked<br/>
Steada kisses, we get kicked<br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us <br/>
It's the hard knock life, for us!!<br/>
Steada treated, we get tricked<br/>
Steada kisses, we get kicked<br/>
It's the hard knock life!!<br/>
.. It's the hard knock life!!<br/>
.. It's the hard knock life!!
