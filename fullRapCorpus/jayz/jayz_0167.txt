<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uhh, woo!<br/>

Told you I ain't too good with writin letters and all<br/>

Vibe with me<br/>

<i>[Chorus: John Legend]</i><br/>

Some places we can go, some places we can go<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z - over Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh-huh, uh-huh<br/>
Yeah nigga I bet we was kids and had dreams of bein here<br/>
I said "we" cause I'm here, you here!<br/>
Uhh<br/>
Yeah, ride with me, your spot is reserved family<br/>
Cigarette boats, yachts, ain't nowhere we can't go<br/>
We in South Beach and the Hamptons too baby!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
You know why they call The Projects a project, because it's a project!<br/>
An experiment, where in it, only it's objects<br/>
And the object for us to explore our prospects<br/>
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!<br/>
As kids we would daydream, sittin on our steps<br/>
Pointin at cars like yeah that's our sex<br/>
Hustlers, prophets, made our eyes stretch<br/>
Swanson got the spot, shit we started our trek<br/>
Some of us made it, most of us digressed<br/>
In the name of those who ain't made it my progress<br/>
Show success please live through me<br/>
See I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive<br/>
(This is a collect call) So everytime I press five<br/>
All he wanna hear is his boy talk fly<br/>
Up in the fed, and still holdin his head<br/>
So when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread<br/>
Now let's ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z - over Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh-huh, geah<br/>
I'm crushin 'em all for Jones<br/>
MTV, BET, the Grammys, crushed linen, purple label<br/>
All that fly shit we talked about<br/>
Give him some nice pinky rings with the blue diamonds and e'rything<br/>
Hehehe, that's what we talked about right?<br/>
Uh-huh... tried to told you, ride with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
International Hov', I told you so<br/>
Forty 40's out in Tokyo<br/>
Singapore, all this from singin songs<br/>
Comin up though we thought slingin raw<br/>
was the end all be all of bein rich didn't we<br/>
Little did I know my mo' potent delivery<br/>
would deliver me, kingpin of the inkpen<br/>
Monster of the double entendre, Coke is still my sponsor<br/>
Heh, the Cola, yeah<br/>
Hova still gettin it in with soda<br/>
Diet, no sir, I ain't lose no weight<br/>
Started from the crates now I'm sittin on a whole case<br/>
Since they got you sittin on that old case<br/>
Our dreams is on hold like Tivo<br/>
So I can't wait 'til you get your date<br/>
I got some temp plates outside of the gate<br/>
We gon' ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z - over Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh-huh, uh-huh<br/>
Geah<br/>
Don't even worry about it though, you ain't missed nuttin<br/>
It only gets better, they got the Maybach Coupe now<br/>
Look like the Batmobile, the Phantom the top just comes off that joint<br/>
It only gets better<br/>
They caught your body they can't trap your mind<br/>
Keep your spirit alive read your books<br/>
Matter of fact, let me take you somewhere<br/>
Vibe with me, c'mon<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
