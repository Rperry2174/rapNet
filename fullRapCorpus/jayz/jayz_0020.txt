I'm done talking<br/>
Ran up in the spot gun smoking<br/>
Shot it in the air, one woke him<br/>
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo<br/>
Thinking to himself what done provoked him<br/>
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan<br/>
I swear I saw a lightbulb when<br/>
He finally figured out who was the culprit<br/>
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when<br/>
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more<br/>
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down<br/>
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now<br/>
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize<br/>
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be<br/>
Plus I had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys<br/>
And it wasn't afterthought that maybe you'll try to revenge me<br/>
But I was like "Nah", Chromes had to know he was wrong<br/>
And if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song<br/>
Plus you promised<br/>
And that's really no fun <br/>
Yeah I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns<br/>
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms<br/>
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon<br/>
But my mind's like a flower in bloom<br/>
*** my eyes just scower the room<br/>
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out<br/>
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a 2 hotel town? <br/>
Come on now, I peep your Lexus at you<br/>
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town<br/>
Money well invested, rudely interrupted<br/>
Jamaican accents *** <br/>
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?<br/>
I'm done talking, back up and clap them, one in the abdomen <br/>
Do me a favor dude, get 2 ice cubes I pass them<br/>
Take that ice up, for the nicest MC<br/>
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable <br/>
Friend or foe BIOTCH!
