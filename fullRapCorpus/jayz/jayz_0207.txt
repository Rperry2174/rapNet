<i>[Verse 1 - Justin Timberlake:]</i><br/>
You take the clothes off my back<br/>
And I let you<br/>
You'd steal the food right out my mouth<br/>
And I'd watch you eat it<br/>
I still don't know why<br/>
Why I love you so much<br/>
Oh<br/>
(Thanks for warning me <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
You curse my name<br/>
In spite to put me to shame<br/>
Have my laundry in the streets<br/>
Dirty or clean<br/>
Give it up for fame<br/>
But I still don't know why<br/>
Why I love it so much<br/>
(Thanks for warning me <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And baby<br/>
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you<br/>
I just can't crack your code<br/>
One day you screaming you love me loud<br/>
The next day you're so cold<br/>
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care<br/>
You're so unfair sipping from your cup<br/>
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
(Uh) Blue told me to remind you niggas (uh)<br/>
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' about<br/>
I'm the nigga (uh), caught up in all these lights and cameras (uh)<br/>
But look what that shit did to Hammer (uh)<br/>
God damn it I like it<br/>
Bright lights is enticing<br/>
But look what it did to Tyson<br/>
All that money in one night<br/>
30 mill for one fight<br/>
But soon as all that money blows, all the pigeons take flight<br/>
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me<br/>
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice<br/>
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that<br/>
Enough to make me wanna murder<br/>
Momma please just get my bail<br/>
I know nobody to blame<br/>
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Justin Timberlake:]</i><br/>
And we all just entertainers<br/>
And we're stupid, and contagious<br/>
Now we all just entertainers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Justin Timberlake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Now I got tattoos on my body<br/>
Psycho bitches in my lobby<br/>
I got haters in the paper<br/>
Photo shoots with paparazzi<br/>
Can't even take my daughter for a walk<br/>
See 'em by the corner store<br/>
I feel like I'm cornered off<br/>
Enough is enough<br/>
I'm calling this off<br/>
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?<br/>
I'm getting high<br/>
Sitting low<br/>
Sliding by<br/>
In that big body<br/>
Curtains all in my window<br/>
This fame hurt<br/>
But this chain works<br/>
I think back<br/>
You asked the same person<br/>
If this is all you had to deal with<br/>
Nigga deal with<br/>
It, this shit ain't work<br/>
This light work<br/>
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt<br/>
Niggas dying back where I was birthed<br/>
Fuck your iris and the IRS<br/>
Get the hell up off of your high horse<br/>
You got the shit that niggas die for<br/>
Dry yours<br/>
Why you mad<br/>
Take the good with the bad<br/>
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water<br/>
You're still alive<br/>
Still that nigga<br/>
Nigga you survived<br/>
You still getting bigger nigga<br/>
Living the life<br/>
Vanilla wafers<br/>
In a villa<br/>
Illest nigga alive<br/>
Michael Jackson's, Thriller<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Justin Timberlake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it<br/>
And you take the blade right out my heart just so you can watch me bleed it<br/>
And I still don't know why<br/>
Why I love you so much<br/>
(Thanks for warning me)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
(Thanks for warning me)<br/>
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane<br/>
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess whose name<br/>
But I still don't know why<br/>
Why I love it so much, yeah.<br/>
(Thanks for warning me <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Don't know why...
