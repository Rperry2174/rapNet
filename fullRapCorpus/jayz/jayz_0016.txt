<i>[somebody whispering]</i><br/>
Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground<br/>
I ain't panicked, I been here before<br/>
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage<br/>
In front of that crowd<br/>
And showed them who was who, and what was what<br/>
Man look at these suckers<br/>
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler<br/>
It just so happens that I know how to rap<br/>
Okay, I'm reloaded!<br/>
(music drops in)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I did it again niggaz<br/>
Fucked up, right? I know<br/>
I know what y'all niggaz asking yourself<br/>
Is he gonna ever fall off?<br/>
No...<br/>
<br/>
...a lot of speculation<br/>
on the monies I've made, honeys I've slayed<br/>
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?<br/>
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct<br/>
Is it true he slay the beef and slept with a tech?<br/>
What's the position you hold? Can you really match<br/>
a triple platinum artist buck by buck by only a single goin gold?<br/>
Roc-A-Fella ship fold, and you're left out in the cold<br/>
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O<br/>
For the millionth time askin me<br/>
Questions like Wendy Williams, harrassin me<br/>
then get upset when I catch feelings<br/>
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave<br/>
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinnin on my sleeve<br/>
Uh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?<br/>
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?<br/>
What you doin in L.A., with phillipinos and ese's<br/>
Latinos and Cheve's, down by Pico withh Frederico<br/>
I answer all your questions but then y'all got to go<br/>
Now the question I ask you is how bad you want to know? BLAOW!<br/>
<br/>
Roc-A-Fella y'all, uhh, uh<br/>
Know my style<br/>
<br/>
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, bout crime no more<br/>
Til I'm no more, cause I'm so raw<br/>
My flow expose holes that they find in yours<br/>
Wasn't for me, niggaz still be dying for whores<br/>
But I hate when a nigga sit back, admirin yours<br/>
Young blood you better get that, we frying baccars<br/>
Niggaz don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse<br/>
And don't listen to the rappers, they dying to floss<br/>
I used to be O.T., applyin the force<br/>
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss<br/>
Come back with the click playing Diana Ross<br/>
I'm the boss and this is how it's gonna be<br/>
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V<br/>
I got mouths to feed till they put flowers on me<br/>
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise<br/>
Tombstone read 'He Was Holdin No Leaks'<br/>
Started from the crack game and then so sweet<br/>
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the old-G<br/>
On MTV, telling em how I sold D<br/>
And used to back work up out of apartment 4-B<br/>
Me and my homie, started out coldies<br/>
Picked the mailbox lock cause I ain't have no key<br/>
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'<br/>
Then I went low key, but now I'm back it's on<br/>
Motherfuckers<br/>
Jigga, uh-huh, yeah<br/>
Roc-A-Fella y'all<br/>
Uhh, feel this
