<i>[the Jay-Z and Tariq verses are from Shaquille O'Neal's "No Love Lost"]</i><br/>
<br/>
what the hell...what the hell...<br/>
check check check check it out<br/>
what the hell...what the hell...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1: Lord Tariq]</i><br/>
<br/>
People know me on these streets player, I ain't new<br/>
Lookin at me all funny, while I'm countin my money<br/>
Suprise, what I do is already legalized<br/>
Analyze what I toss across, ain't no love lost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Fo' sure, everythings for dough now<br/>
flow, you gotta pay a little more now<br/>
It's platinum, now a days we put the gold down<br/>
We stepped it up, y'all don't ever want a showdown<br/>
Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the Bezzle out<br/>
Y'all don't like it? Sue me, fuck I'll settle out<br/>
Ghetto'd out in the vehicle Bent<br/>
These days I mellowed out, see success make a fella content<br/>
Uh-huh, you know, this rap star, Poppy Chulo<br/>
Jay-Z, Hugo, of course player you lost player<br/>
I know you rappers wanna see me fail<br/>
But quick to see a 600SL be twelve<br/>
Live wit it, y'all got dough to get get it<br/>
I got mine, your little bit of money couldn't stop mine<br/>
Your block time, too hot, too many hands in your pie<br/>
Seventy thirty, the nigga you work for work for me<br/>
Bottom line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
People know me on these streets and the towns I been through<br/>
Lookin at me, stay focused, I'm givin em straight poker suprise<br/>
What I do is already legalized<br/>
Analyze how I floss of course, ain't no love lost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lord Tariq]</i><br/>
We be the Bronx to BK'lyn, togethor we about a ton or better<br/>
on the way in, we rhyme related, very underestimated<br/>
That's why I'm winnin in this world of sins<br/>
Steady grinnin, money boss spendin<br/>
Distant from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influencial<br/>
Spiritualy and mental, what you into I done been through<br/>
Preachin my words and don't know what you owe<br/>
It shows you wanna be me, but won't show it<br/>
Ain't nothin changed, but players, the game remains the same<br/>
I had a ten year run, hey I can't complain<br/>
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi<br/>
From the bx weed, ridin the south beach on jet-ski<br/>
Play to survive, you ain't live you just livin<br/>
You breathin a good one, but where I'm from, y'all forbidden<br/>
Come around, bad decision, you rather be in prison<br/>
aint' no duckin what I'm deliverin won't be forgivin in<br/>
Layin there shiverin, half the night<br/>
You gotta walk toward the light, everything is aiight<br/>
I make sure everything you endure stays tight<br/>
Big <i>[boom]</i> Lord Tariq, Jay-Z, outta sight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I spend nights on corners, see the crack, cop my first mac<br/>
No longer scared to pump what y'all pump, now I burst back<br/>
It hurts that, don't seem cream can make my purse fat<br/>
Without the benefits of a doubt, I hit the hearst black<br/>
But curse that, tryin to see Nas was your worst match<br/>
Blowin like Tahitii, throw off NYPD<br/>
Am I greedy? like I mean EDC me<br/>
In a fly Salinii gimme frames in the beanie<br/>
I flip my loot twice a week on my most trifest streets<br/>
You got no right to eat by the laws of life you keep<br/>
Ain't no love lost, none taken, none givin<br/>
Stressin how I'm livin it, thinkin when my loot first came<br/>
look what I did with it, bought my click glaciers<br/>
and pagers, rollin ten deep to Las Vegas<br/>
Copped a live croc, chopped it up, hit my block off<br/>
wit gators, feedin peoples, from the bridge to Dequatas<br/>
But now, two years five months and 30 days later<br/>
I still put out the street flavor<br/>
But watch that kid right there, a bulge in his night wear<br/>
Awoke me up the ways I used to be in my heist years<br/>
Bubble eye small fry loaded four five<br/>
just thirstin for some person with shine to just walk by<br/>
Now that I can see the 360, now that its me thats jiggy<br/>
them cooly heads they wanna stick me, whoa
