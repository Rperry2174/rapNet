Uh-huh, yeah hah<br/>
Never Sprung huh?<br/>
Jigga, Roc-a-Fella y'all<br/>
Never Sprung huh?<br/>
Yeah, peep the repertoire<br/>
Peoples, feel me on this one<br/>
Peoples, feel this<br/>
Never Sprung huh? Know my style<br/>
<br/>
I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches<br/>
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches<br/>
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches<br/>
Can't Knock Your Hustle for real, exotic bitches<br/>
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum french<br/>
frames with the french name in the same night<br/>
Pull you and your tight friend<br/>
lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in<br/>
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R<br/>
Sexin in a Lexus car<br/>
Match wits with the best of y'all the rest of y'all<br/>
is like vege-tables in my presence, check it<br/>
Reminescin to nuttin you ever heard, Iceberg<br/>
Slim baby ride rims through the suburbs<br/>
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred<br/>
Get money like I'm down South Wednesday the 3rd, it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Dough to get, more shows to rip<br/>
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit<br/>
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick<br/>
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit<br/>
<br/>
Can't scheme on em, Roc-a-Fella got a team on em<br/>
Chicks dream on him trick cream on him<br/>
Lose it when dudes think it's just music<br/>
Lean on em flash green on em and diamond rings on em<br/>
Sex around the way girls down to mida's<br/>
I'm somethin every girl gotta have like Levi's<br/>
Chiquita, me got more, see I brawl<br/>
You can love me or hate me, either or<br/>
I'ma stay winnin, rock the custom drop Bentleys<br/>
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil Penny<br/>
can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave<br/>
just as quick, indian give, ha-hah<br/>
Now what I look like? Givin a chick half my trap<br/>
like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin that<br/>
you be the same chick when you leave me<br/>
the bankbook and the credit cards and take everything you came wit chorus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Here's somethin niggaz gon find, not at all funny<br/>
We takin all ya bitches, takin all ya money<br/>
Jay-Z rated A.G. baby that's All Good<br/>
I sink this ball in your hole, I'm Tiger Woods<br/>
If the money was the grass and your ass was tee<br/>
when I hit it with this club love you comin with me<br/>
Grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall<br/>
Kinda tipsy, seein triple, so I'm fuckin ya all<br/>
You remind me of this dream I had the night before<br/>
I'm kinda hopin the condom break to have a reason to go raw<br/>
I'm playin, hit the showers, hit the money spot<br/>
Where all the models play and big money is dropped<br/>
Drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her<br/>
She jumped all in my seat like some private dancer<br/>
I tell you somethin new, if you don't hop down off that<br/>
butter soft shit with your shoes, I'ma step on the gas<br/>
She laughed, put her ass back in the proper place<br/>
She said, 'I played my cards right and look I got the ace'<br/>
I told her (beatboxes) 'Slow down baby'<br/>
You dealin with a baller, who, hold ground crazy it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Beyatch! Fucka<br/>
Jigga, nine-seven shit, next millenia<br/>
Recognize, realize, it's on<br/>
Roc the block y'all<br/>
Laugh<br/>
It's on
