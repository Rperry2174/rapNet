<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
"Presidents to represent me" - <i>[Nas]</i><br/>
"Get money!"<br/>
"I'm out for presidents to represent me" "Get money!"<br/>
"I'm out for presidents to represent me" "Get money!"<br/>
"I'm out for dead *fuckin* presidents to represent me (Whose...)"<br/>
<br/>
Rock... on, Roc-A-Fella y'all<br/>
The saga continues<br/>
<br/>
Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch leathers<br/>
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous all the et ceteras<br/>
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine<br/>
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggaz just rhyme<br/>
By the ounce dough accumulates like snow<br/>
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show; you feel me?<br/>
Factions from the other side would love to kill me<br/>
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat<br/>
Fuck em, we hate a nigga lovin this life<br/>
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin my life<br/>
Hospital days, reflectin when my man laid up<br/>
On the Uptown high block he got his side sprayed up<br/>
I saw his life slippin, this is a minor set back<br/>
Yo, still in all we livin, just dream about the get back<br/>
That made him smile though his eyes said, "Pray for me"<br/>
I'll do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully<br/>
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process<br/>
and I ain't got nothin but time<br/>
I had near brushes, not to mention three shots<br/>
close range, never touched me, divine intervention<br/>
Can't stop I, from drinkin Mai-Tai's, with Ta Ta<br/>
Down in Nevada, ha ha, Poppa, word life<br/>
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight<br/>
Potnah, I'm still spendin money from eighty-eight... what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Geyeah, know what? I'll make..<br/>
you and your wack mans fold like bad hands<br/>
Roll like Monopoly, ad-vance you copy me<br/>
like white crystals, I gross the most<br/>
at the end of the fiscal year than these niggaz can wish to<br/>
The dead presidential, canidate<br/>
with the sprinkles and the presidental, ice that'll offend you<br/>
In due time when crime fleas my mind<br/>
All sneak thieves and playa haters can shine<br/>
But until then I keep the trillion cut diamonds shinin brilliant<br/>
I'll tell you half the story, the rest you fill it in<br/>
Long as the villian win<br/>
I spend Japan yen, attend major events<br/>
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin<br/>
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin, manipulatin<br/>
I got a good life man, pounds and pence<br/>
Nuff dollars make sense, while you ride the bench<br/>
Catch me swinging for the fence<br/>
Dead Presidents, ya know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, so be it<br/>
The Soviet, The Unified Steady Flow<br/>
You already know, you light I'm heavy roll, heavy dough<br/>
Mic macheted your flow, your paper falls slow<br/>
like confetti, mines a steady grow, bet he glow<br/>
Pay five dead it from blow, better believe I have<br/>
eleven sixty to show, my doe flip like Tae-Kwon<br/>
Jay-Z The Icon, baby, you like Dom, maybe this Cristal's<br/>
to change your life huh, roll with the winners<br/>
Heavy spenders like hit records: Roc-A-Fella<br/>
Don't get it corrected this shit is perfected <br/>
from chips to chicks just drivin a Lexus<br/>
Make it without your gun, we takin everything you brung<br/>
We cake and you niggaz is fake and we gettin it done<br/>
Crime Family, well connected Jay-Z<br/>
And you fake thugs is Unplugged like MTV<br/>
I empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure<br/>
Dead presidentials, politics as usual<br/>
Bla-ouw!<br/>
<br/>
"Dead (fuckin) presidents to represent me (Whose...)"<br/>
"Dead (fuckin) presidents to represent me (Whose...)"<br/>
"Dead (fuckin) presidents to represent me (Whose...)"<br/>
"Dead (fuckin) presidents to represent me (Whose...)"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
