I ordered a frappuccino<br/>
Where's my fuckin frappuccino<br/>
Alright, let's do this<br/>
<br/>
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be<br/>
I look exactly like what you always wanted to see<br/>
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am<br/>
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but<br/>
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay I'm just<br/>
Trying to bend the truth<br/>
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be, so I'm<br/>
Lying my way from <br/>
<br/>
If you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off<br/>
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off<br/>
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you<br/>
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder<br/>
<br/>
I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force<br/>
Tryin to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche<br/>
Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced<br/>
Middle finger to the law, nigga grip'n my balls<br/>
All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin<br/>
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin<br/>
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin<br/>
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it<br/>
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pots<br/>
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block<br/>
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block<br/>
I can run it back nigga cause I'm straight with the Roc<br/>
<br/>
If you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off<br/>
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off<br/>
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you<br/>
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder<br/>
<br/>
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder<br/>
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder<br/>
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder<br/>
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder<br/>
<br/>
Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda<br/>
I just whipped up a watch, tryin to get me a Rover<br/>
Tryin to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir<br/>
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya<br/>
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin<br/>
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em<br/>
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling<br/>
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin<br/>
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve<br/>
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen<br/>
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean<br/>
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me<br/>
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be<br/>
Remember listening to all of that and this again<br/>
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in<br/>
And now you think this person really is me and I'm<br/>
Trying to bend the truth<br/>
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away 'cuz I'm<br/>
<br/>
Lying my way from you<br/>
No no turning back now<br/>
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go<br/>
No no turning back now<br/>
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone<br/>
No turning back now<br/>
Anywhere on my own cuz I can see<br/>
No no turning back now<br/>
The very worst part of you<br/>
The very worst part of you is ME<br/>
<br/>
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would<br/>
have you running from me<br/>
Like This<br/>
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would<br/>
have you running from me<br/>
Like This<br/>
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would<br/>
have you running from me<br/>
Like This<br/>
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would<br/>
have you running from me<br/>
Like This<br/>
<br/>
You<br/>
No turning back now<br/>
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go<br/>
No no turning back now<br/>
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone<br/>
No turning back now<br/>
Anywhere on my own cuz I can see<br/>
No no turning back now<br/>
The very worst part of you<br/>
The very worst part of you is me<br/>
<br/>
Beeitch
