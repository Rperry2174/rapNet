<i>[Chorus: Gwen Dickey]</i><br/>
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are<br/>
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club<br/>
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above<br/>
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club<br/>
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut<br/>
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in<br/>
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems<br/>
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes<br/>
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies<br/>
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong<br/>
Had to get our shit together and move it along<br/>
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas<br/>
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Gwen Dickey]</i><br/>
Wishing on a star to follow where you are<br/>
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit<br/>
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"<br/>
Maintanin, it's the same old thang<br/>
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed<br/>
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement<br/>
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down<br/>
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down<br/>
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?<br/>
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"<br/>
I was too deep for you from day one<br/>
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Gwen Dickey]</i><br/>
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are<br/>
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means<br/>
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see<br/>
I wish on all the people who really dream<br/>
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come<br/>
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks<br/>
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark<br/>
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample<br/>
Dangerous games we played on the third rail<br/>
Fiend for the summer breeze<br/>
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares<br/>
into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports<br/>
to take us away from here, but I cut too much<br/>
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush<br/>
My sinners used to back me up<br/>
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me<br/>
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll<br/>
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Gwen Dickey]</i><br/>
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are<br/>
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means<br/>
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see<br/>
I wish on all the people who really dream<br/>
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come<br/>
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done
