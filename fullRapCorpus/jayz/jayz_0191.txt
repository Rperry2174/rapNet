I'm from the 80's, <br/>
Home of the heroine,<br/>
Error of the hustlers, uh<br/>
The world is my custy<br/>
New rich porter<br/>
The way I flip quarters<br/>
Front on all these other rap artists, but me<br/>
Momma was a mink wearer, Papa ran numbers<br/>
So it's plain to see, where my whole plan come from<br/>
American dream, I'm living the life still<br/>
The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill<br/>
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining<br/>
40 below timbs on, getting my M's on<br/>
My best friends gone, I seen bad days<br/>
Still find songs that I hear him on<br/>
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on<br/>
I hear his voice in my mind, like, nigga live on<br/>
So I get on that fly shit I been on<br/>
Spin on corners in enzo with rims on<br/>
But for info, puffin on Endo-Nesia<br/>
Give me amnesia<br/>
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga<br/>
I want the sky, <br/>
The world when I'm done<br/>
I'm give it to my sons<br/>
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, <br/>
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done<br/>
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame, a list of hits next to all my names<br/>
I came, if the sky should fall<br/>
And it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house and auction off all my cars<br/>
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the beamer<br/>
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina<br/>
In Ibiza I had pizza in the club<br/>
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love<br/>
Now they wanna ya boy like Mike in his prime<br/>
Billie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine<br/>
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope<br/>
Can't lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes<br/>
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's<br/>
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo<br/>
Rose gold rose flow, I'm okay though<br/>
What Don't kill me makes stronger than before so<br/>
Here we go and I'm not domino<br/>
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw<br/>
I might break but I don't fold, till I hold the sky in my hand<br/>
Yeah that's my goal <br/>
And then I bid you Freddy Adu<br/>
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the future<br/>
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle<br/>
My name will be viewed such<br/>
Here's to the man that refused to give up<br/>
I want the sky nigga, Chuuuuuuch
