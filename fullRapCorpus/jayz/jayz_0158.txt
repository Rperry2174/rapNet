Jigga what, Jigga who?<br/>
Jigga what, Jigga who?<br/>
Jigga what, Jigga who?<br/>
<br/>
You gon' need a vocal in, right?<br/>
<br/>
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit em wit, numerous<br/>
shots with the fo'-fo'<br/>
Faggots wanna talk to Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa<br/>
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload<br/>
Fuck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed<br/>
Left holes through some guy clothes<br/>
Stop your bullshittin, glock with the full clip<br/>
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit<br/>
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip<br/>
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit<br/>
Oh hey ma, how you, know niggaz wanna buy you<br/>
But see me I wanna Fuck for Free like Akinyele<br/>
Now I gotta let her take this ride, make you feel it<br/>
inside your belly, if it's tight get the K-Y Jelly<br/>
All night get you wide up inside the telly<br/>
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me<br/>
<br/>
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard<br/>
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact that everyone can see<br/>
these scars<br/>
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel<br/>
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe<br/>
this is real<br/>
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do<br/>
Face away and pretend that I'm not<br/>
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got<br/>
<br/>
Got a condo with nuttin but condoms in it<br/>
The same place where the rhymes is invented<br/>
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke<br/>
See how I was flowin on my last cassette?<br/>
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a Tec, never jam though<br/>
Never get high, never run out of ammo<br/>
Niggaz hatin n shit cause I slayed your bitch<br/>
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick<br/>
And now you're, actin raw but you never had war<br/>
Don't know how to carry your hoe, wanna marry your hoe<br/>
Now she's mad at me, causer Your Majesty, just happened to be<br/>
A pimp with a tragedy<br/>
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked with friends<br/>
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again<br/>
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, "Shit..<br/>
there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"<br/>
<br/>
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident<br/>
Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make<br/>
sense<br/>
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt<br/>
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear<br/>
me out<br/>
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do<br/>
Face away and pretend that I'm not<br/>
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got<br/>
<br/>
I can't feel the way I did before<br/>
Don't turn your back on me<br/>
I won't be ignored<br/>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br/>
Don't turn your back on me<br/>
I won't be ignored<br/>
<br/>
No<br/>
Hear me out now<br/>
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br/>
Right now<br/>
Hear me out now<br/>
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br/>
Right now<br/>
<br/>
I can't feel the way I did before<br/>
Don't turn your back on me<br/>
I won't be ignored<br/>
<br/>
I can't feel the way I did before<br/>
Don't turn your back on me<br/>
I won't be ignored<br/>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br/>
Don't turn your back on me<br/>
I won't be ignored<br/>
<br/>
I can't feel<br/>
Don't turn your back on me<br/>
I won't be ignored<br/>
Time won't heal<br/>
Don't turn your back on me<br/>
I won't be ignored
