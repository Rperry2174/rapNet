<i>[Jay]</i> It's the Roc!<br/>

<i>[Jay]</i> R.O., R.O.C. niggaz, R.O.<br/>
Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga<br/>
<i>[Jay]</i> Hov'! R.O.C. niggaz, R.O., whoo!<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Come on the track duh duh da-da<br/>
With a throwback jersey and a fitted<br/>
Might blow a bag of hershey in the sidd-ix<br/>
Or might take sips of army with a chidd-ick, I'm so sick widdit<br/>
Lampin in the Hamptons, the weekends man<br/>
The Stan Smith Adidas and the Campers<br/>
Or playin guts on the cruise, Hermes bow shoes<br/>
The Izod bucket on I'm so old school<br/>
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops<br/>
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?<br/>
J-A, ladies help me say it now<br/>
Y-Z, mami why you playin with me?<br/>
Ride with me, get high as me<br/>
It's how it's supposed to be, when you rollin with G's, Hov'!<br/>
Back up in this bitch like whoa<br/>
Jigga get this whole bitch jumpin like six-fo's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Hov'!) V is I, and I am him<br/>
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)<br/>
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty inch rims<br/>
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)<br/>
And if y'all got love for me I got love for y'all<br/>
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)<br/>
And if y'all go to war for me I go to war wit y'all<br/>
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hov'!  And so I breeze through, jeans is Evisu<br/>
She's respondin, top of C. Bronson<br/>
We in Luan (whoo!) gettin our groove on<br/>
Buyin out the bar, on our way to Spa'<br/>
She never seen a hundred on the wrist before<br/>
Never seen twenty-two's on the 6 before<br/>
I am, killin 'em out there, they needin first aid<br/>
Cause the boy got more 6's than first grade<br/>
The crib got, killer views and square feet<br/>
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week<br/>
So, sleep if you need to, mami I will leave you<br/>
Right where you stand, nah I don't wanna dance (I'm good)<br/>
I just wanna see what's in your Frankie V pants<br/>
Waist is low enough to let your waist show<br/>
Top like a rock star, I got a fast car<br/>
We can cruise the city, doin a buck-sixty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
"He did it again!"  Haters no like<br/>
But they gotta fuck with it cause the flow's so tight<br/>
Gnarly dude!  I puff Bob Marley dude<br/>
All day, like Rastafari's do<br/>
Now I'm stuck to the point I could hardly move<br/>
You fuckin up my high, don't bother me dude<br/>
But Red Rover, send your hoes over<br/>
She can do WHATEVER, sip somethin with soda<br/>
She can leave WHENEVER, sip somethin with Hova<br/>
We can play HOWEVER, slay bed or sofa<br/>
And the prognosis, sex is explosive<br/>
Left her with wet bedsheets, nigga I'm focused<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
R.O., R.O.C. niggaz..<br/>
R.O.C. niggaz<br/>
(Roc-A-Fella y'all!)
