WHOO!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Memph' Bleek always smokin that la-la-la (HOO)<br/>
Beanie Sigel always smokin that la-la-la (HOO)<br/>
Kanye track smoke like la-la-la (HOO)<br/>
It's the R.O.C. mami, sing our lullaby<br/>
C'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I know my English ain't as modest as you like<br/>
But come, get some, you little bums<br/>
I take the cake from under the baker's thumbs<br/>
I bake the cake, get two of them for one<br/>
Then I move the weight like I'm Oprah's son<br/>
Uh, I'll show you how to do this son<br/>
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry paddings<br/>
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (u-uh)<br/>
He padded hisself the rap J.F.K., you wanna pass for my Jaqueline Onassis<br/>
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class<br/>
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask<br/>
Have you in your long-legged life<br/>
ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?<br/>
Look but don't touch, motherfucker think twice<br/>
'Cause the gat that I clutch got a little red light<br/>
Need a light?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
To smoke that la-la-la<br/>
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la-la-la<br/>
Memph' Bleek always smoking that la-la-la<br/>
It's the R.O.C. mami, sing our lullaby<br/>
C'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
We got brothers full of Arm'i, mami's in Manolo<br/>
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos<br/>
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough<br/>
When they see him, whips be European<br/>
If you're a ten, chances you're with him<br/>
If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them<br/>
Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him<br/>
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction<br/>
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin'<br/>
You can't rain dance on his picnic<br/>
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness<br/>
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you CB-4<br/>
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch<br/>
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Still smokin that la-la-la<br/>
Memph' Bleek still smokin that la-la-la<br/>
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five<br/>
It's the R.O.C. baby, sing our lullaby<br/>
C'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Kanye West]</i><br/>
She playin she hate when I'm name droppin<br/>
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics<br/>
But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out<br/>
Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother<br/>
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?<br/>
Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group<br/>
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo<br/>
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals<br/>
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials<br/>
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential<br/>
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential<br/>
That have fun breakin her fundamentals<br/>
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium<br/>
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium<br/>
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney<br/>
and Remi and weed, 'til she higher than Hilliam<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la<br/>
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la<br/>
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five<br/>
It's the R.O.C. bitch, sing our lullaby<br/>
C'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit<br/>
You should come, hang with me, basically<br/>
WHOA, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami
