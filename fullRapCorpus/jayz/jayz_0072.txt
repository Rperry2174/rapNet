<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeh, it's that knock right here<br/>
You fuck around not have the right speakers in your system<br/>
your shit be soundin like this <i>[funny sounds]</i><br/>
<br/>
Big thangs, thick chains, ain't shit changed<br/>
Get brain in the four-dot-six Range<br/>
Shit mayn, switch lanes<br/>
Every town I hit you switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine<br/>
<br/>
I givin 'em whiplash when I'm whippin the whip fast<br/>
Which one? Pick one nigga, I got a six stashed<br/>
Continental T's, no tense like I got a thick stab<br/>
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny<br/>
Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's<br/>
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass<br/>
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels<br/>
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill<br/>
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard<br/>
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard<br/>
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad<br/>
Spin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage<br/>
Just Mac ?? God, the sunlight hit the ice it's flawless<br/>
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless<br/>
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office<br/>
Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es<br/>
When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious<br/>
Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers<br/>
'Specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous<br/>
Standin in the Azure with white air forces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: sung]</i><br/>
You can catch me in the parkin lot<br/>
Hollerin at bitches, parkin lot pimpin'<br/>
Everyday we be off the chains<br/>
Workin with grain, sittin on them thangs<br/>
Tryin to find out where dem dollars at (dollars at)<br/>
So when I holla at you, holla back (holla back)<br/>
Everyday we be off the chains<br/>
Ain't nuttin different, parkin lot pimpin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Holla at me mami! Sigel..<br/>
<br/>
You can catch Mac in the parkin lot, pimpin crazy<br/>
S-5, Navy 'Cedes, sittin on 80<br/>
That's four dubs, not S-4 dub<br/>
Stash box, push (Hot Wheel) like (Matchbox)<br/>
Bitches wanna push my world, they flash box<br/>
160, push my wheel, mash cops<br/>
Cause 160 took my wheel to cash drop<br/>
Run 60, you Big Will, match cop<br/>
Lookin through the rearview and Mac was wylin<br/>
New driver, screwdriver, the cracked steering column<br/>
Pushin somethin stolen, blastin, picture me rollin<br/>
Baghdad, couldn't picture me ??<br/>
Now the truth different, Mac come through Coupe roof missin<br/>
I'm the truth til my fuckin roof missin<br/>
Mac stay stuck in the Coupe to school pigeons<br/>
Feathers gettin plucked in the truck from loose chickens, listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Yo, aiyyo I dip dip dive, what can I say?<br/>
I can't fit 'em all inside the Escalade<br/>
So I called up, murder to further my parkin lot pimpin<br/>
Told 'em get the Impala so I can start dippin<br/>
Lay back, seat recline, they notice the hand<br/>
Car movin slow, driven by the invisible man<br/>
Everything on the dash, digital and<br/>
I got a fast stashbox don't make me spit at you man<br/>
In the parkin lot, where I spark a lot<br/>
I come to show my new feet, slide off with a few freaks<br/>
Bleek, turn up the beats..<br/>
.. turn up the heat then we burn up the streets, bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
