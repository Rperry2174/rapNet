Shout out to old Jews and old rules<br/>
New blacks with new stacks<br/>
I already been the king<br/>
Retro act, I'm just bringing it back<br/>
Like Jordan Packs<br/>
New money, they looking down on me<br/>
Blue bloods they trying to clown on me<br/>
You can turn up your nose high society<br/>
Never gone turn down the homie<br/>
Knock knock I'm at your neighbor house<br/>
Straight cash I bought ya neighbor out<br/>
You should come to the housewarming<br/>
Come and see what your new neighbor 'bout<br/>
Yellow Lambo in the driveway<br/>
A buck 35 on the highway<br/>
Frank Sinatra on my Sonos<br/>
Loud as fuck I did it my way<br/>
A million sold before the album dropped<br/>
White Lexus before I had a deal<br/>
Ask Bun B about me<br/>
This ain't no snap back, a nigga's been trill<br/>
By the way, fuck your math<br/>
You ain't gotta count it my nigga I can add<br/>
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 20 million<br/>
Oh, I'm so good at math<br/>
Might crash ya Internet<br/>
And I ain't even into that<br/>
When I was talking Instagram<br/>
Last thing you wanted was your picture snapped<br/>
Feds still lurking<br/>
They see I'm still putting work in<br/>
Cause somewhere in America<br/>
Miley Cyrus is still twerkin'<br/>
<br/>
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk<br/>
Twerk, Miley, Miley, twerk<br/>
Twerk,<br/>
Twerk, Miley, Miley, Miley, twerk<br/>
Twerk, yeah, ugh-huh<br/>
Twerk, Miley, Miley, Miley<br/>
Only in America
