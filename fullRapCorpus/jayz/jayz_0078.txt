<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Damn how am I gonna say this shit?<br/>
hey... hey dad, yeah it's your boy<br/>
remember me? I wanna talk to you scrap<br/>
<br/>
I remember being kicked out the house<br/>
'cause I looked just like you<br/>
Said I'd be nothing but a crook<br/>
just like you<br/>
The niggaz in the hood was shook<br/>
Where the just like you<br/>
'Cause all they said was little whitey look<br/>
I'm just like you<br/>
But dog I can't see it at all, shit<br/>
We never kicked it at all<br/>
We never pitched or kicked at a ball<br/>
dog, you never taught me shit<br/>
how to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat<br/>
none of that sorts of shit<br/>
Nigga you was an abusive pops<br/>
fuck you left me out to dry, stuck<br/>
gotta teach news to box<br/>
gotta teach news to bop<br/>
and that aint the half of it man<br/>
I gotta teach news to block<br/>
It's about time we have a father to son (nigga sit down)<br/>
sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons<br/>
how they grew to be men and father they sons<br/>
father they daughters<br/>
nigga, you left a fatherless daughter<br/>
I never follow your orders<br/>
nigga you make me sick<br/>
pussy you could....ooh<br/>
how you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind<br/>
I can see it clear as day you smackin my mom<br/>
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9<br/>
put it in my palm when I was young<br/>
and said that would be mine, you turned me out<br/>
the reason why I hit the block<br/>
reason why I tried to hit them cops<br/>
reason why I started hittin shots<br/>
reason why I started gettin licked<br/>
and drinkin syrup and skippin court<br/>
ginger bread man never think of gettin caught<br/>
look at your hand man damn you fought<br/>
nigga you left my mom<br/>
left us with no good-bye's<br/>
you left us out to dry<br/>
you left us with no letters, notes, (nothing!) no replies<br/>
no digits numbers was unlisted<br/>
you left us with some of my loneliest night<br/>
nigga some of my hungriest nights<br/>
shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrasin)<br/>
damn we used to think money was white<br/>
yeah you gave us life like, fruit from a plant<br/>
we aint eat right from them foods from them stamps<br/>
and to think you was my pop,<br/>
man i gotta stop shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<i>[Female:]</i> Daddy, Where Have You Been?<br/>
<i>[Beanie:]</i> And when you come home, you got us here all alone<br/>
<i>[Female:]</i> Mommy, Where Daddy Went?<br/>
<i>[Beanie:]</i> You always stick up for him<br/>
Always said you'd make up for him<br/>
<i>[Female:]</i> Mommy, What Happened Then?<br/>
<i>[Beanie:]</i> What was you cheatin on him?<br/>
Why he's always beatin' on you?<br/>
<i>[Female:]</i> Daddy, Where Have You Been?<br/>
<i>[Beanie:]</i> Nigga, you gonna hear me out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I wanted to walk just like him (remember?)<br/>
wanted to talk just like him (word)<br/>
often momma said I look too much<br/>
and I thought just like him (it could happen)<br/>
wanted to drink Miller nips<br/>
and smoke Newports just like you<br/>
but you left me, now I'm goin to court just like you<br/>
I would say "my daddy loves me and he'll never go away"<br/>
bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?<br/>
do you even remember the tender boy<br/>
you turned into a cold young man<br/>
with one goal and one plan<br/>
get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one<br/>
always short with the income<br/>
always late with the rent<br/>
You said that you was comin through<br/>
I would stay in the hallway (waitin)<br/>
always playin the bench (waitin)<br/>
and that day came and went<br/>
Fuck You! very much you showed me the worst kind of pain<br/>
but I'm stronger and trust me I will never hurt again<br/>
will never ask mommy "why daddy don't love me?<br/>
Why is we so poor?, why is life so ugly?<br/>
Mommy why is your eyes puffy?"<br/>
please don't cry everything'll be alright<br/>
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light<br/>
It's us against the world<br/>
we don't need him, right? (right)<br/>
mommy drivin 6's now (yeah), I got riches now (yeah)<br/>
I bought I nice home for both of my sisters now<br/>
we doin real good<br/>
we don't miss you now<br/>
see how life twists around, fucker?<br/>
<br/>
