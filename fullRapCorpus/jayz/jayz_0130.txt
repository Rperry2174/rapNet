<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
(Bitch) you know my name and the company I own<br/>
(Bitch) you like my style and you smell my cologne<br/>
(Bitch) don't try to act like my track-record ain't known<br/>
(Bitch) you probably gotta couple CD's in your home<br/>
(Bitch) don't make me say it twice, you acting all up tight<br/>
Also diddy like, like, like<br/>
You ain't a (Bitch), I ain't no ball player, you ain't gonna get pregnant again<br/>
Hit off with paper, you gonna get hit off and slid off<br/>
Before the neighbors take off to go to work<br/>
So just, take off your shirt, don't hit me with that church shit<br/>
(Bitch) I got a sister who schooled me to shit you chickens do<br/>
Tricking fools, got a whole Robin Givens crew that I kick it to<br/>
They be hipping dudes, how you chickens move, I be listening to<br/>
(Bitch) (Bitch) (Bitch)<br/>
Don't make me say it thrice, you acting all up tight<br/>
Also diddy like, like<br/>
You ain't a (Bitch), You ain't no better cuz you don't be fucking rappers<br/>
You only fuck with actors, you still getting fucked backwards<br/>
(Bitch) Unless you fucked a dude on his own merit<br/>
And not the way he dribbles or ball or draw leverage<br/>
You're a (Bitch), No ma, you're a (Bitch)<br/>

Say Jay-Z, why you gotta go and disrespect the women for? Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
(Bitch) Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve<br/>
SIsters work hard, bitches work your nerves<br/>
Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up<br/>
Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up<br/>
Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids<br/>
Bitches in street with their nose in your biz<br/>
Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies<br/>
Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride<br/>
Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give-up the ass<br/>
Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast<br/>
Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live<br/>
Bitches have niggers all up in your crib<br/>
Sisters tell you quick "you better check your homie"<br/>
Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie<br/>
Sisters love Jay cuz they know how 'Hov is<br/>
I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch
