You're now tuned into the motherfucking greatest<br/>
Turn the music up in the headphones<br/>
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off nigga<br/>
I got you, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
If you feeling like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off<br/>
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off<br/>
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you<br/>
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
I probably owe it to you all, proud to be locked by the force<br/>
Trying to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche<br/>
Feeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced<br/>
Middle finger to the law, nigga griping my balls<br/>
All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screaming<br/>
All the ballers is bouncing they like the way I be leaning<br/>
All the rappers be hating, off the track that I'm making<br/>
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it<br/>
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the "Top of the Pops"<br/>
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block<br/>
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block<br/>
I can run it back nigga 'cause I'm straight with the Roc<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Two]</i><br/>
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder<br/>
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder<br/>
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder<br/>
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda<br/>
I just whipped up a watch, trying to get me a Rover<br/>
Trying to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes sir<br/>
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test you<br/>
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealing<br/>
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em<br/>
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling<br/>
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chilling<br/>
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve<br/>
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen<br/>
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean<br/>
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus + Chorus Two]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Your boy back in the building, Brooklyn we back on the map<br/>
Me and my beautiful beeeeeeeitch in the back of that 'Bach<br/>
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap<br/>
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black<br/>
I drop that +Black, Album+ then I back, out it<br/>
As the best rapper alive nigga ask about me<br/>
From Bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammies<br/>
The O's to opposite, Orphan Annie<br/>
You gotta pardon Jay, for selling out the Garden in a day<br/>
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey<br/>
I'm a hustler homey, you a customer crony<br/>
Got some, dirt on my shoulder, could you brush it off for me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus + Chorus Two]</i><br/>
<br/>
You're now tuned into the motherfucking greatest<br/>
<br/>
Best rapper alive, best rapper alive
