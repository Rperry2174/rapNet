<i>[Chorus Usher &amp; Pharrell]</i><br/>
<br/>
Anything you want girl<br/>
I'll bet you never seen it like this<br/>
Just stay up on that floor girl<br/>
And I'll grant all your wishes<br/>
You know, you know, you know,<br/>
You know, you know, you know,<br/>
You hot<br/>
Especially when you bounce, bounce<br/>
I really like it when you bounce, bounce<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ooh you so nasty<br/>
Amateur pole dancing<br/>
Come and get this cash from me<br/>
They call me rain man<br/>
She tried to rain dance<br/>
Money so long it will drown you girl<br/>
Buried under so much stacks<br/>
They had to pull back about 50 thou<br/>
Before they found ya girl<br/>
I brought book bags of that bankroll<br/>
I'm a D boy baby they know<br/>
I'm an original D boy<br/>
They go bankrupt if they try to keep up<br/>
No roof in my car but I got mirrors on the ceiling<br/>
I'll spread bread on the bed<br/>
Ever had sex on a million<br/>
Tell me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
<br/>
Red light, TLC<br/>
Through the left eye<br/>
My POV<br/>
On the eye chat<br/>
How's that for computer love<br/>
She rolled her eyes back<br/>
I'm like ooh you're so nasty<br/>
You turned my Maybach back seat<br/>
Into the Hotel De'Paris<br/>
I ain't gotta go<br/>
Down to the go-go<br/>
You got a private show that's like magic city<br/>
I got stacks of fifties<br/>
I got piles of hundreds<br/>
That's role play<br/>
Act like you want it<br/>
You know you know you hot like fire<br/>
You throw that body<br/>
I'll throw them dollars<br/>
But not them 1's and not no 5's<br/>
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland?<br/>
That's a thousand dollars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
<br/>
Girl<br/>
You know<br/>
You hot like fire<br/>
As I blow some dough<br/>
You might retire<br/>
Take it slow like Ne-Yo<br/>
When shots was fired<br/>
In the Matrix have patience<br/>
Got lots of bottles<br/>
Rock-a-bye baby JAY-Z got notes like Mariah<br/>
Got no 1's got no 5's<br/>
My D notes are higher<br/>
I'm a D boy, they decoys<br/>
They money is lighter<br/>
Like Nicole Richie<br/>
Roll with me<br/>
They on the diet baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
