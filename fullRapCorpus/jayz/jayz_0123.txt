<i>[unknown singing]</i><br/>
That old fashioned word.. it's a word called LOVE!<br/>
Called looooove, called looo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-ove<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Oh!  This must be the way the nigga 'Pac felt when he made<br/>
"Me Against the World," "All Eyez on Me"<br/>
Y'all niggaz got me feelin like all eyes on me, me against the world<br/>
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit<br/>
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I did to this game<br/>
Bein that, I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood<br/>
Come from the same hood you come from<br/>
We share basically the same stories<br/>
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I came and did<br/>
since ninety-six, every year<br/>
Somethin must be seriously wrong with the world<br/>
I know y'all ain't hatin<br/>
<br/>
(Some people hate!) Don't tell me niggaz is hatin<br/>
(Some people hate!) Nah.. you know what I think?<br/>
(Some people hate!) I think..<br/>
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind<br/>
Y'all got me on my shit<br/>
<br/>
Raw rough and rugged, when addressin the mass public<br/>
My attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it<br/>
Got a, chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas<br/>
And fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters<br/>
I came from the gutter, my success in this game<br/>
is sort of like "Pro-jectic Justice," a payment for brushes<br/>
with police officers, a peace offering<br/>
From the Gods for the streets I was tossed in<br/>
'Til I'm deceased in a coffin<br/>
I'ma be a beast on these beats, releasin early and often<br/>
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon' change the numbers<br/>
It's the strengthenin of chain among us<br/>
Please, we ain't afraid of none of yas, who want it with us?<br/>
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summers, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
(Some people hate!) Jeah, uh, yeah<br/>
(Some people hate!) Uh, uhh, uhh<br/>
(Some people hate!) Yeah.. you know what I think?<br/>
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's just the penalty of leadership<br/>
I guess I'm what niggaz wanna be and shit<br/>
Or niggaz just bored, wanna be in shit<br/>
'Fore they get to rappin, start believin it<br/>
Think they Ali and shit<br/>
I roll with the punches so I survive<br/>
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side<br/>
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise surprise<br/>
They try to take me out the game, but I's alive<br/>
It's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey<br/>
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga<br/>
You bastards know me, the one and only<br/>
Big homey from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely<br/>
You need Jesus in your life.. it's either that<br/>
or y'all gon' make me put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga!<br/>
<br/>
(Some people hate!) I know niggaz are hatin man, let me find out<br/>
(Some people hate!)<br/>
Jealousy's a weak emotion, y'all gotta overcome that man<br/>
(Some people kill their brothers)<br/>
C'mon man be stronger than that.. you know what I think?<br/>
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be aight though<br/>
<br/>
Au contraire nigga, I am here cause I earned the shit<br/>
By ridin out, when niggaz had learner's permit<br/>
We bring the knives out, or we let them burners spit<br/>
I bring them pies out if niggaz wanna burn the strip<br/>
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out, turn your 6<br/>
I laid back in the Maybach<br/>
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggaz from way back<br/>
Niggaz wanna clown but the pound it don't play dat<br/>
Get yourself found, drowned, where the lake at<br/>
Run up on 'em +Notoriously+, "Take that!" (take that)<br/>
And then we comin where your wake at<br/>
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that<br/>
Face facts, fake rap cats<br/>
can't take back what I took back to the Brook', look<br/>
<br/>
(Some people hate!)<br/>
(Some people hate!)<br/>
(Some people kill their brothers)<br/>
(I think they've lost their minds)<br/>
(And I'm hung up.. ohh..)
