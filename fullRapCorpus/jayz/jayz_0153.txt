<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Make up, and break up<br/>
That's all we do<br/>
Then we have sex, next thing you know<br/>
Everything is cool<br/>
Best of Both Worlds!  Holla at your boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Like we always do about this time<br/>
Uh-huh, yeah<br/>
I know what you doin ma<br/>
Tryin to get in an argument with me so I can<br/>
do my mad thing, you want me to do my mad thing<br/>
I understand - c'mon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Seems we're always arguing, but<br/>
Right after the arguing we have, sex<br/>
And somehow it's the best, yes<br/>
Seems we're always arguing, but<br/>
Right after the arguing we have, sex<br/>
And somehow it's the best girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[first instance of Chorus - no last line]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jigga overlaps first instance of Chorus]</i><br/>
Gangsta love, gangsta love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Think about it while the streets you roam<br/>
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home<br/>
Sex is always better fresh off a vendetta<br/>
We break up or break you off then we right back together<br/>
Then this brand new leathers and Caroline Aurera<br/>
Marijuana, white wine, somewhere under the weather<br/>
Like we sick but we fine, shit we couldn't feel better<br/>
Just some sunshine in mind lookin fine as ever<br/>
who got a mouth on her, woo, she put some words together<br/>
Sometimes'll make a nigga wanna leave, but when we make up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z over Chorus]</i><br/>
Woo!<br/>
Boy talk boy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Break up to make up baby<br/>
Seems that's all we do darlin<br/>
But no one wants to walk out the door<br/>
After all of the holla'n<br/>
Cursing and fighting<br/>
And me sleeping on the couch<br/>
In the midst of our stormy weather<br/>
Sex brings the sun out<br/>
After I hit that there<br/>
Seems we don't have a care<br/>
Sex makes you say I'm sorry<br/>
And things like I'm not goin nowhere<br/>
It's somethin bout the P-U-S-S-Y<br/>
That keeps brother in check, even I<br/>
Even if you was a pimp you couldn't survive<br/>
Without the H-E-L-P to provide you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[third instance of Chorus - no last line]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Think about it while the streets you roam<br/>
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home<br/>
Remember that night?  You was all like<br/>
Maybe we should go our seperate ways for life<br/>
I hit the lights fit you tight at the lil' place right<br/>
I hit it right you look me right in the eyes like psych<br/>
You was goin through your act 'til I caught you in the sack<br/>
And I made you relax when I (hit it hard from the back)<br/>
Yeah now we back friends<br/>
And the next time you need some sex counselin, we<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - new last line "after we get through arguin we"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Seems we're always arguing, but<br/>
Right after the arguing we have, sex<br/>
Sex with best friends<br/>
From the bathroom to the kitchen (we sex)<br/>
From the kitchen to living room (we sex)<br/>
From the living room to upstairs (we sex)<br/>
Upstairs to the attic (we sex)<br/>
Attic to the basement (we sex)<br/>
From the basement to the car garage (we sex)<br/>
Garage to the back of the Jeep (we sex)<br/>
Bicycle to the treadmill (we sex)<br/>
Even over by the dirty lawnmower (we sex)<br/>
The neighbors and the dogs are lookin crazy (we sex)<br/>
I don't care because you're my baby (we sex)<br/>
It's our house, and we can have sex (we sex)<br/>
anytime we want to (we sex)<br/>
They can kiss my ass, because whoa-ho-hoo<br/>
Hey L Don you feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[L Don]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah yeah I feel you<br/>
You and Jay crazy man, but it's all good<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br/>
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la<br/>
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la - sex<br/>
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la<br/>
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la - sex
