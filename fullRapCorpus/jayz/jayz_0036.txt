<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah<br/>
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown<br/>
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i> Cocaine whiter now<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Operation is sweet<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i> Whole game tighter now<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> Movin a brick a week<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i> Plus a nigga price is down<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> We them niggaz to see<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i> Time to start the arisin now<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i> I don't know what's wrong with Bleek<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It seems, I'm like Keenan, pickin up on the vibe<br/>
that he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes<br/>
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividin the loot<br/>
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute<br/>
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car<br/>
Matchin the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors<br/>
These young niggaz think I fell out the loop<br/>
cause the last time they seen me hoppin, out the Coupe<br/>
I hopped out in a suit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Look at this nigga Jay frontin tryin to take my shine<br/>
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind<br/>
Plus I'm puffin like an ounce, more than I used to puff<br/>
Takin advice from these niggaz but they ain't used to stuff<br/>
They had me thinkin, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff<br/>
while he drive around town in brand new Coupe's and stufF"<br/>
Swear to God, they had me practically hatin his guts<br/>
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga whattup?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
I done came up (uhh) put my life on the line (uhh)<br/>
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's my time to shine<br/>
Time to change up (what?) no more second in line<br/>
Nine-eight, these streets is mine <br/>
(uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breakin my heart<br/>
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart<br/>
I felt his hatred it was harsh, 'fore this fakin shit start<br/>
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe<br/>
and had I, not been so high I woulda been able to hide<br/>
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five<br/>
Hugged him, as if I loved him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
To the naked eye<br/>
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us<br/>
could see that somethin was about to go down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Stay focused<br/>
I'm tryin to concentrate, but it's like he's reading my mind<br/>
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind<br/>
Could he see I had plans on, bein the man<br/>
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand<br/>
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause<br/>
As he approached ("Whattup Bleek?") and I paused..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Memphis Bleek, Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I done came up (uhh) put my life on the line (uhh)<br/>
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's my time to shine<br/>
Time to change up (what?) no more second in line<br/>
Nine-eight, these streets is mine <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you done came up (uhh) put your life on the line (uhh)<br/>
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's yo' time to shine<br/>
Time to change up, no more second in line<br/>
<i>[Bleek]</i> Nine-eight, these streets is mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters<br/>
Mouthed off at the cops, I done crammed every drop<br/>
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers<br/>
with different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us<br/>
So til death do us, I'm never breakin my bond<br/>
Nigga we Lex movers, V-12 pushers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
As I stand<br/>
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "Man what?"<br/>
I know these niggaz are peepin my mind cancer<br/>
But in time's the answer<br/>
Seems mind-blowin, this weed and Hennesey<br/>
Got my mind goin, trust me nigga, I'm knowin<br/>
Chicks used to ignore me, and my aunt sayin I need fifty<br/>
not sixty-forty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Oh God, don't let him control y'all<br/>
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Your fun is my fun (uh-huh) your bitch is my bitch<br/>
Any nigga tryin to harm Jay I'm feelin for you<br/>
I ain't only touchin you, I'm killin your crew<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Give it a year, you'll be sittin on a million or two<br/>
records sold nigga, perfect your roll, geyeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
I done came up (came up) put my life on the line<br/>
Soaked the game up (game up) now it's my time to shine<br/>
Time to change up (change up) no more second in line<br/>
Nine-eight, these streets is mine (what, geyeah geyeah)<br/>
<br/>
I done came up (came up) put my life on the line<br/>
Soaked the game up (game up) now it's my time to shine<br/>
Time to change up (change up) no more second in line<br/>
Nine-eight, these streets is mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, you done came up (uhh) put your life on the line (uhh)<br/>
Soaked the game up (yeah) now it's yo' time to shine<br/>
Time to change up, no more second in line<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Coming of Age Two, brand new
