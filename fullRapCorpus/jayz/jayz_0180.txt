<i>[Chorus - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Hello Brooklyn how you doing? where you going? can I come too<br/>
And if I can I'm a be your man you could be my lady<br/>
And have my baby and drive my cars and drive me crazy<br/>
Wherever you going baby girl just take me 'cause I'm so taken<br/>
If you taken I'm just sayin' baby I'm just sayin'<br/>
