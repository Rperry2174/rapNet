<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I got myself a gun<br/>
Brooklyn, stand up<br/>
I got myself a gun<br/>
But really, I dont need tha heat<br/>
Ya heart pump project kool-aid(ya sweet)<br/>
I aint gotta two-way you gays<br/>
This is not beef<br/>
This is rap hommie<br/>
I dont have a scratch on me<br/>
You feel Jay soft<br/>
Rip jay off<br/>
Damn I'm only worth over a hundred million<br/>
Look<br/>
I got beef with like a hundred children<br/>
Niggaz with pink suits<br/>
Tryin to get cute<br/>
You a little outta line hommie<br/>
Dont let the 9 hommie<br/>
Put ya out ya mind hommie<br/>
Bitch keep tryin hommie<br/>
Kick yo little lies<br/>
I kick my real facts<br/>
Like u sneakin out tha back<br/>
At tha Source Soundlab(uh)<br/>
We wasnt chasin you<br/>
We had a tape and too<br/>
We came through to do our little one, two thang<br/>
It wasnt a rockafella come through thing<br/>
If it was on like that<br/>
Why would I come through Queens<br/>
Yo, ya'll Queens nigga know how I do<br/>
I got mo' shooters in Queens Bridge than u<br/>
Niggaz'll(niggaz will) tie you up on the Colloseum roof<br/>
And open beer bottles off ya boy's chipped tooth<br/>
Look Here,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got myself a gun,Uh Ohhhh!<br/>
Yea, I got myself a gun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Listen<br/>
I'm tha J, tha A, to the fuck this broad<br/>
This nigga never sold asprin<br/>
How u escobar?<br/>
Had to buy you're chain back tha last time u got robbed<br/>
The nerve of this coward nigga....(Oh My God)<br/>
And all rap rumors are induendo<br/>
I bring them to you live<br/>
Lift up ya window<br/>
Let tha public begin to see your dirty laundry<br/>
Ya'll dont want me to continue(Oh!)<br/>
Super Ugly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z Laughing]</i><br/>
<i>[Nas Voice:]</i><br/>
I dont give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
All I really know is that yo hoe wants to be with me<br/>
She aint playin<br/>
Believe what I'm sayin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Me and tha boy A.I. got more in Common than just ballin and rhymin<br/>
Get It?<br/>
More in Carmen<br/>
I came in ya Bentley backseat<br/>
Skeeted in Jeep<br/>
Left condoms in tha baby seat<br/>
Here nigga<br/>
Tha gloves is off<br/>
The love is done<br/>
Its whateva, wheneva, howeva<br/>
Nigga "1"<br/>
And since you infatuated with sayin tha gay shit<br/>
Yes u was kissin my dick when u was kissin that bitch<br/>
Crazy bitch<br/>
You thought I was boning Ranette<br/>
You calling Carm' a hundred times I was boning her neck<br/>
You got a baby by that broad<br/>
You cant disown her yet<br/>
When does ya lies end?<br/>
When does the truth begin?<br/>
When does reality set it?<br/>
Or does it not matter<br/>
Gotta hurt that I'm ya baby mama's favorite rapper<br/>
And ask your current girl<br/>
She know whats up<br/>
Holla at a real nigga<br/>
<i>[Nas Voice:]</i><br/>
I dont give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
All I really know is that yo hoe wants to be with me<br/>
She aint playin<br/>
Believe what I'm sayin
