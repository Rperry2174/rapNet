Sorry boys..<br/>
but all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again<br/>
Lay down, lay down<br/>
Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy<br/>
All those new niggaz stop there<br/>
but a lot later than a whole gang of people thought<br/>
The last of the real hustlers, well<br/>
maybe not the last<br/>
Bleek's gonna be a good rapper<br/>
New, IMPROVED Jay-Z<br/>
I quit<br/>
I'm retirin<br/>
Ain't enough money in THIS game, to keep me around<br/>
Sorry Big, I tried<br/>
Honest<br/>
Can't go with me on this ride though<br/>
I'm callin the shots<br/>
The bar's closing<br/>
Where we going to for breakfast?<br/>
Roc-a-Fella y'all<br/>
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!<br/>
<br/>
"Bringin the drama" <br/>
"Tryin to come up in the game"<br/>
"Marcy"<br/>
"Had a couple of dollar signs to my name"<br/>
"Roc-a-Fella y'all"<br/>
"One of the best!"<br/>
"Waitin for my day to come"<br/>
"Just give me the word"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Nah this ain't Jigga it's your lil nigga Bleek<br/>
Reportin to these motherfuckers live from the street<br/>
Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced<br/>
At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes<br/>
Peep the steez, I represent for all those<br/>
with 28 grams, on a come-up tryin to creep the keys<br/>
Large niggaz told me park the car, keep the keys<br/>
Find a hoodrat and creep to Mickey D's<br/>
First gun two bullets, niggaz know I do pull it<br/>
Niggaz tryin to kill me dog, who wouldn't?<br/>
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJ's<br/>
Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger<br/>
You find a bitch that don't be cream, bring her<br/>
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us<br/>
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the<br/>
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense who wants it?<br/>
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall<br/>
Man I'm tryin to come up on y'all<br/>
Get one up on y'all, that's why I hustle in these streets<br/>
from sundown to sunup on y'all<br/>
Mama said keep bullshittin they'll kill you dead<br/>
One week of this hustlin brought a living room set<br/>
Went to ? D's, niggaz mad, veins out<br/>
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out<br/>
Flashy, fly little nigga<br/>
Nosy bitch from the third floor like "Why little nigga?"<br/>
Bitch please, twist the trees<br/>
Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe<br/>
That's my answer, life's like cancer<br/>
And I'm serious<br/>
<br/>
"Waitin for my day to come"<br/>
"Just give me the word"
