Uhh, just point out the bounce<br/>
Uh-huh, show me the bounce, yeah<br/>
Just point out the bounce, yeah<br/>
Timbo the king, yeah<br/>
Young Hov' the king, yeah<br/>
Just point out the bounce..<br/>
Yes, just point out the bounce nigga<br/>
Yo, listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Rumor has it "The Blueprint" classic<br/>
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden<br/>
So September 11th marks the era forever<br/>
of a revolutionary Che Gueverra<br/>
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov' MCers<br/>
Everybody dupin the flow, you see 'em<br/>
Everybody loopin up soul<br/>
It's like you tryin to make "The Blueprint 2" before Hov'<br/>
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy<br/>
See how we adjusted the game so easy<br/>
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get<br/>
Like - oh shit, he's so handsome<br/>
Still in demand in the longest run standin<br/>
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom<br/>
Can't one nigga get it back no rap<br/>
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Point out the bounce - and show you how to get this dough in<br/>
large amounts 'til it's hard to count<br/>
Point out the bounce - I turn a 8 to an ounce<br/>
to a whole ki to the R.O.C.<br/>
Point out the bounce - Timbo the king nigga<br/>
Uhh, yeah, uhh<br/>
Point out the bounce - jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, I got y'all..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n<br/>
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know english<br/>
They only know what the single is, and singled that out<br/>
to be the meaning of what he is about<br/>
And bein I'm about my business, not minglin much<br/>
runnin my mouth, that shit kept lingerin<br/>
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinklin<br/>
The album width to keep the registers ringin<br/>
In real life, I'm much more distinguished<br/>
I'm like a bloke from London, England<br/>
Jeah, you jinglin baby<br/>
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby<br/>
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul<br/>
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row<br/>
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good<br/>
Slangin them O's like a real O.G. should<br/>
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out he's so young<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Magazines call me a rock star, girls call me cock star<br/>
Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star<br/>
Chi-Town go-gettin pimps, we mobsters<br/>
Gingerbread Man even said, "You're a monster!"<br/>
Yeah, that's how I feel<br/>
To be down, you must appeal<br/>
To the crew, we're rated R<br/>
O.C., O.G., Bobby Johnson son<br/>
Ask me, "Rey-Rey, is that yo' car?"<br/>
I seen MTV, I know who you are<br/>
You did "Takeover," do you got beef with Nas?<br/>
I did take over the game, brought back the soul<br/>
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold<br/>
Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow<br/>
All I, know, I gots the flow<br/>
And I don't play cause I'm from Chicago<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Point out the bounce <i>[repeat 5X]</i>
