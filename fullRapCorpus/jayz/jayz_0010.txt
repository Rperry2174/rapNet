<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah...<br/>
Come experience... life as we know it<br/>
As some of you should know it, yeah, yeah<br/>
Place, Marcy, Brooklyn<br/>
Actions... well, y'all know the actions<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clockin my rocks<br/>
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock<br/>
He likes the way I walk, he sees my money talkin<br/>
to honies hawkin I'm the hottest nigga in New York and<br/>
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils<br/>
He wanna, run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal<br/>
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear<br/>
then it's just enough for re-up again<br/>
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's<br/>
to Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace<br/>
That's just the natural cycle, nobody wanna be like Michael<br/>
where I'm from, just them niggaz who banned from a gun<br/>
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green<br/>
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen<br/>
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone<br/>
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)<br/>
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)<br/>
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)<br/>
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
I'm out here slingin bringin the drama, tryin to come up<br/>
in the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name<br/>
I'm out here servin disturbin the peace, life could be better<br/>
like my man reclined in plush leather seats<br/>
He's sellin weight, I'm sellin eight... balls<br/>
sixteen tryin to graduate to pushin quarters y'all<br/>
I ain't gon' sweat him I'ma let him come to me<br/>
If he give me the nod then these niggaz gon' see<br/>
I'm tired of bein out here round the clock<br/>
and breakin day, and chasin crackers up the block for my pay<br/>
I'm stayin fresh, so chickens check<br/>
I'm tryin to step up to the next level, pushin Vettes to the Jets<br/>
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibirum<br/>
and stunned I'm waitin for my day to come<br/>
I got the urge, to splurge, I don't wanna lifetime sentence<br/>
just give me the word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Hey fella I been watchin you clockin<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> Who me holdin down this block it ain't nothin<br/>
You the man nigga now stop frontin<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Hahahh I like your style<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> Nah, I like YO' style<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Let's drive around awhile<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> Cool nigga<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Here's a thou'<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> A G? I ride witchu for free<br/>
I want the longterm riches and bitches<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Have it all; now listen to me<br/>
You let them other niggaz get the name, skip the fame<br/>
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep yo' shit the same<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> On the low?<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Yeah, the only way to blow<br/>
You let your shit bubble quietly<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> AND THEN YOU BLOW!<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Hey keep your cool<br/>
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand<br/>
Then you play your cards<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> Then he through dealin I understand<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Don't blow your dough on hotties<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts<br/>
and won't break em for nobody!<br/>
<i>[JZ]</i> Hah, I like resume, pick a day, you can start<br/>
<i>[MB]</i> From now until death do us part...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
