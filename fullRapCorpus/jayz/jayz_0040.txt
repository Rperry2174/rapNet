<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, un huh, watch this y'all, come on,watch this y'all, Jigga<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Kid Capri]</i><br/>
It's Kid Capri and Jay-Z, It's Kid Capri and Jay-Z<br/>
Cause I'm Like That yo ! Cause I'm like that yo !<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
As a young and dumb man, gun in the waist<br/>
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain<br/>
And had to numb it with baste<br/>
Couldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin to chase<br/>
I needed something to chase<br/>
Nowadays I throw shots back,leavin nothin to waste<br/>
Life is like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place<br/>
Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past<br/>
&gt; I vowed to never stop winnin, 'til the earth stop spinnin<br/>
Rock hot lenin, cop hot cars and hot women<br/>
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not remembering,<br/>
My motto is simply I will not lose, abide by the block rules,<br/>
I buy my glock used, wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it ?<br/>
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood,<br/>
If you ain't live like I live then run with the hood<br/>
I done what i could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still<br/>
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature, if hell awaits ya ?<br/>
Nigga I'm coming with the razors, still flashin ya shit<br/>
Try to pass me in a six, tight classy on the wrist<br/>
Every bit of 30 karats, this is not a game<br/>
This isn't why I came, make these words find a spot on your brain<br/>
And burn, then I recycle my life<br/>
I shall return<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Female voice and Jay- Z]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Woman]</i><br/>
How tight is your flow ?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Cause I'm like that yo !<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Woman]</i><br/>
How right is your dough ?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Cause I'm like that yo !<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Woman]</i><br/>
How white is your blow ?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Cause I'm like that yo !<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Woman]</i><br/>
Only writers you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Cause I'm like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I'm a hop, skip, a jump, from rippin the pump<br/>
Spittin a couple of curse words, and hittin you chump<br/>
Shit, I get digits in lumps, I'm a motherfucking problem is this what you want<br/>
?<br/>
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff chiva,<br/>
And reefer paper, I hate the one's that blow up ya beeper<br/>
Cause I, go in ya deeper, I only bone divas<br/>
Inpregnate the world when I "cum" through your speakers (ha ha)<br/>
Fuck hot my records got the fever<br/>
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up<br/>
I creep up when the beef heats up, caught him with his feet up<br/>
And shoes off, bout to snooze off<br/>
Hatin, cause you can't turn the booze off<br/>
You dudes is too soft, when I fuck with you all<br/>
I might bark your ex, and spit at the locks<br/>
But, other than that I ain't even fucking with cats<br/>
Just me tied B.I., thug it like that, me,dame and biggs<br/>
What's fuckin with that ?<br/>
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothing for that<br/>
Other then a couple slugs in ya back,<i>[huh huh]</i><br/>
Rappers y'all runnin around, like I won't gun ya down<br/>
Last nigga that fronted, two spun him around<br/>
Lord, except this offer here's somethin for your crown<br/>
I admit no malice, I just met his challenge, In one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Repeat 3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z: Repeat 2x til fade]</i><br/>
<br/>
Girls and guns, all i want<br/>
stock exchange, rocks and thangs
