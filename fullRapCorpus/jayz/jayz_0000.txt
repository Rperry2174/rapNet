I'm making short term goals, wonder whether foes<br/>
just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold<br/>
chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willy<br/>
high stakes, I got more at stake than Philly<br/>
shopping sprees, coping three, deuce fever I guess its fully loaded,<br/>
ah yes,<br/>
bouncing in the lex luger, tires smoke like Buddha<br/>
50 g's to the crap shooter,<br/>
niggas can't fade me<br/>
chrome socks beaming, through my peripheral I see ya scheming<br/>
stop dreamin', I leave ya body steaming<br/>
niggas is feening, what's the meaning<br/>
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening with the sound of my money machine-in<br/>
my cuff running over with hundreds<br/>
I'm one of the best niggas that done it<br/>
six digits and running,<br/>
y'all niggas don't want it<br/>
I got the godfather flow, the don Juan Demarco<br/>
swear to god, don't get it fucked up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
taking out this time<br/>
to give you a piece of my mind<br/>
(cause you can't knock the hustle)<br/>
but though you think you are<br/>
baby one day you'll be a star<br/>
<br/>
last seen out of state where I drop my slang<br/>
I'm deep in the south kicking up top game<br/>
bouncing on the highway switching 4 lanes<br/>
screaming through the sun roof money ain't a thang<br/>
your worst fear confirmed,<br/>
me and my fam roll tight like the firm<br/>
getting down for life, that's right, you better learn<br/>
why play with fire, burn<br/>
we get together like a choir<br/>
to acquire what we desire<br/>
we do dirt like worms<br/>
produce g's like sperm<br/>
'til legs spread like germs<br/>
I got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes<br/>
and I sip wine, and spit vintage flows<br/>
but y'all don't know......<br/>
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,<br/>
cause you can't knock the hustle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
but until that day then<br/>
I'm the one whose crazy<br/>
cause that's the way ya making me feel<br/>
(cause you can't knock the hustle)<br/>
I'm just trying to get mine,<br/>
I don't have the time<br/>
to knock the hustle for real<br/>
<br/>
y'all niggas lunching, punching a clock<br/>
my function is lo make much 'n' lay back munching<br/>
sipping Remy on rocks, my crew<br/>
something to watch nothing to stop<br/>
un...<br/>
...stoppable<br/>
scheme on the ice, I gotta hide your crew<br/>
I gotta<br/>
let you niggas know the time like movado<br/>
my motto,<br/>
stack rocks like Colorado<br/>
bottle off the champagne, crystals by the bottle<br/>
it's a damn shame what you're not though (who?) me slick like a GATO fuckin' Jay-Z<br/>
pops knew exactly what he did when he made me<br/>
tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what<br/>
straight banana's<br/>
can a nigga, see me<br/>
got the US Open, advantage jigga<br/>
serve like sampras, play fake a rappers like a campus Le Tigre,<br/>
son you're too eager<br/>
you ain't having it? good, me either<br/>
lets get together and make this whole world believers<br/>
at my arraignment, screaming<br/>
all these blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even<br/>
thieving, as long as I'm breathing<br/>
can't knock the way a nigga eating<br/>
fuck you even<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
taking out this time<br/>
to give you a piece of my mind<br/>
but though you think you are<br/>
baby one day you'll be a star<br/>
but until that day then<br/>
I'm the one whose crazy<br/>
cause that's the way ya making me feel,<br/>
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time<br/>
to knock the hustle for real
