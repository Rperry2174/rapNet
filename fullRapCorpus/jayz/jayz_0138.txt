(Woooooo)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
(Turn the music up turn the lights down I'm in my zone)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity<br/>
This moment of honesty<br/>
The world'll feel my truths<br/>
Through my Hard Knock Life time<br/>
My Gift and The Curse<br/>
I gave you volume after volume of my work<br/>
So you can feel my truths<br/>
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out<br/>
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt<br/>
(You all can't fill my shoes)<br/>
From my Blueprint beginnings<br/>
To that Black Album ending<br/>
Listen close you hear what I'm about<br/>
Nigga feel my truths<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
When Pop died<br/>
Didn't cry<br/>
Didn't know him that well<br/>
Between him doing Heroine<br/>
And me doing Crack sales<br/>
With that in the egg shell<br/>
Standing at the tabernacle<br/>
Rather the church<br/>
Pretending to be hurt<br/>
Wouldn't work<br/>
So a smirk was all on my face<br/>
Like damn that mans face was just like my face<br/>
So pop I forgive you<br/>
For all the shit that I live through<br/>
It wasn't all your fault<br/>
Homie you got caught<br/>
And to the same game I fault<br/>
That Uncle Ray lost<br/>
My big brothers and so many others I saw<br/>
I'm just glad we got to see each other<br/>
Talk and re-meet each other<br/>
Save a place in Heaven<br/>
'til the next time we meet forever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
The music business hate me<br/>
'cause the industry ain't make me<br/>
Hustlers and boosters embrace me<br/>
And the music I be making<br/>
I dumb down for my audience<br/>
And double my dollars<br/>
They criticize me for it<br/>
Yet they all yell "Holla"<br/>
If skills sold<br/>
Truth be told<br/>
I'd probably be<br/>
Lyrically<br/>
Talib Kweli<br/>
Truthfully<br/>
I wanna rhyme like Common Sense<br/>
(But I did five Mil)<br/>
I ain't been rhyming like Common since<br/>
When your sense got that much in common<br/>
And you been hosteling since<br/>
Your inception<br/>
Fuck perception<br/>
Go with what makes sense<br/>
Since<br/>
I know what I'm up against<br/>
We as rappers must decide what's most important<br/>
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them<br/>
So I got rich and gave back<br/>
To me that's the win, win<br/>
The next time you see the homie and his rims spin<br/>
Just know my mind is working just like them<br/>
(The rims that is)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
My homie Sigel's on a tier<br/>
Where no tears should fall<br/>
'cause he was on the block where no squares get off<br/>
See in my inner circle all we do is ball<br/>
Til we all got triangles on our wall<br/>
He ain't just rappin for the platinum<br/>
You all record<br/>
I recall<br/>
'cause I really been there before<br/>
Four scores and seven years ago<br/>
Prepared to flow<br/>
Prepare for war<br/>
I shall fear no man<br/>
You don't hear me though<br/>
These words ain't just paired to go<br/>
In one ear out the other ear<br/>
NO<br/>
YO<br/>
My balls and my word is all I have<br/>
What you gonna do to me?<br/>
Nigga scars'll scab<br/>
What you gonna box me homie?<br/>
I can dodge and jab<br/>
Three shots couldn't touch me<br/>
Thank God for that<br/>
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back<br/>
And the whole BK nigga holla back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
