Welcome to the Future,<br/>
Blue Print 3<br/>
Ay count me in<br/>
Find me a nice soft place to land<br/>
I'm so high<br/>
Find me a place to land,<br/>
Yeah right there,<br/>
<br/>
I'm so tomorrow,<br/>
The Audemars are yesterday,<br/>
Which means your on time delay,<br/>
So even if I slow it doooown,<br/>
My sound is fast forward, hold up<br/>
I'm just a runway show<br/>
But I wear this on my plane in my runway clothes,<br/>
Cashmere sweats they come out next year<br/>
But these my last year sweats,<br/>
And my hoe so sick, your new chick cant f-ck with my old b-tch,<br/>
And you know this sh-t,<br/>
I'm professional, they know this is,<br/>
I just may let you borrow this,<br/>
This the blueprint n-gga follow this,<br/>
This what what tomorrow is,<br/>
Welcome to tomorrow b–tch,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
Whatever you about to discover we off that<br/>
You about to tell her you love her we off that,<br/>
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that,<br/>
But you can’t bring the future back,<br/>
Ya'll steady chasing the fame we off that,<br/>
Oversized clothes and chains we off that,<br/>
N-gga still making it rain and we off that,<br/>
Cos you can’t bring the future back,<br/>
Tell n-ggas top get off me,<br/>
Cris we off that,<br/>
Timbs we off that,<br/>
Rims we off that,<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah We off that is you still on that,<br/>
If you still making money cos we still on that,<br/>
<br/>
This ain’t black versus white my n-gga we off that,<br/>
Please tell Bill O Reilly to fall back,<br/>
Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls,<br/>
Its 2010 not 1864 ,<br/>
Ah yeh we come so far,<br/>
So I drive around town hard top and its off<br/>
Ah and my tribeca loft with my high brow art<br/>
And my high yellow broad<br/>
Ah and my dark skin sis and my best white mate<br/>
Say whats up to to chris,<br/>
Ah, hows that for a mix,<br/>
Got a black president,<br/>
Got green presidents,<br/>
Blueprints in my white ipod,<br/>
Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, My God,<br/>
Ah we aint tripping off that,<br/>
Its a benetton ad, n-gga been up off that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I dont give a fidduuck, abiddout the widday,<br/>
You used to move, what you used to do,<br/>
And I dont give a fidduuck abiddout the b-tches<br/>
That you used to screw<br/>
What your future do,<br/>
And we don’t really care what you used to say,<br/>
Unless that affects your future pay,<br/>
Im on the practice field running two a day,<br/>
So I don’t drop the ball when its threw my way,<br/>
So I don’t a fidduck abiddout the sh-t that<br/>
You probably did,<br/>
Who you probably is,<br/>
The only time I deal in past tense<br/>
Is i’m past rims,<br/>
And i’m past tints,<br/>
If you driving it I drove it,<br/>
You got it cos I sold it,<br/>
You copped it and I bought it back,<br/>
And we don’t give a fidduck n-gga we off that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
