The takeover, the break's over nigga<br/>
God MC, me, Jay-Hova<br/>
Hey lil' soldier you ain't ready for war<br/>
R.O.C. too strong for y'all<br/>
It's like bringin a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test<br/>
Your chest in the line of fire witcha thin-ass vest<br/>
You bringin them Boyz II Men, HOW them boys gon' win?<br/>
This is grown man B.I., get you rolled in the triage(?)<br/>
Beatch - your reach ain't long enough, dunny<br/>
Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucka<br/>
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy<br/>
Niggaz'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady<br/>
We bring - knife to fistfight, kill your drama<br/>
Uh, we kill you motherfuckin ants with a sledgehammer<br/>
Don't let me do it to you dunny cause I overdo it<br/>
So you won't confuse it with just rap music<br/>
<br/>
R.O.C., we runnin this rap shit<br/>
M-Easy, we runnin this rap shit<br/>
The Broad Street Bully, we runnin this rap shit<br/>

O &amp; Sparks, we runnin this rap shit<br/>
Chris &amp; Neef, we runnin this rap shit<br/>
"Watch out!! We run New York" -&gt; <i>[KRS-One]</i><br/>
<br/>
I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews<br/>
You little FUCK, I've got money stacks bigger than you<br/>
When I was pushin weight, back in eighty-eight<br/>
you was a ballerina I got your pictures I seen ya<br/>
Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switch your demeanor<br/>
Well - we don't believe you, you need more people<br/>
Roc-A-Fella, students of the game, we passed the classes<br/>
Nobody could read you dudes like we do<br/>
Don't let 'em gas you like Jigga is ass and won't clap you<br/>
Trust me on this one - I'll detach you<br/>
Mind from spirit, body from soul<br/>
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole<br/>
No, you're not on my level get your brakes tweaked<br/>
I sold what ya whole album sold in my first week<br/>
You guys don't want it with Hov'<br/>
Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov', nooooo!<br/>
<br/>
R.O.C., we runnin this rap shit<br/>
B. Sigel, we runnin this rap shit<br/>
M-Easy, we runnin this rap shit<br/>
Get zipped up in plastic when it happens that's it<br/>

"Watch out!! We run New York" -&gt; <i>[KRS-One]</i><br/>
<br/>
I know you missin all the - FAAAAAAAME!<br/>
But along with celebrity comes bout seventy shots to your brain<br/>
Nigga; you a - LAAAAAAAME!<br/>
Youse the fag model for Karl Kani/Esco ads<br/>
Went from, Nasty Nas to Esco's trash<br/>
Had a spark when you started but now you're just garbage<br/>
Fell from top ten to not mentioned at all<br/>
to your bodyguard's "Oochie Wally" verse better than yours<br/>
Matter fact you had the worst flow on the whole fuckin song<br/>
but I know - the sun don't shine, then son don't shine<br/>
That's why your - LAAAAAAAME! - career come to a end<br/>
There's only so long fake thugs can pretend<br/>
Nigga; you ain't live it you witnessed it from your folks pad<br/>
You scribbled in your notepad and created your life<br/>
I showed you your first tec on tour with Large Professor<br/>
(Me, that's who!) Then I heard your album bout your tec on your dresser<br/>
So yeah I sampled your voice, you was usin it wrong<br/>
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song<br/>
And you ain't get a corn nigga you was gettin fucked and<br/>
I know who I paid God, Serchlite Publishing<br/>
Use your - BRAAAAAAAIN!  You said you been in this ten<br/>
I've been in it five - smarten up Nas<br/>
Four albums in ten years nigga?  I could divide<br/>
That's one every let's say two, two of them shits was due<br/>
One was - NAHHH, the other was "Illmatic"<br/>
That's a one hot album every ten year average<br/>
And that's so - LAAAAAAAME!  Nigga switch up your flow<br/>
Your shit is garbage, but you try and kick knowledge?<br/>
(Get the fuck outta here) You niggaz gon' learn to respect the king<br/>
Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen<br/>
Because you know who (who) did you know what (what)<br/>
with you know who (yeah) but just keep that between me and you for now<br/>
<br/>
R.O.C., we runnin this rap shit<br/>
M-Easy, we runnin this rap shit<br/>
The Broad Street Bully, we runnin this rap shit<br/>
Get zipped up in plastic when it happens that's it<br/>

"Watch out!! We run New York" -&gt; <i>[KRS-One]</i><br/>
<br/>
A wise man told me don't argue with fools<br/>
Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who<br/>
So stop with that childish shit, nigga I'm grown<br/>
Please leave it alone - don't throw rocks at the throne<br/>
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you<br/>
I don't know why your advisors ain't forewarn you<br/>
Please, not Jay, he's, not for play<br/>
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin and gimmicks<br/>
I will end it, all that yappin be finished<br/>
You are not deep, you made your bed now sleep<br/>
Don't make me expose to them folks that don't know you<br/>
Nigga I know you well, all the stolen jew-els<br/>
Twinkletoes you breakin my heart<br/>
You can't fuck with me - go play somewhere, I'm busy<br/>
And all you other cats throwin shots at Jigga<br/>
You only get half a bar - fuck y'all niggaz
