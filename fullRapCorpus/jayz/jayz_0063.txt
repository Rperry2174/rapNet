<br/>
It's the Dynasty niggaz... as promised...<br/>
The world's most infamous...<br/>
Roc-A-Fella Records...<br/>
This is Roc La Familia...<br/>
It's Young Hova... Beanie Sigel... Memphis Bleek... Amil-lion...<br/>
It's the Dynasty niggaz... 2000 to infinity...<br/>
This is ghetto to ghetto.. gutter to gutter..<br/>
Street corner to street corner.. project to project..<br/>
Worldwide... walk with us niggaz...<br/>
Hoffa... Dash... it's the Dynasty niggaz<br/>
Check it out...<br/>
Uhh... walk with me... talk to me... yo..<br/>
<br/>
The theme song to (The Sopranos)<br/>
plays in the key of life on my, mental piano<br/>
Got a strange way of seein life like<br/>
I'm Stevie Wonder with, beads under the doo-rag<br/>
Intuition is there even when my vision's impaired, yeah<br/>
Knowin I can go, just switchin a spare<br/>
On the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight<br/>
Oh!  Keen senses ever since I was a, teen on the benches<br/>
everytime somebody like Enus was mentioned<br/>
I would turn green, me, bein in the trenches<br/>
Him, livin adventureous not worryin about expenditures<br/>
I'm bravin temperatures below zero, no hero<br/>
No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga<br/>
But I'm starvin my niggaz, and the weight loss in my figure<br/>
is startin to darken my heart, bout to get to my liver<br/>
Watch it my niggaz, I'm tryin to be calm but I'm gon' get richer<br/>
through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture<br/>
Never read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures<br/>
Only psalms I read was on the arms of my niggaz<br/>
Tattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious<br/>
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures<br/>
Niggaz, say it's the dawn/Don but I'm superstitious<br/>
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothin is goin as you predicted<br/>
I move with biscuits, stop the harder niggaz actin too suspicious<br/>
This is, food for thought, you do the dishes
