Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?<br/>
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane<br/>
Duckin the plain cops, pushin indo and 'caine<br/>
At the kitchen table late night, no pen, just my brain<br/>
First album niggaz love me cause they thought I was poor<br/>
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more<br/>
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin raw<br/>
Skully tilted, pants saggin, damn near touchin the floor<br/>
And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards<br/>
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all<br/>
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad<br/>
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path<br/>
A&amp;R's had me feelin like moss in the drab<br/>
So I turned the league out with "Reasonable Doubt"<br/>
Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song<br/>
I'm the illest nigga doin it til y'all prove me wrong<br/>
Do you believe?<br/>
It's Hova the God, uhh, uhh, uhh..
