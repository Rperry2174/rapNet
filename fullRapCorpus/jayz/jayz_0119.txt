Yeah it's magic<br/>
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz<br/>
And it's a Heavy D product you bastards<br/>
Come on<br/>
Ha hey yo stop playing man<br/>
This is real serious<br/>
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Post Postatono, Hov' hanging with Bono<br/>
You too can live like Salvatore Ferragamo<br/>
And you too can cool out poolside after Delano<br/>
And you too flow like you was out of your mind yo<br/>
And who knew dude who loved apple pies from McDonald's<br/>
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know<br/>
And who knew dude would play ball for the NBA<br/>
Would make a mistake on the who know it stayed still in the way<br/>
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play<br/>
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way<br/>
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day<br/>
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today<br/>
Now there's something you gotta say two times to Jay<br/>
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way<br/>
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action<br/>
Its safe when you play with skills, good luck could happen<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
(C'mon) It's the Roc <i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
It got to hot so I jumped off in this rap shit<br/>
You got it criss-crossed ain't no turning me backwards<br/>
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions<br/>
Of one individual he's criminally attached<br/>
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors<br/>
While dating all the models and actresses<br/>
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio<br/>
Trying not to mess up my axis kid<br/>
On the road to riches through trafficking<br/>
Through rappining whatever's happening<br/>
Roc-a-wear I'm the young black Ralph Lauren<br/>
Every time I get out they put me right back in<br/>
The Michael Corleone of the microphone<br/>
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems<br/>
I gather no moss like a rolling stone<br/>
Case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon<br/>
<br/>
(C'mon) It's the Roc <i>[3X]</i><br/>
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lenny Kravitz: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Life is all about Guns and Roses<br/>
Bittersweet like friends and foes<br/>
Some get left behind, some get chosen<br/>
Just like life, Guns and Roses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Tote, more Guns then Roses, foes is, visibly shook of the invisible book, let's go<br/>
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain<br/>
And in order to experience joy you need pain<br/>
Every time a baby is born, somebody slain<br/>
You know the saying, somebody's loss is another's gain<br/>
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain<br/>
A rainbow then the cloud comes out we do it again<br/>
Everything evens up, you just wait<br/>
Even a garbage can gets a steak<br/>
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith<br/>
But when it turns your way before it turns away<br/>
To turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay<br/>
You will get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go<br/>
<br/>
(C'mon) It's the Roc <i>[3X]</i><br/>
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lenny Kravitz: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Life is all about Guns and Roses<br/>
Bittersweet like friends and foes<br/>
Some get left behind, some get chosen<br/>
Just like life, Guns and Roses<br/>
<br/>
Life is all about Guns and Roses
