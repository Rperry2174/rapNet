<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Life is but a dream to me<br/>
I don't wanna wake up<br/>
Thirty odd years without having my cake up<br/>
So I'm about my paper<br/>
24/7, 365,366 in a leap year<br/>
I don't know why we here<br/>
Since we gotta be here<br/>
Life is but a beach chair<br/>
Went from having shabby clothes<br/>
Crossing over Abbey Roads<br/>
Hear my angels singing to me<br/>
Are you happy HOV?<br/>
I just hope I'm hearing right<br/>
Karma's got me fearing life<br/>
Colleek are you praying for me<br/>
See I got demons in my past<br/>
So I got daughters on the way<br/>
If the prophecy's correct<br/>
Then the child should have to pay<br/>
For the sins of a father<br/>
So I barter my tomorrows<br/>
Against my yesterdays<br/>
In hopes that she'll be OK<br/>
And when I'm no longer here<br/>
To shade her face from the glare<br/>
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter<br/>
and a new beach chair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Life is but a dream to me<br/>
Gun shots sing to these<br/>
Other guys but lullabies<br/>
Don't mean a thing to me<br/>
I'm not afraid of dying<br/>
I'm afraid of not trying<br/>
Everyday hit every wave<br/>
Like I'm Hawaiian<br/>
I don't surf the net<br/>
No I never been on myspace<br/>
Too busy letting my voice vibrate<br/>
Carving out my space<br/>
In this world of fly girls<br/>
Cutthroats &amp;  diamond cut ropes I twirls<br/>
Benzs round corners<br/>
Where the sun don't shine<br/>
I let the wheels give a glimpse<br/>
Of hope of one's grind<br/>
Some said HOV, how you get so fly<br/>
I said from not being afraid to fall out the sky<br/>
My physical's a shell<br/>
So when I say farewell<br/>
My soul will find an even<br/>
Higher plane to dwell<br/>
So fly you shall<br/>
So have no fear, just know that<br/>
Life is but a beach chair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Life is but a dream Can't mimic my life<br/>
I'm the thinnest cut slice<br/>
Intercut, the winner's cup<br/>
With winters rough enough<br/>
TO interrupt life<br/>
That's why I'm both<br/>
The saint &amp; the sinner<br/>
Nice<br/>
This is Jay everyday<br/>
No compromise<br/>
No compass comes with this life<br/>
Just eyes<br/>
So to map it out<br/>
You must look inside<br/>
Sure books can guide you<br/>
But your heart defines you<br/>
Chica<br/>
You corason is what brought us home<br/>
In great shape like Heidi Klum<br/>
Maricon, I am on<br/>
Permanent Vaca<br/>
Life is but a beach chair<br/>
This song is like a Hallmark card<br/>
Until you read each here<br/>
So till she's here<br/>
And she declared<br/>
The aire<br/>
I will prepare<br/>
A blueprint for you to print<br/>
A map for you to get back<br/>
A guide for your eyes<br/>
And so you won't lose scent<br/>
I'll make a stink for you to think<br/>
I ink these verses full of prose<br/>
So you won't get conned out of 2 cent<br/>
My last will and testament I leave my heir<br/>
My share of Roc-AFella Records and a new beach chair
