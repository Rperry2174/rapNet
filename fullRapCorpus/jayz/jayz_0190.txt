Roc-a-fella records<br/>
The imperial Skateboard P<br/>
Great Hova<br/>
Y'all already know what it is (Oh Shit!)<br/>
<br/>
C'mon!<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
So what if you flip a couple words<br/>
I could triple that in birds<br/>
open your mind you see the circus in the sky<br/>
I'm Ringling brothers Barnum and Bailey with the pies<br/>
No matter how you slice it I'm your motherfucking guy<br/>
Just like a B-Boy with 360 waves<br/>
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige.<br/>
Whether right or south paw, whether powder the jar<br/>
Whip it around, it still comes back hard.<br/>
So easily do I w-h-i-p<br/>
My repetition with wrists will bring you kilo biggers.<br/>
I got creole C.O. bitches for my niggas who slipped, became prisoners<br/>
Trees taped to the visitors<br/>
You already know what the business is<br/>
Unnecessary commissary, boy we live this shit<br/>
Niggas wanna bring the 80s back<br/>
It's OK with me, that's where they made me at<br/>
Except I don't write on the wall<br/>
I write my name in the history books, hustling in the hall (hustling in the hall)<br/>
Nah, I don't spin on my head<br/>
I spin work in the pots so I can spend my bread<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Pharrell):]</i><br/>
And I'm getting it, I'm getting it<br/>
I ain't talking about it, I'm living it<br/>
I'm getting it, straight getting it<br/>
Ge-ge-ge-get get get it boy<br/>
(Don't waste you time, fighting the life stay your course, and you'll understand)<br/>
Get it boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
It's '87 state of mind that I'm in (mind that I'm in)<br/>
In my prime, so for that time, I'm Rakim (I'm Rakim)<br/>
If it wasn't for the crime that I was in<br/>
But I wouldn't be the guy whose rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in)<br/>
No pain, no profit, P I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)<br/>
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)<br/>
Red and green G's all on my hat<br/>
North beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater<br/>
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together<br/>
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain<br/>
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game<br/>
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster<br/>
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra<br/>
I ran contraband that they sponsored<br/>
Before this rhyming stuff we was in concert<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Pharrell)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Push (push) money over broads, you got it, fuck Bush<br/>
Chef (chef), guess what I cooked<br/>
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books<br/>
Rockstar, look, way before the bars my picture was getting took<br/>
Feds, they like wack rappers, tried as they may, couldn't get me on the hook<br/>
D.A. wanna indict me<br/>
Cause fish scales in my veins like a pisces<br/>
The Pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves<br/>
Turn one into two like a Siamese<br/>
Twin when it end, I'm a stand as a man never dying on my knees<br/>
Last of a dying breed, so let the champagne pop<br/>
I partied for a while now I'm back to the block<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Pharrell)]</i>
