<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uh huh yea, yeah<br/>
Duro!<br/>
You gotta let it bump<br/>
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah<br/>
Come on bring the chorus in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1]</i><br/>
I'd risk everything<br/>
For one kiss, everything<br/>
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)<br/>
Anything for you<br/>
<br/>
I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trustin' that<br/>
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours<br/>
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa<br/>
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall<br/>
My brother from anotha pop, minus one shot<br/>
We Neno and G-Money man, we all we got<br/>
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops<br/>
And us gettin mad, throwin' rocks off the roof<br/>
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress<br/>
But look at us now man, we're young execs<br/>
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Tah<br/>
My nigga Ja, my nigga Gotti<br/>
We embody all that’s right with the world<br/>
No matter how pretty she is, you never likin' my girl<br/>
That's how we run, when you ain’t around<br/>
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line<br/>
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine<br/>
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
I know mama, your little baby<br/>
But these streets raised me crazy<br/>
Product of my environment, nothing can save me<br/>
Thanks for letting me bloom for your wisdom for your womb<br/>
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed<br/>
For the most important lesson in life was when you said<br/>
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"<br/>
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing when my asthma was bad<br/>
And my chest was weezin', thanks for the look of love<br/>
Just as I was leavin'<br/>
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back<br/>
That left you grieving'<br/>
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad<br/>
As the man, I apologize for my dad<br/>
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do<br/>
That wasn’t the life meant for you<br/>
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream<br/>
Everything that gleamed, everything that shines<br/>
Everything that’s mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it out, uh, uh<br/>
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad<br/>
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad<br/>
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad<br/>
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab<br/>
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad<br/>
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody<br/>
Don’t follow no nigga, that's hoe shit man<br/>
Stand on your own two, do your shit man<br/>
The world is yours<br/>
Some girls are nice some girls are whores<br/>
Don't listen to your crew<br/>
Do what works for you<br/>
Standin' back from situations gives you the perfect view<br/>
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass<br/>
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said<br/>
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed,<br/>
You know my number when it’s code red if you're wrong my nigga<br/>
You’re my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
