<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, listen<br/>
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up<br/>
Somebody got a problem with Hov'<br/>
What's up you all niggas all fed up 'cause I got a little cheddar<br/>
and my records moving out the store?<br/>
Young fucks spitting at me, young rappers getting at me<br/>
My nigga Big predicted the shit exactly<br/>
"More money, more problems" - gotta move carefully<br/>
'cause faggots hate when you getting money like athletes<br/>
Yung'uns ice-grilling me, oh - you're not feeling me?<br/>
Fine; it cost you nothing - pay me no mind<br/>
Look, I'm on my grind cousin, ain't got time for fronting<br/>
Sensitive thugs, you all need hugs<br/>
Damn though mans I'm just trying do me<br/>
If the record's two mill I'm just trying move three<br/>
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E<br/>
Hopefully they'll menage before I reach my garage<br/>
I don't want much, fuck I drove every car<br/>
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers<br/>
Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle you all<br/>
I know you're waiting in the wing but I'm doing my thing<br/>
Where's the love?<br/>
<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."<br/>
I said where's the love?<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."<br/>
Yeah..<br/>
<br/>
And then the Fugee's gonna break up, now everyday I wake up<br/>
Somebody got something to say<br/>
What's all the fucking fussing for? Because I'm grubbing more<br/>
and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?<br/>
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall<br/>
But everytime I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball<br/>
Now I don't wanna have to kill southpaw<br/>
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar<br/>
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after<br/>
I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past you<br/>
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper<br/>
Can I live? I told you in ninety-six<br/>
that I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz<br/>
I scramble like Randall with his<br/>
Cunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam<br/>
Jigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love?<br/>
<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."<br/>
Niggas, where's the love?<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."<br/>
Holla at me!!<br/>
"Ain't no love" (take 'em to church) "in the heart of the city.."<br/>
Uh, uh, uh - my nigga where's the love?<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."<br/>
Fuck<br/>
<br/>
Then Richard Pryor go and burn up, and Ike and Tina Turner break up<br/>
Then I wake up to more bullshit<br/>
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me<br/>
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit<br/>
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss<br/>
Let's end the speculation, I'm talking to all you<br/>
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait<br/>
Watch you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?<br/>
You all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy a bigger place<br/>
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?<br/>
Nigga respect the game, that should be it<br/>
What you eat don't make me shit - where's the love?<br/>
<br/>
Where's the love?<br/>
<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."<br/>
"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."<br/>
<br/>
"Ain't no love.."
