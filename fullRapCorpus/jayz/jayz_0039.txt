<i>[Sheek]</i><br/>
Fuck -- shit is real right here<br/>
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers<br/>
Don't get it twisted<br/>
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo<br/>
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass<br/>
with no mask, look at the camera like what?<br/>
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed<br/>
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy<br/>
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal<br/>
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids<br/>
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?<br/>
And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care<br/>
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs<br/>
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children<br/>
when I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building<br/>
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores<br/>
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores<br/>
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way<br/>
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray<br/>
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall<br/>
Takin shots of Louie til I fall<br/>
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove<br/>
and kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move<br/>
My team, you would think was on Thorazine<br/>
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now<br/>
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down<br/>
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now<br/>
Beanie Mac I supply it now<br/>
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats<br/>
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps<br/>
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks<br/>
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats<br/>
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?<br/>
Until you have me, test my aim?<br/>
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles<br/>
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule<br/>
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin<br/>
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin<br/>
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin<br/>
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction<br/>
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin<br/>
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin<br/>
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct<br/>
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend<br/>
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss]</i><br/>
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box<br/>
Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops<br/>
You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX<br/>
If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot<br/>
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family<br/>
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami<br/>
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper<br/>
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper<br/>
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag<br/>
you gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it<br/>
Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce<br/>
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce<br/>
They got me where I can't be without my large gat<br/>
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat<br/>
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline<br/>
Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines<br/>
Six months in the county or fed time<br/>
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime<br/>
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga<br/>
ever had beef with, son is a bastard<br/>
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.<br/>
Ruffryder you heard? We got the game mastered<br/>
<br/>
I told you the pain was comin<br/>
You wouldn't listen<br/>
You tried to play me like a joke?<br/>
Now who got the last laugh?<br/>
Now take these bullets with you to hell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sauce Money]</i><br/>
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit<br/>
So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick<br/>
Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy<br/>
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die<br/>
What's the difference? Either way I'm stunnin your crew<br/>
I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose<br/>
Somethin to prove? Spit it, we can have a sprayoff<br/>
I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off<br/>
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off<br/>
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off<br/>
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews<br/>
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews<br/>
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch<br/>
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with<br/>
I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin<br/>
for you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Styles]</i><br/>
I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are<br/>
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car<br/>
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot<br/>
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop<br/>
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked<br/>
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash<br/>
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz<br/>
Shootin backwards, just for practice<br/>
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket<br/>
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you<br/>
Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you<br/>
I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock<br/>
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock<br/>
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven<br/>
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me<br/>
I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella<br/>
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers<br/>
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma<br/>
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta<br/>
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna<br/>
Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners<br/>
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon<br/>
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed<br/>
Get brained in the four dot six Range<br/>
Shit main, switch lanes<br/>
every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine<br/>
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain<br/>
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that<br/>
You don't wanna owe that man<br/>
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man<br/>
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more<br/>
I just sit on my money til I'm above the law<br/>
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses<br/>
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga<br/>
Multiple cars and divas with D-classes<br/>
Iceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic<br/>
Shit, beyotch! What the fuck, ya heard me?<br/>
Put some more beat on that joint
