<i>[Sean Paul]</i><br/>
Yo Yo Yo, Yo Yo Yo<br/>
Show out her wild side, stick out her backside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time<br/>
Ladies, if you with me, just grind to the bass line<br/>
Homey, don't be scared to grab her from behind<br/>
And make her show out her wild side<br/>
(Sean Paul) Stick out her backside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Now what the fuck they gon' do with me<br/>
Got money, got broads, got a crew with me<br/>
Real as banana clips, I got a Sue with me<br/>
Get down or lay down nigga to shoot with me<br/>
Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me<br/>
I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me<br/>
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me<br/>
You scared motherfucker, keep it real with me, keep it real with me<br/>
Now what the fuck they gon say to me<br/>
Got to clap, yi mean all day with me, CLAP, yi mean<br/>
Don't play with me, CLAP, yi mean<br/>
Stay with me, don't lose me y'all<br/>
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different<br/>
I bought it back for a living<br/>
33 O's on a bitch back like Pippen<br/>
3 She can keep for herself and distribute<br/>
36 O's and a ki, you do the addition<br/>
Before Mitchell and Ness did it<br/>
I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted<br/>
I'm Cal Ripken Jr. let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Hon' what they gon' say to you<br/>
Got your hair did and your favorite shoes<br/>
Tell'em don't play with you, get'em away from you<br/>
You need a baller like I, call'em like I<br/>
See'em like naaaa<br/>
Move over y'all amateurs<br/>
No, you not balling that's Pro-Am shit<br/>
Oh, stop calling that's hoe-man shit<br/>
Stop falling asleep that's old man shit<br/>
I stands up in it like a champ up in it<br/>
Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it<br/>
No more minute man in it<br/>
Get my Soundscan, BDS, and Market and Glance in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
What they gon do'<br/>
You got starch in your flow<br/>
I flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow<br/>
All sorts of flow, Rembrandt, Rilkey<br/>
I am art with the flow<br/>
Even if I'm filthy, you gotta pardon the flow<br/>
Niggas taking it lightly, had to darken the flow<br/>
Way I put it together, tear'em apart with the flow<br/>
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow<br/>
Stop it youngin, you 106th &amp; Park with the flow<br/>
I am pro, as you see I'm off the charts with the flow<br/>
Actually I'm number one on the charts with the flow<br/>
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow<br/>
Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow<br/>
(Oh no) I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow<br/>
Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow<br/>
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow<br/>
Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
