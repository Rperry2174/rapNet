Young!  For life<br/>
Once again it's the life, yessss<br/>
(I don't know why, I.. get so high on)<br/>
It's intoxicatin man, y'all don't know why you do what you do<br/>
(Get so high on, get so high - high off the life)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
The allure of breakin the law<br/>
Is always too much for me to ever ignore<br/>
I gotta thing for them big body Benzes, it dulls my senses<br/>
In love with a V-Dub engine<br/>
Man I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted<br/>
Bey Venay kicks, or them Marvin Kaye wrists<br/>
My women friend get tennis bracelets<br/>
Trips to Venice, get they winters replaced with<br/>
The sun, it ain't even fun no more I'm jaded<br/>
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it<br/>
I put my feet in the footprints left to me<br/>
Without sayin a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy<br/>
Man my brother hustled so, naturally<br/>
Up next is me, but what perplexes me<br/>
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play<br/>
The starrin role in "Hovito's Way"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's just life, I solemnly swear<br/>
To change my approach, stop shavin coke<br/>
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast<br/>
Cause I be doin the most.. oh no!<br/>
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back<br/>
It called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinkin distilled vodka<br/>
'Til I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real<br/>
Peal the top up like a toupee<br/>
Mix the water, with the soda<br/>
Turn the pot up make a souflee<br/>
All of y'all can get it like group page in your 2-way<br/>
I'm livin proof that crime do pay<br/>
Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads<br/>
Puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game<br/>
Puttin 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train<br/>
All in the name of love<br/>
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came<br/>
Over the house to take back, everything that they claimed<br/>
Or even the worst pain is the distress<br/>
Learnin you're the mistress only after that love gets slain<br/>
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust<br/>
Now it gets tough to ever love a-gain<br/>
But the allure of the game, keeps callin your name<br/>
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain<br/>
To all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes<br/>
We all hustlers, in love with the same thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
I never felt more alive than ridin shotgun<br/>
In Cline's green 5 until the cops pulled guns<br/>
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need<br/>
What the game did to my pulse, with no results<br/>
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close<br/>
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts<br/>
And I'm just a moth, addicted to the floss<br/>
And doors lift from the floor and the tops come off<br/>
By any means necessary, whatever the cost<br/>
Even if it means lives is lost..<br/>
And I can't explain why, I just love to get high<br/>
Drink life, smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice<br/>
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times<br/>
I may not even be alive<br/>
How mean James Dean couldn't escape the allure<br/>
Dyin young, leavin a good lookin corpse<br/>
Of course<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Once again it's the life<br/>
I said it's the life<br/>
Once again it's the life - oh no!<br/>
(I don't why I) why I (get so high on)<br/>
Get so (get so high on) uh-huh<br/>
(get so high - high off the life!)<br/>
Hahahahahahaha - woo!
