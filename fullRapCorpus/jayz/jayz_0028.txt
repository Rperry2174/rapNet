<i>[Kelly Price (Jay-Z)]</i><br/>
Talking: Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)<br/>
no matter what I've done.(Right)<br/>
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)<br/>
through all things (ye yeah) For that<br/>
I am eternally grateful.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Since my date of birth<br/>
bought you nothing but hurt<br/>
play those video games<br/>
stole change from ya purse<br/>
Sat on the cold court bench<br/>
'til I was arraigned in ya skirt<br/>
Saw the pain in ya face<br/>
through you maintained a smirk<br/>
All you did was motivate me<br/>
don't let 'em hold you back<br/>
What I do I turned around<br/>
and I sold you crack<br/>
I was a bastard for that<br/>
still I'm drowning in shame<br/>
Just remember one thing now<br/>
you're not to blame<br/>
You was newly seperated<br/>
tryin' to escape ya world<br/>
and through my thirst<br/>
I didn't help you<br/>
I just made things worse<br/>
I hated me and everybody<br/>
that created crack<br/>
Had me thinkin'<br/>
the newest kicks and the latest gat<br/>
Still haven't apologized<br/>
so please play this back<br/>
while I try to come to terms<br/>
with such a heinous act<br/>
you know in more than one way<br/>
cocaine numbs the brain<br/>
All I did was think about<br/>
how the funds once came<br/>
then I ran across this memory<br/>
and it stung the brain<br/>
How can you ever destroy the beauty<br/>
from which one came<br/>
That's a savage you're the reason<br/>
why me and these beats make a marriage<br/>
why I rhyme above average and<br/>
I ain't shit<br/>
Glad you got yourself together<br/>
no thanks to me<br/>
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be<br/>
You must love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (K. Price) (You must love me repeats in background)]</i><br/>
Say that you love me<br/>
All I know say that you must love me.<br/>
Ohh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
We used to fight every night<br/>
but I never would suffer<br/>
just smile my big brother's<br/>
tryna make me tougher<br/>
As we grew fussing and fighting continued<br/>
as I plundered through ya stuff<br/>
and snuck ya clothes to school<br/>
Got intense real intense<br/>
as we got older<br/>
Never believed it would lead<br/>
to be popped in one in ya shoulda<br/>
Where my rings? Knew you had it<br/>
'cause you took too long<br/>
as Mickey, Andy, and the girl that bought it looked on<br/>
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand<br/>
told you step outside<br/>
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride<br/>
made our way down the steps<br/>
maybe you thought it was just a threat<br/>
or maybe ya life was just that crazy<br/>
and you was beggin' for death<br/>
try to justify this in my young mind<br/>
but ya drillin' it<br/>
and my ego hurt combined<br/>
drove me berzerk<br/>
Saw the devil in your eyes<br/>
high off more than weed<br/>
confused I just closed<br/>
my young eyes and squeezed<br/>
What a sound<br/>
opened my eyes just in time<br/>
to see ya stumbling to the ground<br/>
Damn what the fuck I done now<br/>
runnin' around in a circle<br/>
thinking I'm assed out<br/>
hot gun burnin' my waist<br/>
ran straight to Jazz' house<br/>
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga<br/>
and ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga<br/>
Left the scene how could I go out that way<br/>
Still you asked to see me in the hospital ya next day<br/>
You must love me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (You must love me repeats in background)]</i><br/>
What after all the wrong I've done<br/>
I know you must<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Starts over last line of chorus)]</i><br/>
Everything in my power and within my frame<br/>
to protect you from this life and<br/>
keep you away from the game<br/>
But you was one of the few people<br/>
that I can trust<br/>
and the fact of the matter I slang<br/>
these pies for us<br/>
You put the pressure on me dearly<br/>
rarely would you let it go<br/>
Was a thousand and one times<br/>
I had to tell you no<br/>
When it was one of those days<br/>
when nobody was around<br/>
and I needed emergency trip<br/>
out of town<br/>
Searched my mental rolodex<br/>
for all the numbers I know<br/>
As you stared in my face<br/>
asking me could you go<br/>
I'm agreed said sender<br/>
everything'll go smooth<br/>
just tell her what to do<br/>
and everything'll go through<br/>
Strapped her body with them thangs<br/>
as you boarded the plane<br/>
Couldn't explain these strange feelings<br/>
that I caught and the pain<br/>
I'm thinkin' why would I send you<br/>
when I knew it ain't right<br/>
I'm thinkin' what would<br/>
make you sacrifice ya life<br/>
You must love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (You must love me repeats in background)]</i><br/>
After everything that I've done wrong<br/>
I know inside you must love me<br/>
I know that you love me<br/>
You showed me I know it<br/>
I know<br/>
Say that you love me<br/>
say that you love me<br/>
I know you must love me<br/>
Oh yes you do<br/>
Inside I know it<br/>
you've always shown it<br/>
you love me yea yeah<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
I know that you love me
