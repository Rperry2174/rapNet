Yeah<br/>
I mean like<br/>
I gotta be like the pioneer to this shit, you know<br/>
I was popping that Cristal<br/>
when all y'all niggaz thought it was beer and shit, you know<br/>
Wearing that platinum shit<br/>
when all y'all chicks thought it was silver and shit<br/>
I got to be the pioneer of this shit<br/>
Bottom line<br/>
I'm going to show you how to do it<br/>
Check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
I spit that other shit <br/>
That's the nice motherfucker shit<br/>
Fed time follow me around, deep cover shit nigga<br/>
You beer money, I'm all year money<br/>
I'm popping, you ain't got to count it, it's all there money<br/>
I never change money 'cause niggas got strange money<br/>
Knocked up, marked up, fucked up in the game money<br/>
I got bail money, XXL money <br/>
You got flash now, one time we'll reveal money<br/>
I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit<br/>
That down South Master P, Bout It Bout It shit<br/>
I got blood money, straight up thug money<br/>
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money <br/>
You got show dough, little to no dough<br/>
Sell a bunch of records and you still owe dough <br/>
I got 900 and 96 plus 4 more dough<br/>
You crazy, you full gazy, and loco with dough papo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (4x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Imaginary Players<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
And now you got these young cats acting like they slung cats<br/>
All in they dumb rap, talking about how they funds stack<br/>
When I see them in the street, I don't see none of that<br/>
Bad playboy, where the fuck is the hummer at?<br/>
Where is all the ice with all the platinum under that?<br/>
Those ain't rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?<br/>
Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me<br/>
Selling records, being you but still you want to be me<br/>
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me<br/>
And still you running around thinking you got something on me<br/>
But I done did it<br/>
And y'all want to take my flow, and run with it<br/>
That's cool, I was the first one with it<br/>
Original, jiggas the future flow digital<br/>
Still busting a gat when she gets critical<br/>
Sit it down, I don't want y'all to get it confused<br/>
I rip it down, like I ain't got nothing to lose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
Groupies I leave them all fucked <br/>
Niggas - all struck<br/>
Your single was 99 cents, mines was 4 bucks<br/>
Last year, when niggas thought it was all up<br/>
But this year I've done it again, jigga! <br/>
What the fuck<br/>
Nigga stop whining, jigga, still shining<br/>
Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds<br/>
Rock more Versace, ain't nothing sweet<br/>
I still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party<br/>
Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me <br/>
Bet 50, not dollars either I brought some dough with me<br/>
I flow like the 5 series, in various areas<br/>
And blow holes in your weak niggas theories<br/>
It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game<br/>
You bought a 4.0 you better get your change<br/>
Ain't no platinum in those Cartiers, switch your frame<br/>
Ain't no manicures on board, then switch your plane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
