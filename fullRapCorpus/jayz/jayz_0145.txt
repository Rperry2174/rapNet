I love ‘em all but none of yall can fuck with the double suicide doors on that black phantom,<br/>
Fuck em all<br/>
We got hits like a 30 shot clip when we throw one in the air everybody hit the floor<br/>
Holla atcha boy, boys, when we boys so we bringin out them toys<br/>
Lane to lane on the dana danes<br/>
We give you noise man when the year change we change, nigga we right here<br/>
We can go bang for bang<br/>
We can go clip for clip nigga chain for chain<br/>
We can go bitch for bitch got a pretty young thing<br/>

OH! Best of Both Worlds)<br/>
Best of Both Worlds and we rock the globe<br/>
You knamsayin<br/>
Ya boy H-O wit Kels we not playin<br/>
Losers lose so when we does what we do we win<br/>
Then win again like de ja vu<br/>
Then we win again like MJ do<br/>
Three-peat then retreat the waters that’s blue<br/>
Young scrappy this what grown men do lets move!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly (2x)]</i><br/>
In this arena, arena<br/>
All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up<br/>
This is for them hustling boys and girls <br/>
It’s the return of Best of Both Worlds<br/>
