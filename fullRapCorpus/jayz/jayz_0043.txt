<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD<br/>
If you like me you readin the credits right now<br/>
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter<br/>
I want you to put all your windows down<br/>
Zone out, buckle up, let's go<br/>
<br/>
Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over<br/>
The new millineum is upon us, the album is here<br/>
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear<br/>
Rappers with no relation:<br/>
there's "Seven Degrees of Seperation" and I'm Kevin Bacon<br/>
This is the murderer's version<br/>
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person<br/>
Hova the God, I should be rappin with turban<br/>
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him<br/>
Mike Jordan of rap - outside J workin<br/>
Now watch how quickly I drop 50<br/>
I don't like playin, niggaz can't stick me<br/>
Niggaz can not jam me, niggaz can't get me<br/>
Slimmy at the Rucka wanna leave and spend with me<br/>
I consistantly take em out the park like Ken Griffey<br/>
Do you believe? It's Hova the God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pain In Da Ass]</i><br/>
Makes you think about the people in your life<br/>
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here<br/>
He'd say, "Jay, what's it about? What's life about?<br/>
If you don't go through as a man's a man"<br/>
He'd say, "Suck it up, take the fall, do the time <br/>
that's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are"<br/>
How many years you been around this thing of ours?<br/>
Commision, 125 years<br/>
What's it about?<br/>
It's about rules, parameters<br/>
You take the beatin for the friend you don't lay down<br/>
you don't betray who you are, what you are<br/>
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory<br/>
They don't roar, they don't rap<br/>
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them<br/>
You was born to be somethin I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble<br/>
Okaay so you humble me now, what you got?<br/>
You got a war, you got global war <br/>
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now<br/>
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings<br/>
There's no feelings for this game<br/>
So.. five ten years from now<br/>
You're gonna wish there was American Commision<br/>
Five ten years from now...<br/>
They're gonna miss Jay-Z<br/>
Oahhhkayyyyy, I'm reloaded!!!!!
