Dreamed of you this morning<br/>
Then came the dawn, and I thought you were here with me<br/>
If you could only see<br/>
How much i love you<br/>
That's all that's all that's all baby<br/>
Oh no, I'll never give up on you<br/>
I never felt that before<br/>
But there's always....<br/>
That's all that's all...<br/>
<br/>
This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin' out<br/>
Back-back-backing them Beemer's out<br/>
Seems as our plans to get a grant<br/>
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out<br/>
We need it now, we need a town<br/>
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound<br/>
For now, I'm just a lazy boy<br/>
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy<br/>
In the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin<br/>
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin' bout Harvard<br/>
But that's too far away, niggas are starving<br/>
Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target<br/>
I got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows<br/>
I see pies everytime my eyes clidd-ose<br/>
I see rides, sixes, i gotta get those<br/>
Life's a bitch, I hope not to make her a widow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Oh no, I'll never give up on you<br/>
I never felt that before<br/>
Its just American dreamin'<br/>
Oh no, I'll never give up on you<br/>
I never felt that before<br/>
Its just American dreamin'<br/>
Oh no, I'll never give up on you<br/>
I never felt that before<br/>
American dreamin'<br/>
But there's always....<br/>
That's all that's all...<br/>
<br/>
Now see, the life's right there<br/>
And it seems right there<br/>
Its not quite near,<br/>
And its not like we're professionals movin' the decimals<br/>
Know where to cop? Nah! got a connect? No!<br/>
Who under Heaven know how to be successful<br/>
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode<br/>
They say its celestial, its all in the stars<br/>
It's like Tony LaRussa<br/>
On how you play your cards<br/>
You all ain't fucking with me!<br/>
The ironies are<br/>
And at all costs better before he was bars<br/>
Now lets start, on your mark<br/>
Get set, lets go-get out the car!<br/>
Going in circles, its a vicious cycle<br/>
This is a crash course, this ain't high school<br/>
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreamin' again<br/>
Your own reality show, the season begins<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Step One in this process, scramble up in your projects<br/>
And head to the heights where big coke is processed<br/>
You gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct<br/>
Please speak slow, cause he no speakey no English<br/>
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips<br/>
If your money is straight, he's gonna give you consignment<br/>
You're now in a game where only time can tell<br/>
Survive the droughts, i wish you well...<br/>
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?<br/>
How sick am i? I wish you HEALTH<br/>
I wish you wheels, i wish you wealth<br/>
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself<br/>
You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'<br/>
And the cops is comin', you could read they mind<br/>
You could see from behind, you could redefine<br/>
The game as we know it, one dream at a time<br/>
I'm American dreamin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
