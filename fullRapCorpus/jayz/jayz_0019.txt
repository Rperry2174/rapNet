Uh-huh uh huh uh<br/>
Gee-gee-geyeah<br/>
Baby, watchin, streets<br/>
Uh-huh uh huh uh<br/>
You don't have to look<br/>
Uh-huh uh<br/>
The streets is watching<br/>
Check it, check<br/>
Uh-huh uh, check<br/>
<br/>
Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless<br/>
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do?<br/>
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking<br/>
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake<br/>
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted<br/>
But my time is money, at twenty-five, I can't afford it<br/>
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates<br/>
niggaz you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it<br/>
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass<br/>
This rhyme, you're operating on fuck time<br/>
Y'all niggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggaz<br/>
tryin to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale<br/>
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops<br/>
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop<br/>
Would I rather be on tour getting a, hundred a pop<br/>
Taking pictures with some bitches, in front of the drop<br/>
The streets is watching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When the, streets is watching<br/>
Blocks keep clocking<br/>
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake<br/>
Can't ignore it<br/>
<br/>
Now it's hard not to kill niggaz<br/>
It's like a full time job not to kill niggaz, can't chill<br/>
the streets is watching you, when you froze your arms<br/>
niggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm<br/>
Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up<br/>
Sweet niggaz running 'round swearing shit is sweeter<br/>
Once you're tagged lame the game is follow the leader<br/>
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer<br/>
Kidnap niggaz wanna steal ya<br/>
Broke niggaz want no cash, they just wanna kill ya<br/>
for the name, niggaz don't know the rules<br/>
Disrespectin the game, want you to blow your cool<br/>
Force your hand, of course that man's plottin<br/>
Smarten up, the streets is watching, it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
My street mentality flip bricks forever, know me and money<br/>
we like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together<br/>
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground<br/>
Hustle harder to see if indictment time came around<br/>
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found<br/>
Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain't me now<br/>
Got a face too easy to trace, niggaz mouths got slow leaks<br/>
Had to hide between my workers, couldn't play those streets<br/>
She got his face like Mercury you jerkin me? Hectic<br/>
Had to call upon my wolves to send, niggaz the message<br/>
I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here<br/>
I'm trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycare'<br/>
Hey there's money to be made and, niggaz got the picture<br/>
Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer<br/>
Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff<br/>
had warrants, the other half, in the casket lay dormant<br/>
I felt like life was cheating me, for the first time<br/>
in my life I was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me<br/>
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that?<br/>
I'm playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back<br/>
like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mindframe bad<br/>
Was niggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack?<br/>
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack<br/>
and knock a lot like two trains that's on the same track<br/>
'Fore I get my life together like the oars I bring back<br/>
In the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot<br/>
Got my transporter take it 'cross the border then stop<br/>
Set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan<br/>
For three straight weeks, niggaz slaughtered the block<br/>
But you know the game is 'lluted, fucked up me and my dues<br/>
One drop can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops<br/>
and this unstable way of living just, had to stop<br/>
Half of my niggaz got time, we done real things<br/>
By ninety-four became the subject of half of y'all niggaz rhymes<br/>
Public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street<br/>
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets<br/>
The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime<br/>
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind<br/>
I figured, 'Shit why risk myself I just write it in rhymes<br/>
And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine'<br/>
The mindstate, of a nigga who boosted the crime rate<br/>
so high in one city they send National Guards to get me<br/>
Ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
The streets
