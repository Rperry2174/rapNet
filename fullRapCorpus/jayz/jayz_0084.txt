<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Turn my music high, high, high, high-er<br/>
"You don't know.. what you're doing, doing, doing, doing.."<br/>
Sure I do..<br/>
<br/>
I'm from the streets where the<br/>
hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow a man<br/>
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom<br/>
And cops comb the shit top to bottom<br/>
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home<br/>
Where personalities crash and chrome meets chrome<br/>
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street homes<br/>
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown<br/>
all over that brown Brougham, one slip you are now gone<br/>
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell<br/>
But when them shells come you better return 'em<br/>
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand<br/>
We watch for cops hoppin out the back of van<br/>
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need that for damn<br/>
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it<br/>
Was clappin them flamers before I became famous<br/>
For playin me y'all shall forever remain nameless<br/>
I am Hov'<br/>
<br/>
Sure I do, I tell you the difference between me and them<br/>
They tryin to get they ones, I'm tryin to get them M's<br/>
One million, two million, three million, four<br/>
In just five years, forty million more<br/>
You are now lookin at the forty million boy<br/>
I'm rapin Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man<br/>
R., O., C.<br/>
<br/>
"You don't know.. what you're doing, doing, doing, doing.."<br/>
That's where you're wrong<br/>
<br/>
I came into this motherfucker a hundred grand strong<br/>
Nine to be exact, from grindin G-packs<br/>
Put this shit in motion ain't no rewindin me back<br/>
Could make 40 off a brick but one rhyme could beat that<br/>
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothin<br/>
Heh, not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind<br/>
That's another difference that's between me and them<br/>
Heh, I'm smarten up, open the market up<br/>
One million, two million, three million, four<br/>
In eighteen months, eighty million more<br/>
Now add that number up with the one I said before<br/>
You are now lookin at one smart black boy<br/>
Momma ain't raised no fool<br/>
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth<br/>
Motherfucker - I, will, not, lose<br/>
<br/>
"You don't know.. what you're doing, doing, doing, doing.."<br/>
Put somethin on it<br/>
<br/>
I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell<br/>
I am a hustler baby, I'll sell water to a well<br/>
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states<br/>
Cop the Coupe with the roof gone and switch plates<br/>
Was born to dictate, never follow orders<br/>
Dickface, get your shit straight, fucka this is Big Jay<br/>
I.. hahahaha..<br/>
<br/>
"You don't know.. what you're doing, doing, doing, doing.."<br/>
.. will, not, lose, ever.. FUCKA!
