<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ha ha, ha ha, Roc-a-Fella y'all<br/>
Futuristic shit beeotch<br/>
Uh, what the fuck? How we do. How we do. Uh ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Triple platnum nigga with the solid gold fade<br/>
All that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight<br/>
Fortune 5, top 5 in the Forbes (you'll see) as you<br/>
Thumb through the Source I read the Ride report<br/>
Class C, cold me down with the plastic<br/>
That's all I Ask Of You, like Raphael Saadiq<br/>
At the hotel, Nico, robbin' the val suite<br/>
My people's eyes through the peep hole<br/>
I'm lovin' you down freak as I<br/>
Shoot through the city like a rumor<br/>
Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreadin' the news<br/>
Paper headin' read "Jay-Z breaths, 80 degrees"<br/>
the only thing to cool them off is a Malibu day breeze<br/>
Can't sop for the feds, say cheese<br/>
You know they wanna take a nigga picture<br/>
Pray for the day to get ya, but I'm a parlay and stay richer for now<br/>
Jigga hasn't done dirt in a while<br/>
YOu know my stomach getin' weak from livin' on the streets for real<br/>
Tryin' to oversee it from suites, orderin' eats<br/>
At the top where the criminal minds meet<br/>
That's where the cream is (right) , that's where your dream is (well ain't<br/>
it?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You're only a customer (uh)<br/>
Walkin' in the presence of hustlers<br/>
You spend money all night long<br/>
"All night long" - Mary J. Blige<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
A-yo my youth had a nigga too aggressive<br/>
I use to speed excessive, both eyes closed<br/>
No thought infested<br/>
Hittin' pot holes, cop-o's will snatch your weight<br/>
But your game most precious<br/>
Had to rethink things, is pinky ring worth<br/>
Life on the run and time served in Sing Sing<br/>
I don't know to tell the truth<br/>
If I'm pressed for doe, I got to consoul Irv Gotti y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Irv Gotti:]</i><br/>
Heads got to roll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I was raised to live, Lord I pray you forgive<br/>
If not, I just handle it like Jason Kidd<br/>
What you're facin' is official (it's official)<br/>
Most cases when I"m blazin' won't miss you (won't miss you)<br/>
Case and point mad bullshitted issue<br/>
I see it to the end, my writting is so personal<br/>
My heart bleedin' out my pen, make no mistake aobut me<br/>
It's only one nigga livin', I got a half a cake about me<br/>
I got love, to make a nigga die bleedin' is nothin'<br/>
You make a motherfucker die breathin' then you sayin' somthing, beeotch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook X3]</i><br/>
<br/>
More flavor than y'all can image havin'<br/>
Graphic like Sega, Saturn, traffic like the Bodega<br/>
It just so happens, you caught me at the the tail end of my dive<br/>
My brain ain't right from inhaling the work of my life<br/>
Fuck it, 3's in ya, had to hold<br/>
D.C. high pissy off Cristle<br/>
3 G's high seasoned Bacardy, UV's<br/>
Blesses my body, we be fresh at the party<br/>
Play yourself go head if you don't no the ledge<br/>
It's like spittin' to God<br/>
Get it in your face fuckin' with niggas over your head<br/>
Take your time with me, shiftee<br/>
Use to make Coke stretch like the samplin' a 950<br/>
Shit with that, while I'm o a Kawasoki bike<br/>
At the light, doin' a pike, with a bitch on the back<br/>
And take flight, my life like it was directed by Hype<br/>
In 35 slow-mo, with the Rockafella logo<br/>
Accapoco to Arruba, bay breezes and caviar baluga<br/>
Very little loot, a loser<br/>
In the grashish blueish, Les Coup it's the root of evil in these people<br/>
<br/>
