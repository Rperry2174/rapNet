All rhymers with Alzheimers line up please,<br/>
All mommies with mind freeze please line up please,<br/>
All bloggers with comments,<br/>
Please I come in peace,<br/>
See if we can kill your amnesia by the time I leave,<br/>
All mommies I harbour for vouch for me,<br/>
Tell em bout the time all your mommas couch mommy<br/>
All hustlas who ever bought an eighth from me,<br/>
Take the time out to set the record straight for me,<br/>
Remember me, silver bullet hard top mentally<br/>
They think think I'm outta shape so I have to jog there memory,<br/>
Think with indelible ink, I let the pen go,<br/>
Verses permanently tattooed serve as mementos,<br/>
Ah, im so mental, my track record speaks for itself,<br/>
Im so instrumental,<br/>
Allow me to rekindle lets all reminisce like Mary did,<br/>
Think I have to send you a reminder,<br/>
Here it is,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
I got it if you need it,<br/>
A reminder<br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
Think I better give you a reminder,<br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
I got it if you need it,<br/>
A reminder<br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
Cos I can give you a friendly reminder,<br/>
<br/>
Ah,<br/>
What the hell have you done,<br/>
To even have an opinion on what I been doing,<br/>
What the hell have y'all won,<br/>
Only thing you can identify with is losing,<br/>
10 number 1 albums in a row,<br/>
Who better than me?<br/>
Only the Beatles nobody ahead of me,<br/>
I crush Elvis in his blue suede shoes,<br/>
Made the rolling stones seem sweet as coolaid 2,<br/>
96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001 and beyond,<br/>
02, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 7, 08, 09<br/>
Back to back double plat, I did what you want,<br/>
Men lie women lie, numbers don't,<br/>
Ain't nothing changed for me except the year it is,<br/>
I think have to send you a reminder, here it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
I got it if you need it,<br/>
A reminder<br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
Think I better give you a reminder,<br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
I got it if you need it,<br/>
A reminder<br/>
Reminder<br/>
Reminder,<br/>
Cos I can give you a friendly reminder,<br/>
<br/>
Do what I done without crying in the environment and what ya'll did it in without dying my n-gga,<br/>
Rap like I rap without lying and then tying both together like iron my n-gga,<br/>
Write 16's in between running 16 businesses,<br/>
All the while showing these young punks what the business is,<br/>
As if I'm gonna let you n-ggas style on me,<br/>
As if,<br/>
Now everybody senile on me,<br/>
Go back to boonback,<br/>
Remember those button ups,<br/>
Young Hov,<br/>
Tell them ordinary Joes button up,<br/>
I destroy your 4 points O's<br/>
And Benz 500 and all points to Ohhhh,<br/>
Now you n-ggas 'memba me,<br/>
How you forget, back to johnnys album cover,<br/>
Red and blue Gucci sh-t,<br/>
Ain't nothing changed but the year it is,<br/>
I think I have to send you a reminder here it is,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
