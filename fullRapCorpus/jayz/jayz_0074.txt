<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy<br/>
What's the problem shorty?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shorty]</i><br/>
Yeah whattup man<br/>
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man<br/>
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it<br/>
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message<br/>
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around<br/>
but I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown<br/>
I get that butter all night<br/>
cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike<br/>
They keep buyin hard white<br/>
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price<br/>
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"<br/>
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and<br/>
let her introduce you 'round town like her man<br/>
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent<br/>
then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up<br/>
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit<br/>
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them<br/>
Still there Brooklyn?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shorty]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars<br/>

<i>[Beans]</i> 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy<br/>
<i>[Chris]</i> Whassup Sig? This Chris out the Young Guns dog<br/>
<i>[Beans]</i> Whattup?<br/>
<i>[Chris]</i> I'm ready to smash these niggaz in the rap game<br/>
The niggaz takin too long with that advance money and shit<br/>
<i>[Beans]</i> Yeah<br/>
<i>[Chris]</i> Talkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills<br/>
<i>[Beans]</i> Yeah I feel that<br/>
<i>[Chris]</i> I know you well connected dog<br/>
Let me holla at somebody real<br/>
<i>[Beans]</i> Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on<br/>
Bleek, line two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word<br/>
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd<br/>
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first<br/>
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first<br/>
You new in town, no red and blue in town, there's gangs<br/>
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change<br/>
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots<br/>
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired<br/>
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish<br/>
and other niggaz who gettin it - DEAD IT<br/>
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse<br/>
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved<br/>
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it<br/>
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic<br/>
900-Hustler, you pass it around<br/>
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out<br/>

<i>[Beans]</i> 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog<br/>
What seem to be the problem young boy?<br/>
<i>[MDKHN]</i> Yo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga<br/>
(??) I got two freaks<br/>
<i>[Beans]</i> Yo watch your fuckin mouth man<br/>
<i>[MDKHN]</i> Fuck you mean watch my mouth nigga?<br/>
Been on hold for about two hours nigga<br/>
<i>[Beans]</i> I don't give a fuck how long you been on the line;<br/>
shut the fuck up! Matter of fact, hold on<br/>
<i>[click, classical type music plays]</i><br/>
<i>[MDKHN]</i> I know this nigga ain't just put.. put me on hold man<br/>
This bullshit-ass elevator music<br/>
<i>[Beans]</i> Free, pick up line five<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Free]</i><br/>
First things first, watch what you say out your mouth<br/>
when you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers<br/>
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch<br/>
when you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers<br/>
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out<br/>
if a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya<br/>
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state<br/>
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (hoe!)<br/>
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)<br/>
You stoppin dough when we clutchin the gats?<br/>
I know you heard "Friend or Foe," this ain't different from that<br/>
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like<br/>
Young, Jon Benet doin a mission tonight and yo<br/>
until you up stay away from them dice and whores<br/>
Three smuts, two streaks and a dyke<br/>
can pause one-three rumbles two streaks and a pipe for sure<br/>
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more<br/>
Nine and four, everyday back and forth<br/>
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler<br/>
Pass the number til you're stackin balls<br/>
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more<br/>
I take cash or write the check out to F-R<br/>
two E's, that'll be two G's<br/>
And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga<br/>
