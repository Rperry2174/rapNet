It’s like this yo, and we don’t stop!<br/>
Jay-Z<br/>
Check it<br/>
I get deep and dark like ditches<br/>
But when I rap I come off like that without the glitches<br/>
Never crossed the black cat with the riches<br/>
I’m leaving Stevie sayin’ no Wonder you’re superstitious!<br/>
Beef, I’m with it, simple, ya’ll can all get it<br/>
Ya’ll don’t all get it<br/>
Don’t nobody of mind for this matter<br/>
Can gather the data until ya mind don’t matter!<br/>
I bubble like lather, hustle like the lead-off batter?<br/>
Cause all that matters is the money, ‘till it ain’t funny!<br/>
You feel me? When the beast screams kill me<br/>
Don’t jerk me boy, I rip it silly!<br/>
I’ll let you rise of course, but if you don’t fall off on your own<br/>
Emcee’s I cut off at the knees like shorts<br/>
It gets worst! If you don’t care for my sick thoughts like a nurse!<br/>
With no known remedy, I’m leaving boys and men on bended knee till the end of the road<br/>
I lie low, forget this record shit, with one sale…<br/>
<br/>
Check it out!<br/>
The nerve of these herbs<br/>
Ya’ll know which swerve from the curb in the LAX<br/>
The best observe<br/>
I’m splashing, splurging, dashing that’s my word ya know<br/>
Champagne glass is crashing, can’t ration<br/>
Used to having a whole lot, so dough, I blow a lot<br/>
Had a buck fifty while you were still taking skibby to school<br/>
Ran with one of them cats that hides Tiffany’s for them jewels<br/>
Back when Duke was jumping out of cabs in Krush Groove<br/>
I was scheming and plotting mostly<br/>
Dreaming alive, but look what it got me!<br/>
Four cars and four hundred shots later<br/>
You know what I mean!
