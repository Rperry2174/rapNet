Uh-huh, yeah hah<br/>
Never sprung huh?<br/>
Jigga, Roc-a-Fella y'all<br/>
Never sprung huh?<br/>
Yeah, peep the repertoire<br/>
Peoples, feel me on this one<br/>
Peoples, feel this<br/>
Never sprung huh? Know my style<br/>
<br/>
I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches<br/>
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches<br/>
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches<br/>
Can't Knock your Hustle for real, exotic bitches<br/>
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum french<br/>
braids with the french name in the same night<br/>
Pull you and your tight friend<br/>
lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in<br/>
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R<br/>
Sexier than a Lexus car<br/>
Match wits with the best of y'all the rest of y'all<br/>
is like veg-etables in my presence, check it<br/>
Reminescin to nuttin you ever heard, Iceberg<br/>
Slim baby ride rims through the suburbs<br/>
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred<br/>
Get money like I'm down South Wednesday the 3rd, it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
Dough to get, more shows to rip<br/>
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit<br/>
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick<br/>
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit<br/>
<br/>
Can't scheme on em, Roc-a-Fella got a team on em<br/>
Chicks dream on him trick cream on him<br/>
Lose it when dudes think it's just music<br/>
Lean on em flash green on em and diamond rings on em<br/>
Sex around the way girls down to meet eyes<br/>
I'm somethin every girl gotta have like Levi's<br/>
Ya quita, me got more, see I ball<br/>
You can love me or hate me, either or<br/>
I'ma stay widdit, rock the custom drop Bentleys<br/>
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil Penny<br/>
can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave<br/>
just as quick, indian give, ha-hah<br/>
Now what I look like? Givin a chick half my trap<br/>
like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin that<br/>
you be the same chick when you leave me<br/>
the bankbook and the credit cards and take everything you came wit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You know the move's major, never minor<br/>
cause when you a true player, they never find ya<br/>
We takin trips abroad with chicks from afar<br/>
Down in the grill in the Villa gettin hilla<br/>
Never know em at the resort, readin to ride with us all<br/>
Checkin out this new wine, inhalin the cork<br/>
Million miles from the puddles the rainy days the tussles<br/>
Reign in ways to hustle, so we won't get caught<br/>
Had beef of all sort but I turned it around<br/>
Chose my steps more wisely, I'm learnin the ground<br/>
I was so gung-ho when I earned my first pound<br/>
Now it's million dollar deals, straight turnin em down<br/>
Roc-a-Fella make or break me, til death do us<br/>
Won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us<br/>
Been there, when I was in my tenth year, went there<br/>
Then I realized that it didn't make sense there<br/>
Backtrack, show me where the cash at, and plus<br/>
frivilous beef, please, we lookin past that<br/>
Y'all can gossip while we learnin the world<br/>
Drop the hot shit never returnin your girl, it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus (repeat 4X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Beyatch!<br/>
Jigga, nine-seven shit, next millenia<br/>
Recognize, realize, it's on<br/>
Roc the block, ahh<br/>
Laughin, it's on
