<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Rock on<br/>
Roc-A-Fella y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas]</i><br/>
Presidents to represent me<br/>
I'm out for Presidents to represent me <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I'm out for Dead Presidents to represent me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Well I was fit that wonderama shit<br/>
Me and my conglomerate<br/>
Shall remain anonymous<br/>
Caught up in the finest shit<br/>
Live out by dreams until my heart gives out<br/>
And while we crave you know exactly what the shit's about<br/>
Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen I dish out<br/>
Like the point-guard off your favorite team without doubt<br/>
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it<br/>
My mind was fine 'till the dough hit it<br/>
And told me that the mo' did it<br/>
And now it's closer shit and so I said it<br/>
I blow a digit on a dimin' in a minute but no bitchin'<br/>
Watch how I'm walkin' cause even the thoroughest niggas be knockin',<br/>
Tryin' to strike a bargain,<br/>
Hopin' that they might get pardoned<br/>
Shit on me boy we got me pins and needles<br/>
And my cerebral be's the wickedess evil<br/>
Thoughts that this boughter feed you<br/>
Feed back in a game so deep fien's can catch ya<br/>
Freeze off my knee cap can y'all believe that<br/>
Got the city drinkin' Crystal raise up the fee<br/>
Rappers going broke tryin' to keep up wit me<br/>
My rise the riches surprise the bitches<br/>
Think harder you know this nigga Jay-Z Shawn Carter<br/>
G.S. to fuck up, three years to fuck up<br/>
Watch me shine like a brightly be gets to fuck up<br/>
All rhymers forget like Alzheimer's<br/>
Small timers I said it<br/>
I'm addressing all drama torture<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas]</i><br/>
I'm out for Presidents to represent me <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I'm out for Dead Presidents to represent me<br/>
<i>[Repeat x1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
So sick of niggas<br/>
I want money like Cosby who wouldn't<br/>
It's this kind of talk that make me think<br/>
You probably ain't got no pudding<br/>
Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail<br/>
You in the streets nigga<br/>
Make your move get your get your mail<br/>
Niggas are coastin' the S.L. but can't post bail<br/>
Niggas are roast the L.<br/>
But scared to throw your toast well<br/>
I am here to tell niggas it ain't all swell<br/>
There's heaven then there's hell niggas<br/>
One day your cruisin' in ya seven<br/>
Next day your sweatin' forgetin' your lies<br/>
Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up<br/>
Hit with the rico, they repo your vehicle<br/>
Everything was all good just a week ago<br/>
Bout to start bitchin' ain't you<br/>
Ready to start snitchin' ain't you<br/>
I forgive your weak ass hustlin' just ain't you<br/>
Aside from the fast cars<br/>
Hunnies that shake they ass at bars<br/>
You know you wouldn't be involved<br/>
With the underworld dealers, carriers and mac-miller's<br/>
East-coast bodiers, west-coast cap peelers<br/>
Little monkey niggas turn gorilla's<br/>
Stopped in the station filled up on noctane<br/>
And now they not sane, and not playin'<br/>
That goes without sayin'<br/>
Slangin' day in and day out<br/>
With money playin' then they play you out<br/>
Tryin' to escape my own mind<br/>
Lurkin' the enemy representin' infinite<br/>
With presidencies you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas]</i><br/>
Dead Presidents to represent me <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I'm our for presidents to represent me <i>[x7]</i><br/>
I'm our for Dead Presidents to represent me
