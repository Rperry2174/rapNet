<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Only rapper to re-write history without a pen<br/>
No ID on the track let the story begin, begin, begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
This is anti autotune, death of the ringtone,<br/>
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing alongs<br/>
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde<br/>
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song<br/>
Wrong, this ain't politically correct<br/>
This might offend my political connects<br/>
My raps don't have melodies<br/>
This should make niggas wanna go and commit felonies<br/>
Get your chain tooken<br/>
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn<br/>
I know we facing a recession<br/>
But the music y'all making going make it the great depression<br/>
All y'all lack aggression<br/>
Put your skirt back down, grow a set man<br/>
Nigga this shit violent<br/>
This is death of autotune, moment of silence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This ain't a number one record<br/>
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon<br/>
I made it just for Flex and...<br/>
... Mister Cee, I want niggas to feel threatened<br/>
Stop your bloodclot crying<br/>
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying<br/>
You niggas' jeans too tight<br/>
You colors too bright, your voice too light<br/>
I might wear black for a year straight<br/>
I might bring back Versace shades<br/>
This ain't for z100<br/>
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 1 hundred<br/>
This is for Hot 97<br/>
This shit's for Clue, for Khaled, for we the best in<br/>
Nigga this shit violent<br/>
Death of autotune, moment of silence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
This shit need a verse from Jeezy<br/>
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy<br/>
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this<br/>
Give this to a blood, let a crip walk on it<br/>
Fifty thou' to style on this<br/>
I just don't need nobody to smile on this<br/>
You niggas singing too much<br/>
Get back to rap you t-paining too much<br/>
I'm a multi-millionaire<br/>
So how is it I'm still the hardest here<br/>
I don't be in the project hallway talking about how I be in the project all day<br/>
That sound stupid to me<br/>
If you a gangsta this is how you prove it to me<br/>
Nigga just get violent<br/>
This is death of autotune moment of silence
