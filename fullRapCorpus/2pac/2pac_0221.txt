<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Black Cotton<br/>
Black Cotton<br/>
Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle<br/>
Time for a little gospel tale<br/>
Ghetto gospel that is- listen<br/>
Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes<br/>
Speak<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Black Cotton<br/>
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessings<br/>
Class is in session: the worst question is the first question<br/>
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave<br/>
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')<br/>
Answer that then answer this too-<br/>
Love's gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true<br/>
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live<br/>
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?<br/>
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue<br/>
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)<br/>
Dum dum diddy is it me?<br/>
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets<br/>
If not peace then at least let's get a piece<br/>
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased<br/>
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook<br/>
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took<br/>
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF<br/>
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot<br/>
God come save the misbegotten<br/>
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(No matter how hard I try, look to the sky, and I ask God why)<br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(Seems like my dreams, drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)<br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(Feels like I'm pressed, why do I stress? It's like I'm being tested)<br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air, please answer my questions)<br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up<br/>
Running out of luck, about to self destruct<br/>
Old heads say live your life like such<br/>
You're sure to catch her witcha one day boy<br/>
I wouldn't listen to 'em<br/>
Your power movement was cool<br/>
But it ain't fix nothin'<br/>
So I just go with what i know<br/>
I don't trust none<br/>
Look what the 80s did<br/>
To us baby kids<br/>
And now we grown up<br/>
Nobody ain't own us yet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble:]</i><br/>
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me<br/>
I'm workin' without a profit<br/>
They shacklin' all my homies<br/>
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind<br/>
And we ain't stop, it's curtains, you try to rise and<br/>
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas<br/>
What's the reward for a struggler<br/>
If the lord loving us then why they hate to see us comin' up<br/>
Running up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves<br/>
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove<br/>
No love<br/>
Waitin' for my 40 acres and a blunt to blaze<br/>
Biblical times good hearts with milita minds<br/>
Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines<br/>
Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they giving me mine<br/>
Black Cotton<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(No matter how hard I try, look to the sky, and I ask God why)<br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(Seems like my dreams, drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)<br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(Feels like I'm pressed, why do I stress? It's like I'm being tested)<br/>
Nobody don't care<br/>
(Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air, please answer my questions)<br/>
Nobody don't care
