<i>[2Pac (singers):]</i><br/>
You a what? Bad Boy Killaz <br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Hahaha, yeah, nigga, fuck 'em all!<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Fuck all you muthafuckers!<br/>
Ayo, Biggie, put your hands up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Now, I can make it happen<br/>
My rappin' is similar to mothafuckers when they scrappin'<br/>
Blast and watch 'em back up<br/>
Notorious Biggie killer, affiliation with Death Row<br/>
Niggas get their caps pealed back, fool, this the West Coast<br/>
Bitch, you misdemeanor, I'm raisin' hell like felonies<br/>
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these <br/>
Intoxicated, we duplicated but never faded<br/>
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin' <br/>
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit<br/>
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick <br/>
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back<br/>
I wait for niggas to trip 'cause, bitch, I love to scrap<br/>
Mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas<br/>
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer <br/>
I went from rocks to zines, writin' raps and movies<br/>
I went from trustin' these tricks<br/>
Now they all want to sue me, so fuck 'em all!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble (singers):]</i><br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Come put your hands up in the air!<br/>
It's a middle finger affair, yeah<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kadafi:]</i> <br/>
Now, could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak?<br/>
Even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats<br/>
I'm addicted to these streets, like crack is to these creeps<br/>
Seein' visions of a prison, wake up screamin' in my sleep<br/>
Is there a heaven in this hell? A possibility of livin' well?<br/>
But if they killin' me, I get my stripes and whose to tell<br/>
Choosin' to sell, I'd rather die and be deceased<br/>
World mob figure addicted to these fuckin' streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I.:]</i><br/>
Now, put your muthafuckin' hands up if you's a rider (Ride)<br/>
Niggas ain't killers so they hidin' (Why?)<br/>
Fuck 'em all, touch 'em all; that's the way that we do it<br/>
Ride up, hop the fuck out, watch that bitch nigga lose it<br/>
Man, I'm as strong as this game, ya'll be knowin' my name<br/>
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain<br/>
Livin' my life in the fast lane, gettin' fucked by the past<br/>
Got my mind on my cash<br/>
And my next piece of ass, so fuck 'em all!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble (singers):]</i><br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Come put your hands up in the air!<br/>
It's a middle finger affair, yeah<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
I do my dirt all by my lonely<br/>
Don't need no phony homie to call me<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies<br/>
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Nigga, we Outlaw riders<br/>
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I got glad bags with enemies, cut up so they remember me<br/>
Soaked up in Hennessy, so they relatives know it's me<br/>
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick 'em and holla<br/>
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas<br/>
Jump up and get your ass shot up <br/>
For my profit pick my Glock up<br/>
I'm bustin' with self-defense, you see<br/>
Poppin' nobody got 'em, holla<br/>
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal<br/>
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal<br/>
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. team and the helicopters<br/>
Them crackers is crazy, why? 'Cause they'll never stop us<br/>
I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger bust somebody in a movie<br/>
Now I want to do it too, ooh, ooh<br/>
Niggas is too through, true to the game<br/>
I claim Outlaw riders, we give a fuck what they try, I'm…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble:]</i><br/>
'Cause Young Noble behind it<br/>
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain?<br/>
Kick back, lil' nigga, and watch the game<br/>
Get your mob rocked and what-not<br/>
We keep it poppin', like a drug spot<br/>
The streets know what's hot, trust me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
Even my hood call me "baby Malcolm X"<br/>
With the TEC's, shower some slugs on 'em<br/>
I've got a brother, don't rest and he keeps some drugs on him<br/>
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food<br/>
Ever seen Faces of Death? That's what my 9 do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
I keep my mind on my money, and my money on my mind<br/>
With my back against the wall, like I'm runnin' outta time<br/>
Even rap with a gat, I must be goin' out my mind<br/>
Like I'm up against the world, this guerrilla team of mine<br/>
Screamin', "Thug Life, bitch, fuck 'em all!" and die for 'em<br/>
Even if the last nigga left I'ma ride for 'em<br/>
Feel me? Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'<br/>
"Fuck 'em all, let them die!" – that's my slogan; fuck 'em all!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble (singers):]</i><br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Come put your hands up in the air!<br/>
It's a middle finger affair, yeah<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
I do my dirt all by my lonely<br/>
Don't need no phony homie to call me<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies<br/>
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
Nigga, we Outlaw riders<br/>
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)<br/>
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
