If my enemies love their kids<br/>
only if my enemies love their kids<br/>
If my enemies love their kids<br/>
If my enemies love their kids<br/>
only if my enemies love their kids<br/>
<br/>
Hey, why have drama<br/>
nigga, your baby mama stay right around the corner<br/>
I could touch her if I fucking wanna<br/>
so why you want insist on this<br/>
I got your name at the top of fucking dead bitch list<br/>
meet Mr Machiavelli’s terror<br/>
back of the year, thug of the era<br/>
death row and Outlawz, nobody does this shit better<br/>
my lyrics explode on contact<br/>
best prepare for combat<br/>
aint no stopping so bomb back<br/>
it’s the last days, nigga’s is dying for bullshit<br/>
Mac 11 is heavy, yeah I’m ready to pull quick<br/>
niggas aint ready for a brother thats living major<br/>
been waiting <i>[?]</i> muthafucker thats spittin’ razors,<br/>
when I cut em they cut, when I stick ‘em they stuck<br/>
my ambitions to bust, cause I aint giving a fuck<br/>
tore the neighbourhood up, look at all the shit that we did<br/>
murder’s a life long bitch<br/>
if my enemies love they kids<br/>
<br/>
You don’t wanna die<br/>
and I don’t wanna kill ya,<br/>
keep my name out ya mouth<br/>
‘fore a nigga have to drill ya<br/>
all my enemies buggin’ for all the shit that they did<br/>
don’t make me murder you nigga<br/>
if my enemy’s love their kids<br/>
<br/>
Body’s is wrapped in plastic<br/>
look at this, it’s drastic<br/>
takes a nigga with the right automatic to cause static<br/>
like a mosberg jumpin, and muthafucker’s be jumpin’<br/>
play the role of a bitch<br/>
like Michael Jackson, wanna be startin’ something<br/>
holla at my crew and they perish you through the cherish<br/>
got the <i>[?)]</i>in my sight<br/>
tonight I’m bussin’ off the terrace with multiple gun shots<br/>
niggas be droppin’ rapidly, bussin’ clip to cops<br/>
and bitches running after me tellin I’m high<br/>
when they ask why I’m trippin’ out<br/>
top of my drop, cause you know why, keep dippin’ on my block<br/>
they sell rocks on box with frail cops<br/>
and then we buss shots from glocks, fuck cops<br/>
my only fear of death, can you hear me, it’s coming back<br/>
had enough of this bullshit world so none of that<br/>
I felt no remorse for all the shit that we did<br/>
niggas die at any time if my enemy’s love their kids<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You muthafucking right<br/>
you niggas better wise up<br/>
it’s a real muthafucking war nigga<br/>
you wanna get with me<br/>
how the fuck you gon get with me<br/>
if you got kids muthafucker<br/>
if my enemies love they kids<br/>
I’ma let my lil homeboys ride on you busta muthafuckers<br/>
cause y’all dont feel me<br/>
<br/>
I don’t even wanna talk no more<br/>
losing your life, what for?<br/>
facing a young muthafucker who puts it down for the dough<br/>
get killed in front of your kids<br/>
God forbid if it happens<br/>
that’s the shit I’m on now <i>[?]</i><br/>
gotta survive by myself<br/>
but at the same time they rappin’<br/>
wont put my gun on the shelf,<br/>
it keeps me living like heaven<br/>
but when the shit jumps I’m ready<br/>
cause I already knew<br/>
you better get this muthafucker before we come get you<br/>
deep in my heart I think this shits bout to pop any moment<br/>
tryna do me like my parents but I’m a tougher opponent<br/>
<br/>
This nigga scared<br/>
Must investigate all I’m prepared<br/>
for all the drama, you said<br/>
for all them niggas you feared<br/>
you fucking busta, busta<br/>
Let the evil or the money trap you and thats life at you<br/>
every second we coming at you<br/>
and you the last one<br/>
When L-rock is trying cast on ya<br/>
Cuz a Young Rida who would die,<br/>
pump up and blast on the thug past you<br/>
Blastin on enemies passing<br/>
giggling when they should have been figuring who would be the last one, laughing while I switch your wig<br/>
I gotta ask ya’ll something<br/>
don’t you muthafuckers got kids
