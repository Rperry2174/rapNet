<i>[Press release:]</i><br/>
In today's music news: The ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli".<br/>
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.<br/>
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.<br/>
Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac—excuse me–Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers.<br/>
Jay Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.<br/>
The question everybody wants to know is:<br/>
Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac–rather Makaveli–was not available for comment, but released this statement:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac talking:]</i><br/>
It's not about East or West<br/>
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money, riders and punks – which side are you on?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[*gunshots followed by several encroaching footsteps*]</i><br/>
<br/>
These niggas is still fucking talking?<br/>
You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight<br/>
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches<br/>
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)<br/>
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)<br/>
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo Shit, Bring it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don<br/>
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an<br/>
Niggas get shook like 5-0<br/>
My .45 is next to me when we ride for survival<br/>
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets<br/>
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it<br/>
Expose snakes 'cause they breed freely<br/>
See me ride! Located worldwide like the art of graffiti<br/>
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty<br/>
Born on a dope fiend's titty<br/>
In every city you'll find me<br/>
Look for trouble right behind me<br/>
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me<br/>
Know what I mean? I hit the scene<br/>
Niggas ducking from my guillotine stare<br/>
I'm right there, my every word a fucking nightmare<br/>
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall<br/>
This for my dogs down to die for y'all<br/>
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em<br/>
Cut 'em down, to hell is where we send 'em<br/>
My whole team; trained to explode, ride or die<br/>
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry<br/>
Me; a born leader, never leave the block without my heater<br/>
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"<br/>
And not a whimper until I'm gone<br/>
Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong<br/>
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride<br/>
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry<br/>
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too<br/>
Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you<br/>
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe<br/>
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay<br/>
West Coast rider, coming right behind ya<br/>
Should have never fucked with me<br/>
I want money, hoes, sex and weed<br/>
I won't rest until my road dog's free; bomb first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
We bomb first when we ride<br/>
Please, reconsider before you die<br/>
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight<br/>
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first<br/>
We bomb first when we ride<br/>
Please reconsider before you die<br/>
We ain't even come to fight tonight<br/>
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I. Mean:]</i><br/>
For so many days, in so many ways<br/>
We've been ducking strays they delivers<br/>
But still we some Bad Boy killers<br/>
Got nothing to lose, I gots nowhere to go<br/>
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row<br/>
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general<br/>
And I be a soldier on a mission<br/>
Sent to do what you'll never do<br/>
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause<br/>
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch<br/>
Yo, I'm dying with yours<br/>
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi<br/>
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"<br/>
If you ain't in this rap game<br/>
For the motherfucking cash, mane<br/>
Then what is your motherfucking purpose?<br/>
Non can serve us<br/>
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless<br/>
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!<br/>
Then we ride<br/>
Come on, bring it<br/>
Bomb first then we ride<br/>
Hey, get that nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble:]</i><br/>
Your style wack as ever, like you was rocking patent leather<br/>
Causing massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough<br/>
Half rapper, half drug kingpin<br/>
You're telling fairy tales, dunn<br/>
"King of New York" like you the motherfucking one?<br/>
But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit<br/>
From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flippin' chips, gettin' rich, even though it's hard<br/>
Trying to creep through these halls and brawls<br/>
Without scarred by a revolve<br/>
With no warning signs, 'cause yo, my man took five<br/>
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding<br/>
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me<br/>
We bomb first when we ride<br/>
Please reconsider 'fore you die<br/>
G's and thug niggas on the rise<br/>
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first<br/>
We bomb first when we ride<br/>
Please reconsider 'fore you die<br/>
G's and thug niggas on the rise<br/>
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Start of "Hail Mary"]</i><br/>
Let us pray, my niggas<br/>
For we have definitely sinned
