<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side<br/>
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die<br/>
And even though we both came from the same places<br/>
The money and the fame made us all change places<br/>
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass<br/>
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask<br/>
For currency, but you could run to me when you need<br/>
And I'll never leave, honestly<br/>
Someone to believe in, as you can see<br/>
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?<br/>
Real homies help you get through<br/>
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could<br/>
'Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good<br/>
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops<br/>
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block<br/>
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change<br/>
I tell her "Yeah," but it's clear<br/>
I'll always be the same; until the end of time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R.L. Huggar:]</i><br/>
So take these broken wings<br/>
I need your hands to come and heal me once again<br/>
(Until the end of time)<br/>
So I can fly away, until the end of time<br/>
Until the end of time, until the end of time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin<br/>
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids<br/>
So you know, I don't hang around the house much<br/>
This all night money making got me outta touch<br/>
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while<br/>
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs<br/>
My attitude got me walking solo<br/>
Ride out alone in my lo-lo<br/>
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo<br/>
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean<br/>
Smoking 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'<br/>
Who can I trust in this cold world?<br/>
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl<br/>
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him<br/>
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican<br/>
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen<br/>
Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'<br/>
Until the end of timeâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R.L. Huggar:]</i><br/>
So take these broken wings<br/>
I need your hands to come and heal me once again<br/>
(Until the end of time)<br/>
So I can fly away, until the end of time<br/>
Until the end of time, until the end of time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong<br/>
To live my life as an outlaw all along?<br/>
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters<br/>
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators<br/>
And in the end, drinking Hennessy<br/>
Made all my enemies envy me<br/>
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily<br/>
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe<br/>
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)<br/>
When I conceive closer to achieve<br/>
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G<br/>
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need<br/>
An ounce of game and the training to make a g<br/>
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw<br/>
Another album out, that's what I'm about, more<br/>
Getting raw 'til the day I see my casket, buried as a G<br/>
While the whole world remembers me, until the end of time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R.L. Huggar:]</i><br/>
So take these broken wings<br/>
I need your hands to come and heal me once again<br/>
(until the end of time)<br/>
So I can fly away, until the end of time<br/>
Until the end of time, until the end of time
