<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
(Ol' switcheroo-ass, bitch made motherfuckers, just be friends)<br/>
Outlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up<br/>
Hahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turning on me?<br/>
Why me? Westside, how you do it boy?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fall<br/>
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ballin'<br/>
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny<br/>
Got a lot of love for, any niggas gettin' money<br/>
I made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped<br/>
It was hip-hop until 2Pac fucked Biggie bitch<br/>
Y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made<br/>
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid<br/>
Have me catchin' cases all across the nation<br/>
I went from jail to bail to barely on probation<br/>
They got a player facin' three strikes<br/>
And we might, just blast God bless the child, that can get cash<br/>
But all these niggas turnin' and never learn<br/>
Got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin' burned<br/>
Talk a lot of shit but you's a trick in drag<br/>
Like the MAC make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back stab<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singers &amp; 2Pac:]</i><br/>
Why you wanna turn on me?<br/>
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)<br/>
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)<br/>
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)<br/>
Why you wanna turn on me?<br/>
Never thought you would backstab me<br/>
When you niggas see me you flee (yeah nigga)<br/>
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
It, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct<br/>
Although two juvenile delinquents, we still decent<br/>
Playin' catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs<br/>
Fuck school we was skippin' drink a fifth on the curb<br/>
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin' brew<br/>
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga<br/>
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes<br/>
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door<br/>
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye<br/>
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?<br/>
I never got a single visit yet I carry on<br/>
All my old friends too busy now my money gone<br/>
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? <i>[*laughter*]</i><br/>
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat<br/>
Fuck Wendy Williams and I pray you choke<br/>
On the next dick down your throat<br/>
For turnin' on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singers &amp; 2Pac:]</i><br/>
Why you wanna turn on me?<br/>
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)<br/>
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)<br/>
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)<br/>
Why you wanna turn on me?<br/>
Never thought you would backstab me<br/>
When you niggas see me you flee<br/>
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll<br/>
Anybody ever seen Wendy Williams fat ass?<br/>
Why you always wearin' Spandex you fat bitch?<br/>
I know your pussy stinks, you fat ho<br/>
I'm puttin' Jenny Craig on you bitch<br/>
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit<br/>
Through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass<br/>
And put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!<br/>
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch<br/>
It's 2Pac so you know who said it<br/>
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick<br/>
And Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!<br/>
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about<br/>
He shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin' ring<br/>
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out<br/>
He don't step in the fuckin' ring, that's how the shit go<br/>
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!<br/>
Well that's what 2Pac gon' do<br/>
When niggas come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!<br/>
One way or the motherfuckin' other<br/>
This old motherfuckin' nigga in the South told me nigga<br/>
It's more than one way to skin a cat<br/>
It's more than one way to shoot a gat<br/>
It's more than one way to die nigga<br/>
When I'm through, everybody cry nigga<br/>
This is how we do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singers &amp; 2Pac:]</i><br/>
Why you wanna turn on me?<br/>
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)<br/>
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)<br/>
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G..<br/>
Why you wanna turn on me?<br/>
Never thought you would backstab me<br/>
When you niggas see me you flee<br/>
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G<br/>
(Fuck you too nigga!)
