<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Hehehe, yeah<br/>
These are my words to my firstborn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Can you picture young niggas in a rush to grow?<br/>
'Til hard-timers in the pen' had to crush his throat<br/>
Probably never even saw it comin'<br/>
Too busy bullshittin', caught him with his mouth runnin'<br/>
Ain't this a bitch? They got me twisted in this game<br/>
The feds and the punk police pointin' pistols at my brain<br/>
I wonder if I'm wrong 'cause I'm thugged out<br/>
My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house<br/>
What was supposed to be a easy hit<br/>
Now shit is flipped, 'cause niggas died over bullshit<br/>
It's not my dream, I'm seein' pictures of a broken man<br/>
No witnesses only the questions of who smoked the man<br/>
Young adolescents in our prime live a life of crime<br/>
Though it ain't logical, we hobble through these tryin' times<br/>
Livin' blind—Lord, help me with my troubled soul<br/>
Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?<br/>
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer<br/>
One love to the thugs in Heaven, I'll see you there<br/>
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned<br/>
Help you make it through the storm<br/>
My words to my firstborn—feel me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
My words to my firstborn<br/>
My words to my firstborn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed<br/>
So, I knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse<br/>
And though it hurt me, there was no distortion<br/>
'Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions<br/>
Quiet your soul, 'cause you know what you had to do<br/>
And so did victims of a world they never came to<br/>
I understand it's a better day comin', sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end, drivin' with the car runnin'<br/>
Blinded, ain't no love in the hood, only hearts torn<br/>
Love letters to the innocent and unborn<br/>
All the babies that died up on the table<br/>
Wasn't able to breathe, 'cause the family wasn't able<br/>
Can't blame her, I would do the same<br/>
All I could give her was my debt and my last name<br/>
'Cause in the game things change, livin' up and down<br/>
This hard life got me walkin' with my head down<br/>
Flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?<br/>
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on<br/>
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born<br/>
My words to my firstborn—feel me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
My words to my firstborn<br/>
Mmm! (Yeah)<br/>
These are the words to my firstborn<br/>
Hey, nigga, talk to your born!<br/>
Talk to your seed, nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Above the Law:]</i><br/>
Two thousand somethin' somethin' mention a new era<br/>
A nigga's too real, now see shit too clear<br/>
See, there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt<br/>
(What else is it, dawg?) – the velvet and the silk<br/>
And makin' sure my kittens got they milk<br/>
(Hoo!) Gotta fill this mattress<br/>
Let my kids know I'm at this<br/>
Attack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll<br/>
Ain't no question, is it? Above the Law hustlers<br/>
If it's related to chips, homie, we'll handle ya<br/>
<br/>
Yo, although we never take advantage<br/>
Though we always into ery'thang<br/>
By all means, stack green, gangsta lean<br/>
They say money make the world go 'round<br/>
So, only associate yourself<br/>
With paper chasers and niggas that's truly down<br/>
And keep God first<br/>
And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts<br/>
It's player haters every corner you hit<br/>
Touchin' their tits, hella thick, tryin' to get you for yo' grip<br/>
I know you stressed-out and fed-up<br/>
But come out, gun-blazin', and keep yo' head up<br/>
You can call it what you want to, but it ain't gon' change<br/>
Above the Law, 2Pac, O.G.'s in this rap game<br/>
And we done lived a long hard life<br/>
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights<br/>
Y'all, although we grew up corrupted and scorned<br/>
We still got a lot of wisdom to give to our firstborn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
What you gon' tell your kids, nigga?<br/>
Who was you? What was you doin'?<br/>
How did you put it down?<br/>
These my words to my motherfuckin' firstborn<br/>
So, they can know, y'knahmean? Hehehe<br/>
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' rider<br/>
Westside 'til I die, that's all it was<br/>
It's a crooked-ass hand they deal a motherfucker<br/>
I just played to win, just played to win<br/>
Motherfucker gotta bet against the odds, y'knahmean?
