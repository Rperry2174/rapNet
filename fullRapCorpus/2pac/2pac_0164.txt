Here me and my closest road dogs<br/>
To my dog named Mussolini (you know it dog)<br/>
Big Syke (Westside)<br/>
Thug Life, baby (outlaw)<br/>
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it<br/>
Hahaha!<br/>
<br/>
Shit half the times we fought and caused trouble<br/>
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you<br/>
Fuck what they talkin' bout<br/>
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine<br/>
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind<br/>
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin' wild<br/>
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin' cases<br/>
Indeed, it was misery<br/>
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin' me<br/>
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?<br/>
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon<br/>
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right<br/>
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night<br/>
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer<br/>
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political<br/>
Runnin' from the future, escapin' in the fog<br/>
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz<br/>
<br/>
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk<br/>
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz<br/>
(me and my closest road dog)<br/>
All roam in the scary place called home<br/>
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz<br/>
Every ghetto street got a stop sign<br/>
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?<br/>
Even when I'm goin' through hard times<br/>
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine<br/>
<br/>
Haha.. bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga<br/>
They could never take the soul of a M.O.B. soldier nigga<br/>
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli<br/>
Boy you's a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me<br/>
Even if I died now<br/>
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?<br/>
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer<br/>
Ain't tryin' to hear it<br/>
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger<br/>
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared<br/>
M.O.B., 'til I die, when we ride niggas disappear<br/>
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke<br/>
Never forget to blow a hole in his head<br/>
For leakin' information to the feds<br/>
The burnin' bed was the tellin' sign<br/>
Two hired guns bustin' everyone, yellin' everybody die<br/>
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog<br/>
Bleedin' like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz<br/>
<br/>
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk<br/>
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz<br/>
(Bleedin' like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz)<br/>
All roam in the scary place called home<br/>
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz<br/>
Every ghetto street got a stop sign<br/>
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?<br/>
Even when I'm goin' through hard times<br/>
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine<br/>
<br/>
Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin'<br/>
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin'<br/>
See me in physical form, my niggas swarm<br/>
Take the figure of a circle beatin' jealous niggas 'til they purple<br/>
Simon Says take they heads homies<br/>
and send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies<br/>
Fishin' for fake niggas, observe and shake niggas<br/>
The only way to see six figures, is break niggas<br/>
Me and Mussolini set to ride we high<br/>
Big Bogart got the alibi,homicide ask us why<br/>
Labeled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe<br/>
To live and die as a millionaire, on ..<br/>
Set to explode, my M.O., is kill them hoes<br/>
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes<br/>
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog<br/>
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz<br/>
<br/>
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk<br/>
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz<br/>
(my closest road dogz)<br/>
All roam in the scary place called home<br/>
Take a second victim and if they all gone, (my closest road dogz)<br/>
Every ghetto street got a stop sign<br/>
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?<br/>
Even when I'm goin' through hard times<br/>
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine<br/>
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk<br/>
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz<br/>
All roam in the scary place called home<br/>
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz<br/>
Every ghetto street got a stop sign<br/>
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?<br/>
Even when I'm goin' through hard times<br/>
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine
