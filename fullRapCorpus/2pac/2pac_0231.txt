Nigga fuck that gin and juice, I'm fuckin' with Hennessy<br/>
Just pour me a glass of that dark shit<br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy) hahaha, yeah<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Now I was born in the gutter facing life or death<br/>
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath<br/>
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I<br/>
To try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggas fry<br/>
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessy<br/>
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed<br/>
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me<br/>
Now that it's popping ain't no love bitch<br/>
I maintain in the game in the gutter's where I still kick it<br/>
I'm trying to hustle up a meal ticket<br/>
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dying days<br/>
Ain't nuttin wrong with getting paid, so nigga blaze<br/>
Cause we some motherfuckin' fools<br/>
Walking through the streets wearing jewels, breaking niggas making moves<br/>
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip<br/>
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy) hahaha, yeah<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Edi Amin:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Up late nights (c'mon) under the city lights<br/>
The Henn got me feeling right, I'm trying to keep from swerving<br/>
She's so fine and she love Henn too<br/>
After a couple of shots she said, "I could do what I wanna do."<br/>
(That's right) We ain't sipping champagne (nah) we off the Henn-Rock<br/>
Alcoholics back at the liquor sto' cause we can't stop (can't stop)<br/>
And won't stop (we won't stop) all night long<br/>
'til the break of dawn, getting it on, Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i><br/>
Oh, lady watching (lady watching) as I'm gliding by (gliding by)<br/>
And the place is jumping that I can't deny (no, no, no)<br/>
Ooh I can't wait to go in, throw my glass in the sky (glass in the sky)<br/>
For the people partying, 'til the morning light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy) hahaha, yeah<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this ol' thug shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy) hahaha, yeah<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i> Oh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hennessy (Hennessy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown:]</i><br/>
We keep on sipping, and sipping, and sipping<br/>
Keep on sipping, and sipping, and sipping, ba-ba, ba-ba-dahhhhh, Hennessy
