Good Evening.<br/>
<i>[*sirens in the background*]</i><br/>
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard where many excited fans have gathered with candles <i>[*crowd starts chanting "2Pac"*]</i> awaiting the much anticipated release, of 2Pac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz.<br/>
This is yet another post-humous release by 2Pac which, raises the question <br/>
"Where are these songs coming from?" <br/>
It's interesting how the message in these songs is still relevant today.<br/>
Even in his death he's touching people with his lyrics.<br/>
I can feel the energy in the air as they count down to midnight when the album will officially be released.<br/>
Oh, hold on. I think they're starting to countdown now.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Crowd:]</i><br/>
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
