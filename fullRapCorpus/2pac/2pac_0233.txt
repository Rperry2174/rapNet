<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?<br/>
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me<br/>
Now, it's getting crazy after dark, these NARC's<br/>
Be like trying to shut me down but I'm too smart<br/>
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary<br/>
I've been moving these things since the days of elementary<br/>
Now tell me what you need when you see me<br/>
I'm stacking G's, buying all the things on TV, believe me<br/>
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know<br/>
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low<br/>
Although I'm young, I'm still coming up<br/>
I'm getting paid, pulling razors on niggas when they running up<br/>
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?<br/>
I've been slicing motherfuckers since I lost my mama<br/>
There ain't a cop that can stop me<br/>
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me<br/>
I'm loyal to the game<br/>
<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Told life you'd be back" "There you were"<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Everybody look around" "There is no hope"<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Brothers we better get hip"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Syke:]</i><br/>
My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood<br/>
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood<br/>
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block<br/>
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock<br/>
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy<br/>
And I'm steady catching static, move the traffic to the alley<br/>
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil<br/>
Mix the work with baking soda and get the water to boil<br/>
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne<br/>
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game<br/>
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain<br/>
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game<br/>
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes<br/>
When they yelling that he telling get to me, no surprise, nigga<br/>
<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Told life you'd be back" "There you were"<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Everybody look around" "There is no hope"<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Brothers we better get hip"<br/>
<br/>
"And come off this trip"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Quik:]</i><br/>
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me<br/>
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption<br/>
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and<br/>
Enemies in my family extorting scheming and scamming me (pop pop)<br/>
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me<br/>
I'm battered and bruised, and madder having to choose<br/>
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be filling my shoes<br/>
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose<br/>
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool<br/>
Y'all rapping I'm talking cool, and Columbine is not new<br/>
In Compton they shoot up schools too, riding by to see who's who<br/>
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through<br/>
Tell his family that dude's blue, no coming back<br/>
From him scrapping when niggas was packing and he wasn't packing too<br/>
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow<br/>
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em<br/>
<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Told life you'd be back" "There you were"<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
"Everybody look around" "There is no hope"<br/>
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"<br/>
<br/>
"Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat<br/>
If this shit don't STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!"
