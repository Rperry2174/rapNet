<i>[Daz Dillinger:]</i><br/>
You find an MC like me who's strong<br/>
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support<br/>
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though<br/>
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those<br/>
Who can withstand the more power I gain<br/>
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain<br/>
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star<br/>
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are<br/>
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded<br/>
Would it be the greatest MC of all time when I created rhyme<br/>
For the simple fact, when I attack, I crush your pride<br/>
My intention to ride, every time on lye<br/>
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar<br/>
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride<br/>
Breakin' in gas with the '68 all day<br/>
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation<br/>
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'<br/>
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication<br/>
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations<br/>
Sorry I left that ass waitin'<br/>
No more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shakin'<br/>
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic<br/>
Don't take your life for granted<br/>
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted<br/>
My lyrics motivate the planet<br/>
It's similar to Rhythm Nation, but thugged out, forgive me, Janet<br/>
Who's in control, I'm activatin' your souls<br/>
You know the way the games get controlled<br/>
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine<br/>
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind<br/>
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote<br/>
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Method Man:]</i><br/>
I got my mind made up, come on<br/>
Get in, get into<br/>
Let it ride, tonight's the night<br/>
I got my mind made up, come on<br/>
Get in, get into<br/>
Let it ride, tonight's the night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
Well I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylactics<br/>
For protection so my fuckin' sac won't collapse<br/>
Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays<br/>
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave<br/>
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MC's<br/>
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra<br/>
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much<br/>
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch<br/>
I'm an, MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay<br/>
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei<br/>
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind<br/>
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm<br/>
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'<br/>
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin''<br/>
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain<br/>
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'<br/>
Why is that? Cause smilin' faces deceive<br/>
You best believe: to MC's, I'm the deadliest disease<br/>
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe<br/>
Your whole camp's under siege and I'm Jason Voorhees<br/>
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics<br/>
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site<br/>
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all<br/>
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall<br/>
You already have an idea about the superior sphere<br/>
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator<br/>
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back<br/>
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps<br/>
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact<br/>
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Method Man:]</i><br/>
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks, I makes manoeuvres<br/>
Like Hitler, stickin' up Jews with German Lugers<br/>
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle<br/>
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial<br/>
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice<br/>
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow<br/>
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan<br/>
Half of my Clan's repeat felons<br/>
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel<br/>
Man, I stay on point like icicles<br/>
Now who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical<br/>
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth<br/>
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie<br/>
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me<br/>
Better take one and pass or that's that ass<br/>
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast<br/>
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash<br/>
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman:]</i><br/>
Lyrical gats spittin' the criminal tactics<br/>
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards<br/>
Let's face it, there's no replacement<br/>
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with<br/>
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted<br/>
Funk Doctor who, Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted<br/>
I got connects like Federal Express<br/>
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch<br/>
Got the clear spot from the rear block<br/>
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not<br/>
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop<br/>
Since your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked<br/>
Whiff this underground cannabis<br/>
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst<br/>
Flip MC's like ki's<br/>
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's<br/>
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake<br/>
So I erase the whole front row at the wake<br/>
I planned my escape in case Jake wann' snake bust it<br/>
I'm the one pushin' the hearse in the first place<br/>
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks<br/>
Pump for Rockafeller for the day he got smoked<br/>
Choke off this antidote, got you ope<br/>
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt<br/>
And I'm out for 9-nickel<br/>
<br/>
