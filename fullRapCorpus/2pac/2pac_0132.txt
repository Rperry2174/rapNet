Hey Suge, what I tell you, nigga<br/>
When I come out of jail, what was I gonna do?<br/>
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right<br/>
Watch this<br/>
Hey Quik, let me get them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars<br/>
Hahahaha, yeah nigga, time to ride<br/>
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga<br/>
Cause it's gonna be a long one<br/>
Now me and Quik finna show you niggas what it's like on this side - the real side<br/>
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers<br/>
And there's gonna be some pussies<br/>
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches<br/>
The pussies are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'<br/>
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky<br/>
See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends, but in real life they your enemies<br/>
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies<br/>
But in real life they eyes is on your money<br/>
See, the enemies will say they true<br/>
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches<br/>
It's a dirty game, y'all<br/>
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with<br/>
Cause the shit get wild, y'all<br/>
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby<br/>
Keep your mind on your riches<br/>
<br/>
9-1-1! It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me<br/>
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me<br/>
Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed<br/>
Nothing more I despise than a liar<br/>
Cowards die<br/>
My mama told me when I was a seed<br/>
Just a vicious motherfucker why these devils left me free<br/>
I proceed to make them shiver<br/>
When I deliver<br/>
Criminal lyrics<br/>
From a world wide mob figure<br/>
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli<br/>
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me<br/>
So many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw<br/>
Switching up on you ordinary bitches<br/>
Like a southpaw you get left<br/>
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased<br/>
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'<br/>
I rip the crowd, then I start again<br/>
Eternally I live in sin<br/>
Until the moment that they let me breathe again<br/>
The heartz of men<br/>
<br/>
The hearts of men<br/>
<br/>
My lyrical verse was so much pain, to some niggas it hurts<br/>
My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse<br/>
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll<br/>
In fly mode<br/>
I'm a homicidal outlaw<br/>
And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on<br/>
Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight<br/>
So we might roll<br/>
My own homies say I'm heartless<br/>
But I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless<br/>
Ride by, niggas bow down<br/>
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now<br/>
Throw up your hands if you thugged out<br/>
First nigga act up<br/>
First nigga getting drugged out<br/>
I can be a villain if ya let me<br/>
But motherfucker if ya do upset me<br/>
Tell the cops to come and get me<br/>
Rip the crowd like a phone number<br/>
Then start again, don't have no mutherfuckin' friends, nigga<br/>
Look inside the hearts of men<br/>
<br/>
In the hearts of men<br/>
<br/>
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states<br/>
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch<br/>
No longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand<br/>
Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man<br/>
Give me my money and label me as a don<br/>
If niggas is having problems<br/>
Smoke' em, fire and bomb<br/>
I died and came back<br/>
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack<br/>
Thugging is in my spirit<br/>
I'm lost and not knowing<br/>
Scared up, but still flowing<br/>
Energized and still going<br/>
Uh, can it be fate<br/>
That makes a sick motherfucker break<br/>
On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake<br/>
What will it take ?<br/>
Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb<br/>
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed<br/>
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again<br/>
Represent<br/>
Cause I've been sent<br/>
The hearts of men
