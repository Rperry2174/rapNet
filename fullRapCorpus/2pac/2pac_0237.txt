<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Wassup, boo? Yeah<br/>
Hahahaha, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2pac:]</i> <br/>
Another shady mission<br/>
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision<br/>
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish<br/>
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses<br/>
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family<br/>
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?<br/>
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?<br/>
Though I don't know<br/>
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go<br/>
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken<br/>
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'<br/>
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven<br/>
I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause being here ain't livin'<br/>
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy<br/>
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies<br/>
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost<br/>
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyshia Cole:]</i><br/>
I wanna be the one who<br/>
Who you can depend on who<br/>
Who Be The One Who Be There <br/>
Through The Thick And Thin <br/>
Go by the water we will<br/>
Be there 'til the morning<br/>
We won't leave until the night<br/>
And we will be forever more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyshia Cole:]</i> <br/>
No one else can do what you do for me<br/>
Take me away from the pain I feel inside<br/>
And it's gonna be alright and it'll be OK<br/>
If We Try And Take Our Time <br/>
Yes, baby, take our time<br/>
And we'll grow, trust I know<br/>
I wanna be the one whoâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyshia Cole:]</i><br/>
I wanna be the one who<br/>
Who you can depend on who<br/>
Who be the one who be there<br/>
Through the thick and thin<br/>
Go by the water we will<br/>
Be there 'til the morning<br/>
We won't leave until the night<br/>
And we will be forever more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac (Keyshia Cole):]</i><br/>
You got to play your cards right on one (Oh, yeah)<br/>
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? (No, no, no)<br/>
If you be patient, and you take your time (Be patient, baby)<br/>
And you finesse it, 9 times out of 10 times (10)<br/>
Homeboy, you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed<br/>
But if you rush and you just be manhandlin'<br/>
Ha-ha (Hey, it takes a real man)<br/>
Your ass is going home tonight, ha-ha (Hey)<br/>
Play your cards right, nigga, take your time (Be the one)<br/>
Be patient (Be the one, hey)<br/>
Go slow, it's better that way, you ain't heard? (Yeah)<br/>
Ha-ha, play your cards right (Be the one, I wanna be the one)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyshia Cole:]</i><br/>
I wanna be the one who<br/>
Who you can depend on who<br/>
Who be the one who be there<br/>
Through the thick and thin<br/>
Go by the water we will<br/>
Be there 'til the morning<br/>
We won't leave until the night<br/>
And we will be forever more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac (Keyshia Cole):]</i><br/>
Take your time, man (Take your time)<br/>
Don't be in such a rush (In a rush)<br/>
Ha-ha (Be forever more)<br/>
You got to be patient, man, be patient<br/>
It ain't going nowhere one, ha-ha (Nowhere)<br/>
Get some champagne (Ha-ha, be forever more)<br/>
Bring some roses or somethin', you know<br/>
Play some soft shit, light a fire (Luther Vandross)<br/>
You got to be cool with it (Teddy, Teddy)<br/>
You got to be slow with it (Oh, be so)<br/>
You got to be patient, you got to play your cards right on one<br/>
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'?<br/>
If you be patient, and you take you time and you finesse it
