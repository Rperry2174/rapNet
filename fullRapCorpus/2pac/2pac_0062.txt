Aight, new drink<br/>
One part Alizé, one part Cristal<br/>
Thug passion, baby<br/>
y'all know what time it is<br/>
This drink is Guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard<br/>
Now, if you with me<br/>
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, knowhatimean?<br/>
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols - alcoholics<br/>
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs<br/>
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
Mayne! I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant<br/>
But I'm a straight soldier, I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent<br/>
Trippin' over dead presidents<br/>
they got these derelicts<br/>
I throw was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent<br/>
And so rather, than stand forever<br/>
Been thinkin' drinkin' over a felony<br/>
And hell of me<br/>
And how it will be in hella shit, people tellin' me to cool out<br/>
But they ain't feelin' me, a motherfuckin' fool, about<br/>
My fuckin' cheddar cheese<br/>
and it pleases, passion of mine<br/>
Thuggin', huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while I pass through times<br/>
And all these bastards be watchin' just keep it plain<br/>
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game<br/>
I can, pinkle with the rain twinklin'<br/>
Diamonds and things go blinkin'<br/>
Enough to hold me, 'til I'm, old and wrinklin'<br/>
and These adversaries<br/>
They gonna have to be worryin'<br/>
Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion<br/>
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jewell:]</i><br/>
I heard it's the bomb<br/>
And you got it goin' on<br/>
Give me some of your thug passion, baby<br/>
You got me drippin' wet<br/>
from the way you make me sweat<br/>
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
Now what if me<br/>
Turn this Hennessy into a robbery<br/>
The Prophecy probably suddenly switch and how it supposed to be<br/>
And Dirty money<br/>
Can't be evil cause it's fillin' up my tummy<br/>
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic<br/>
Twistin' riches, but there is only one way to make more<br/>
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow<br/>
And my bigger bro, couldn't know<br/>
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more<br/>
with a Thug Passion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I. Mean:]</i><br/>
Puttin' down mashin', control by this thug's passion<br/>
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'<br/>
I'm askin', what happened<br/>
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to<br/>
That's what money and fame do, see they ain't true<br/>
Travelin' this road my poor soul has been consolidated<br/>
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated<br/>
How I made it, can be easily stated<br/>
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion, left me to fuckin' greatest<br/>
Load up and take shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Yaki Kadafi:]</i><br/>
Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit<br/>
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Storm:]</i><br/>
Creep with me, through that immortal flow<br/>
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row<br/>
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve<br/>
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb<br/>
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest<br/>
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest<br/>
You need a dub to get you flowin'<br/>
and let that loc see smoke<br/>
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jewell:]</i><br/>
I heard it's the bomb<br/>
And you got it goin' on<br/>
Give me some of your thug passion, baby<br/>
You got me drippin' wet<br/>
From the way you make me sweat<br/>
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!<br/>
<br/>
They say money don't make the man<br/>
But damn, I'm makin' money<br/>
Observin' you motherfuckers, 'cause some of you bitches funny<br/>
Say you want it but you bullshittin'<br/>
Lickin' them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick<br/>
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal, meanwhile<br/>
Buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me, she smiles; a niggas full of passion<br/>
Satisfaction is everlastin'<br/>
"How does it feel?" what I'm askin'<br/>
While I'm rubbin' on that ass "Why you laughin'?"<br/>
see, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious<br/>
full blown and furious<br/>
Baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this<br/>
It's so physical my attraction<br/>
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction<br/>
baby I'm born to ball<br/>
thugged out on Death Row<br/>
You better recognize and picture what I said so<br/>
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion<br/>
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jewell (DJ Quik):]</i><br/>
