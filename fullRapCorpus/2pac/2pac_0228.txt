Hahah! Yeah nigga fuck that gin and juice (Hennessy)<br/>
Just Pour a nigga a glass<br/>
Hennessey, that dark shit (That's right)<br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice:]</i><br/>
Ay pour me some of that too baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac (Obie Trice):]</i><br/>
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
(Yo what's our motherfuckin' motto nigga?)<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
(You know our motherfuckin' motto)<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this ol' thug shit<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
(That's what you're sipping on, now what's your name nigga?)<br/>
Big ballin' ass nigga named 'Pac<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Now I was born in the gutter facing life or death<br/>
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath<br/>
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I<br/>
To try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggas fry<br/>
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessy<br/>
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed<br/>
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me<br/>
Now that it's popping ain't no love bitch<br/>
I maintain in the game in the gutter's where I still kick it<br/>
I'm trying to hustle up a meal ticket<br/>
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dying days<br/>
Ain't nuttin wrong with getting paid, so nigga blaze<br/>
Cause we some motherfuckin' fools<br/>
Walking through the streets wearing jewels, breaking niggas making moves<br/>
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip<br/>
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac (Obie Trice):]</i><br/>
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
(Yo what's our motherfuckin' motto nigga?)<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
(You know our motherfuckin' motto)<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this ol' thug shit<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
(That's what I'm sipping on, now let me tell 'em who I be)<br/>
Big ballin' ass nigga named Trice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice (2Pac):]</i><br/>
Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's west<br/>
Troubled child coming up I had to ride I guess<br/>
Tried to apply myself, them niggas was balling<br/>
My mama couldn't tell me shit, the streets was calling<br/>
I was often involved with niggas breaking the law<br/>
I look back, 'Pac nigga, we was banking off raw<br/>
P-Funk got it pumping, he had the connects<br/>
Threw the sack to his lil' niggas working the set<br/>
And if you got it you getting wet, nigga bet on that<br/>
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit<br/>
Detroit niggas off shit<br/>
(Robbin niggas in the do'ways) That's right<br/>
(With my four-four, that's the sure way)<br/>
And this your road days, All Eyez on Me<br/>
We was looney I suppose, you could (die homie)<br/>
O. Trice always rep his block<br/>
Pass the Henn and that ice<br/>
I'm on a track with 'Pac nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac (Obie Trice):]</i><br/>
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
(Yo what's our motherfuckin' motto nigga?)<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle<br/>
(You know our motherfuckin' motto)<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this ol' thug shit<br/>
Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Obie Trice:]</i><br/>
Yeah, ay 'Pac, 'Pac, nigga Detroit love you boy<br/>
You put it down out here, I mean, y'know<br/>
Me and my family, my friends, nigga we ride for you always<br/>
2Pacalypse Now 'til infinity boy, forever<br/>

Obie Trice, pour out a lil' liquor nigga
