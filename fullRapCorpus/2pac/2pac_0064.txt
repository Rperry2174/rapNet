<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Ay what time is it nigga?<br/>
("I don't know.")<br/>
Oh shit, 12 o'clock<br/>
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here<br/>
("Hell yeah.")<br/>
Nigga, it's check out time nigga<br/>
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room<br/>
("Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?")<br/>
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs<br/>
("Where K and them niggas at man?")<br/>
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around<br/>
("Ay, y'all seen my shoes?")<br/>
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, whassup?<br/>
("Man, I'm rollin' man, fuck that shit.")<br/>
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool<br/>
("Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga.")<br/>
Aw nigga, damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'<br/>
Just another sunny day in California<br/>
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers<br/>
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us<br/>
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas<br/>
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us<br/>
Last night was like a fantasy, Aliz√© and Hennessy<br/>
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me<br/>
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did<br/>
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch<br/>
First you argued, then I fight it, 'til you lick me where I like it<br/>
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it<br/>
I never got to check out the scene<br/>
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans<br/>
Now it seems, it's check out time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Walker:]</i><br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Gotta go, gotta go<br/>
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time!<br/>
Gotta go nigga, gotta go<br/>
("Y'all know what time it is!")<br/>
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man, call that valet motherfucker<br/>
Tell him to get a nigga shit, cause we out this, motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid<br/>
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade<br/>
But did it all, end too soon<br/>
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room<br/>
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke<br/>
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night<br/>
My game's trump tight<br/>
So I find time to recline<br/>
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds<br/>
I ain't got that much time<br/>
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind<br/>
Since I'm only here for one night<br/>
I got to get you hot and heated<br/>
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It<br/>
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out<br/>
cause there's someone else who deserves my attention<br/>
So all the homies round up in the lobby<br/>
Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga<br/>
It's check out time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Walker:]</i><br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
Aiyyo man 'Pac, ay, where the where the fuck is Daz at man?<br/>
This nigga locked up or somethin'?<br/>
The only one not to leave<br/>
Yo man, it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother<br/>
(You seem them bitches?)<br/>
We out man, fuck that shit<br/>
Yo Rece! Yo nigga, whassup?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Syke:]</i><br/>
Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa<br/>
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later<br/>
My behavior is crazy from what you did to me baby<br/>
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me<br/>
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed<br/>
Carressin' your thoughts, cause I'm livin' fed, heard what I said?<br/>
Passion is crashin' the room<br/>
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom<br/>
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'<br/>
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way<br/>
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night<br/>
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight<br/>
Out of sight from 'Pac and Kurupt<br/>
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck<br/>
In a heaty, sticky situation<br/>
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation<br/>
It's check out time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Walker:]</i><br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Syke:]</i><br/>
Ay, it's check out time<br/>
Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin', where my shoes go, nigga?<br/>
Where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?<br/>
Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much<br/>
What the fuck y'all doin', nigga?<br/>
Kurupt, go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas<br/>
C'mon man, niggas is trippin' man<br/>
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man<br/>
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Walker:]</i><br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
We gotta go, we gotta go!<br/>
<br/>
We gotta go! Oooo!<br/>
We gotta, go!<br/>
We, hey!<br/>
We! We gotta go! Haaa!<br/>
We gotta, go! Haa!
