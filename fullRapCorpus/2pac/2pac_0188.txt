<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Haha<br/>
For all my niggas in the hood (yeah!)<br/>
Livin' the life of a ghetto star<br/>
(you know) You know how we do it hahaha<br/>
Makaveli<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Just holla my name and witness game official<br/>
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches<br/>
While I remain inside a paradox called my block<br/>
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?<br/>
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high<br/>
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn't have tried<br/>
I send they bodies to they parents up North<br/>
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off<br/>
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues<br/>
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come<br/>
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter<br/>
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter<br/>
Eat a dick, biyotch mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?<br/>
Bring it on, forever strapped<br/>
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far<br/>
Just sell me your soul, and live the life (of a ghetto star)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nutt-So:]</i><br/>
I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight<br/>
Mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life<br/>
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain<br/>
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain<br/>
Street smart, proficient, intelligent<br/>
And keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it<br/>
Movin' niggas with telekinesis<br/>
Keepin' Channel 7 at work, filmin' different features<br/>
Leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown<br/>
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone<br/>
And hope niggas got punished<br/>
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck, rappers waiting to get done in<br/>
Back<i>[?]</i> - we tossed his ass out<br/>
M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth<br/>
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' G<br/>
Now the next generation's lookin' at me through <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried<br/>
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me<br/>
Please give me shelter, calm my fears<br/>
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears<br/>
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid<br/>
2 shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic<br/>
Buried the bastard, time to notify<br/>
His family, sheeit, ain't nothing left to be identified<br/>
Evacuate the crime scene fast<br/>
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass<br/>
Why, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana<br/>
Set up shop selling them crooked cops marijuana<br/>
Label me a success, I made the switch<br/>
Retired from the life that never gave me shit<br/>
Put cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars<br/>
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nutt-So:]</i><br/>
Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this<br/>
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip<br/>
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down<br/>
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin' shit down<br/>
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'<br/>
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder<br/>
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh<br/>
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest<br/>
Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free<br/>
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody<br/>
I guess they heard that I got them birds<br/>
Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb<br/>
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich<br/>
With a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick<br/>
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches<br/>
By givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
When I grow up I wanna be like them<br/>
My life as a ghetto star<br/>
When I grow up I wanna be like them<br/>
My life as a ghetto star<br/>
When I grow up I wanna be like them<br/>
Live my life as a ghetto star<br/>
When I grow up I wanna be like them<br/>
And live my life as a ghetto star<br/>
When I grow up I wanna be like them<br/>
Live my life as a ghetto star<br/>
When I grow up I wanna be like them<br/>
And live my life as a ghetto star<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac w/ Nutt-So talking in background:]</i><br/>
This goes out to all you motherfuckers (to all you motherfuckers)<br/>
That STILL, have to kill to make that money (still, I'll be puttin' down)<br/>
All you niggas on the block, sellin' rocks<br/>
Hand to hand, runnin' from the police (sellin' motherfuckin' dopes)<br/>
(smokin' weed)<br/>
I see you<br/>
Live your life as a ghetto star<br/>
(look at these tramp ass hoes) Talk to the hood<br/>
Claimin' gettin' riches<br/>
(spank bitches ain't new)<br/>
Runnin' from new playa haters (any fake ass niggas)<br/>
Live my life as a ghetto star<br/>
(this is still 70 south)<br/>
Niggas with two strikes that don't wanna see the third (nah), I feel you<br/>
It's the Don Makaveli - live my life as a ghetto star
