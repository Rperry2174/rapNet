<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I'm loyal to the game<br/>
<br/>
Now I've got task on a nigga's ass<br/>
Tell me will they blast me<br/>
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now<br/>
It's gettin' crazy after dark<br/>
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart<br/>
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary<br/>
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary<br/>
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me<br/>
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me<br/>
I got some killas on my payroll and they know<br/>
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low<br/>
Although I'm young I'm still coming up<br/>
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up<br/>
The first to pull the strap when there's drama<br/>
Buster you ain't heard?<br/>
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama<br/>
There ain't a cop that can stop me<br/>
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me<br/>
I'm loyal to the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent (2Pac):]</i><br/>
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'<br/>
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing<br/>
(Man I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'<br/>
(I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Buck:]</i><br/>
Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home<br/>
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone<br/>
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink<br/>
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink<br/>
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink<br/>
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think<br/>
So look like I'mma be the man of the house<br/>
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out<br/>
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it<br/>
They say if you really want it then come on with it<br/>
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars<br/>
And I only spent 30 days behind bars<br/>
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid<br/>
I handled any beef that they sent my way<br/>
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change<br/>
It's thug in my veins<br/>
I'm loyal to the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent (2Pac):]</i><br/>
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'<br/>
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing<br/>
(Man I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'<br/>
(I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd Banks:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
It ain't my fault I came up fast<br/>
And your the name niggas bring up last<br/>
And all the dames get a king up ass<br/>
10 grand on every ring I flash<br/>
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass<br/>
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot<br/>
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block<br/>
I get 'dro by the pickle jar<br/>
These broke niggas wanna get the star<br/>
So I don't keep the four-nickel far<br/>
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game<br/>
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain<br/>
Get more slugs to boil in your frame<br/>
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain<br/>
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range<br/>
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change<br/>
I'm good now but the fact still remains<br/>
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent (2Pac):]</i><br/>
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'<br/>
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing<br/>
(Man I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'<br/>
(I'm loyal to the game)<br/>
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[G-Unit &amp; 2Pac:]</i><br/>
