<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
'Cuz I'm a soldier.<br/>
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer.<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Westside Outlaw, Bad Boy killer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac]</i><br/>
Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters<br/>
We open fire, who can stop us<br/>
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin for righteous<br/>
Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us<br/>
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us<br/>
ATF state feds scandalous bitches<br/>
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet<br/>
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat<br/>
Only streets livin do or die circle complete<br/>
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese<br/>
Please understand my history a man of many acts<br/>
Livin Thug Life, comin equipped, with many gats<br/>
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time<br/>
Livin in between life, and the cracks were blind<br/>
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came<br/>
Yet and still we all feel pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
'Cuz I'm a soldier.<br/>
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer.<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Westside Outlaw, Bad Boy killer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble]</i><br/>
My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with<br/>
a three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive<br/>
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust<br/>
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut<br/>
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her<br/>
The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer<br/>
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over<br/>
Never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack<br/>
My stack's fat, I used to take new<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
'Cuz I'm a soldier.<br/>
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer.<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Westside Outlaw, Bad Boy killer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I. Mean]</i><br/>
I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday<br/>
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate<br/>
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb<br/>
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon<br/>
to be one of the many misguided<br/>
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it<br/>
Lost before I had a chance to find my way<br/>
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day<br/>
<br/>
...thug niggas screamin Westside, bustin double glocks...
