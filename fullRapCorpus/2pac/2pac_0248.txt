<i>[Intro 2Pac &amp; Eminem]</i> Fuck all yall, Fuck em All, My have your attention please, I repeat,<br/>
My have your attention please we're gonna have a problem here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath<br/>
<br/>
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin<br/>
I slash her in the ass with a icicle<br/>
And leave her laying a blood bath<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac]</i> <br/>
Murderous mind state, <br/>
Can't keep my nine straight, <br/>
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break, <br/>
Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize <br/>
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw, Ridaz, <br/>
<br/>

<i>[Eminem]</i> Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath<br/>
<br/>

<i>[2Pac]</i> <br/>
Murderous mind state, <br/>
Can't keep my nine straight, <br/>
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break, <br/>
Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize <br/>
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw, Ridaz, <br/>
Untouchable mob of pistol packers, <br/>
Well-known felons labeled for 'drug-selling merciless jackers', <br/>
Forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs, <br/>
Commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Proof]</i> <br/>
I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk.<br/>
80 Proof for this rocker, that's the name I want.<br/>
Or the aisle in the back, bump a seven deuce.<br/>
See that top on that 40, you know it's comin' loose.<br/>
See me on the Av. daily, we runnin' this shit.<br/>
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch.<br/>
Packin mags and clips, I'll smash your clique.<br/>
Because of Proof they put the "G" in the alphabet.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> I'm the devil. if ever there was such a thing<br/>
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing<br/>
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gus)-ting<br/>
I'm (white), a human mutt, fuck a being<br/>
I'm a dog - fuck lambs, I'm silencin 'em all<br/>
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve<br/>
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers<br/>
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Feel the wrath of a psychopath, wrath of a psychopath, Feel the wrath of a psychopath, The wrath of a psychopath<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i> Outro Shoutouts
