<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Hey Nate you know you got to focus on this motherfucker<br/>
We's gonna talk about these scandalous hoes<br/>
<i>[Nate:]</i><br/>
I can talk about scandalous bitches<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Oh I know you can!<br/>
I know you that's why we gonna do it<br/>
Daz on the beat<br/>
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin around with the piano nigga<br/>
Just drop that shit like uh, this here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me<br/>
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony<br/>
It's not for me, you see no lovin from my closest homies<br/>
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me<br/>
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed<br/>
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools<br/>
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house<br/>
And can't leave without his bitch permission<br/>
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss<br/>
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss<br/>
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain<br/>
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, "Never breathing again"<br/>
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, trick<br/>
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?<br/>
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust<br/>
But bitches lookin scandalous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg:]</i><br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
How's it hangin? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin<br/>
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang<br/>
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin<br/>
This bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin<br/>
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze<br/>
You're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies<br/>
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize<br/>
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes<br/>
My sister precious in poverty<br/>
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?<br/>
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue<br/>
And though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come<br/>
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin?<br/>
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later<br/>
Before I let her get me, I got her<br/>
Went in her purse took a hundred dollars<br/>
Nigga I'm so scandalous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg:]</i><br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches<br/>
I'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches<br/>
Currency motivated, not easily terminated<br/>
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded<br/>
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid<br/>
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves<br/>
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true<br/>
When I don't fuck with your punk crew<br/>
These are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell<br/>
I went from hell, to livin well<br/>
Bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain<br/>
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game<br/>
I wanna be a baller, please<br/>
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me<br/>
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans<br/>
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg:]</i><br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg repeats to end (2Pac speaks over):]</i><br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous<br/>
(Aiyyo. How the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be<br/>
You ever peep that shit? (Nah)<br/>
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga 35<br/>
Gettin him for ends<br/>
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent<br/>
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then<br/>
That's aight though<br/>
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long<br/>
Watch them hoes<br/>
All you niggaz out there<br/>
Beware these lyin ass scandalous bitches)
