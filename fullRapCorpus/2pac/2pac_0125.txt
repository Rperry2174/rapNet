<i>[Roger Troutman:]</i><br/>
California love<br/>
California knows how to party<br/>
California knows how to party<br/>
In the city of L.A<br/>
In the city of good ol' Watts<br/>
In the city, the city of Compton<br/>
We keep it rockin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west<br/>
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness<br/>
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest<br/>
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex<br/>
We in that sunshine state with the bomb-ass hemp beat<br/>
The state where you never find a dance floor empty<br/>
And pimps be on a mission for them greens<br/>
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends<br/>
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes<br/>
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon<br/>
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me<br/>
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace<br/>
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay<br/>
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay<br/>
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way<br/>
Dre putting it down for Californ-i-a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roger Troutman:]</i><br/>
California knows how to party<br/>
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)<br/>
In the city of L.A<br/>
In the city of good ol' Watts<br/>
In the city, the city of Compton<br/>
We keep it rockin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roger Troutman:]</i><br/>
Shake, shake it, baby<br/>
Shake, shake it, mama<br/>
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby<br/>
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming<br/>
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming<br/>
Fiending for money and alcohol<br/>
The life of a Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball<br/>
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die<br/>
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)<br/>
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do<br/>
Flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews<br/>
Famous because we program<br/>
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans<br/>
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside<br/>
So you know the row won't bow down to no man<br/>
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre<br/>
Let me serenade the streets of L.A<br/>
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down<br/>
Cali is where they put their mack down<br/>
Give me love!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roger Troutman:]</i><br/>
California knows how to party<br/>
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)<br/>
In the city of L.A<br/>
In the city of good ol' Watts<br/>
In the city, the city of Compton<br/>
We keep it rockin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i> South Central<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Uh, that's right<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i> Now make it shake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roger Troutman:]</i><br/>
Shake, shake it, baby<br/>
Shake, shake it, mama<br/>
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby<br/>
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Shake it Cali<br/>
Uh, uh, West Coast<br/>
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house<br/>
Uh, yeah, Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house<br/>
Frisco, Frisco<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
And you know L.A. up in here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Pasadena where you at?<br/>
Yeah, Inglewood<br/>
Inglewood always up to no good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Throw it up ya'll, throw it up, throw it up!<br/>
I can't see ya<br/>
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this West Side<br/>
Cause you and I know it's the best side<br/>
Yeah, that's right<br/>
West coast, west coast
