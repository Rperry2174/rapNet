<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Thugs known to bust on sight<br/>
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life<br/>
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby<br/>
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die<br/>
Boss players you wonder why<br/>
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride<br/>
Bitches and niggas in Penitentiary suits<br/>
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops<br/>
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine<br/>
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime<br/>
My time as shorty was full of car chases<br/>
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's<br/>
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew<br/>
A million niggas with automatics who swarm through<br/>
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert<br/>
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches (keep it money over bitches)<br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hussein Fatal:]</i><br/>
I blow you up on the spot, these Glocks hot 'til you drop<br/>
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots<br/>
I beef deep with the police, peep what these streets do to me<br/>
Actin' all new to me, I creep on you like puberty<br/>
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage<br/>
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence<br/>
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya<br/>
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers<br/>
When I'm drinkin' Cristal, start thinkin' 'bout Al<br/>
Bacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile<br/>
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you<br/>
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew<br/>
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby<br/>
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>

And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>

<i>[Mopreme:]</i><br/>
My shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino<br/>
Comin' with the real yo, and fuck what you feel yo<br/>
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts<br/>
This is for my niggas nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt<br/>
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja<br/>
Bitches is a cobra, with deadly venom<br/>
Move as smooth as I get 'em<br/>
Stackin' G's, my niggas crosstown got ki's<br/>
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies<br/>
Money over bitches<br/>
(Nigga!)<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Big Syke:]</i><br/>
I'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over bitches<br/>
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches<br/>
I'm contrited to strive never laggin'<br/>
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'<br/>
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck<br/>
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a, fuck<br/>
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'<br/>
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven<br/>
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you<br/>
But stay true, and do the things that we do<br/>
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring<br/>
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings<br/>
Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time<br/>
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind<br/>
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches<br/>
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Yaki Kadafi:]</i><br/>
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin', I hope he awoken<br/>
Payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a Glocks smokin'<br/>
Money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless<br/>
Gettin' niggas fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles<br/>
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler<br/>
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya<br/>
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks<br/>
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops<br/>
Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches<br/>
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks<br/>
And you know we keep it money over bitches<br/>

<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
That's right nigga<br/>
Money over motherfuckin' bitches<br/>
M.O.B. on 'em nigga<br/>
Keep your motherfuckin' mind on your money, fuck these hoes<br/>
(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin' bitches<br/>
You need some motherfuckin' money<br/>
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight<br/>
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools<br/>
We up out of this bitch here.<br/>
BIATCH!
