<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Only God can judge me (that right?)<br/>
Only God can judge me now<br/>
Nobody else (nobody else)<br/>
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)<br/>
Only God can judge me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back<br/>
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats<br/>
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed<br/>
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see<br/>
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time<br/>
Look to my future, 'cause my past is all behind me<br/>
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?<br/>
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'<br/>
I've been trapped since birth, cautious 'cause I'm cursed<br/>
And fantasies of my family in a hearse<br/>
And they say it's the white man I should fear<br/>
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here<br/>
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side<br/>
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died<br/>
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for<br/>
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door<br/>
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed<br/>
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees<br/>
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix<br/>
'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me now<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Flatline]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it<br/>
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked<br/>
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV<br/>
'Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me<br/>
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies<br/>
I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets<br/>
I call the nurse 'cause it hurts to reminisce<br/>
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss <br/>
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here<br/>
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?<br/>
Try to remember, but it hurts<br/>
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt<br/>
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward<br/>
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours<br/>
"Black Power!" is what we scream<br/>
As we dream in a paranoid state<br/>
And our fate is a lifetime of hate<br/>
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace<br/>
'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat<br/>
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped<br/>
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped<br/>
Mr. Police, please try to see<br/>
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger<br/>
That's for real<br/>
and I don't see why everybody feel as though<br/>
that they gotta tell me how to live my life<br/>
You know?<br/>
Let me live, baby, let me live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rappin' 4-Tay:]</i><br/>
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala<br/>
For instance, say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya<br/>
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?<br/>
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'<br/>
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law<br/>
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross<br/>
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him<br/>
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him<br/>
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would<br/>
Tellin' them niggas, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would<br/>
It be them same motherfuckers in your face<br/>
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe<br/>
Knowin' you on that paper chase<br/>
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch<br/>
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce<br/>
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay<br/>
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay<br/>
Pac, when you was locked down<br/>
That's when I'll be around<br/>
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown<br/>
That's why they ride the bandwagon<br/>
Still be draggin' sellin' lies<br/>
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Guess you figure you know me, 'cause I'm a thug<br/>
That love to hit the late night club drink and buzzed<br/>
Been livin' lavish like a player all day<br/>
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me<br/>
Only God can judge me, only God<br/>
Only God can judge me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac (Rappin 4-Tay):]</i><br/>
(Only God, mane)<br/>
That right?<br/>
(That's real)<br/>
Hahahahahaha<br/>
(Fuck everybody else, you know what I'm sayin'?)<br/>
Man, look here, man<br/>
My only fear of death<br/>
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man<br/>
That's for the homie mental<br/>
(Hehehehe)<br/>
We up out
