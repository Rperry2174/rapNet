<i>[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]</i><br/>
(They say)<br/>
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'<br/>
Where I can pile up my chips<br/>
And niggas call me a timer<br/>
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')<br/>
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'<br/>
(That's right, that's right boy, start that shit off)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized<br/>
Pictures of me in my final stage, you know mama cried<br/>
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted<br/>
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'<br/>
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find<br/>
Where I spend most of my time, my California grind<br/>
Watchin' for thievin', I'm cautious, it's like I'm barely breathin'<br/>
Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me a reason<br/>
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded <br/>
You tried to play me, now homicide is my only payment<br/>
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead<br/>
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G?<br/>
For the life of me, I cannot see<br/>
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me<br/>
And if you don't like this rhyme <br/>
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]</i><br/>
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'<br/>
Where I can pile up my chips<br/>
And niggas call me a timer<br/>
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')<br/>
Motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[C-Bo:]</i><br/>
I got my locs on, hard hat, goin' to war<br/>
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights<br/>
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap out my drawers<br/>
And get to dumpin' on they ass like the last outlaw<br/>
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips<br/>
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip<br/>
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt<br/>
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B-Legit:]</i><br/>
I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit<br/>
Movin' Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip<br/>
I'm ridin' shotgun with the tint in the back<br/>
I'm plan to have a motherfuckin' mint in this rap<br/>
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O <br/>
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know<br/>
I got blow, speed, and weed, whatever yo' kind<br/>
And if you need a motherfucker, I ain't hard to find<br/>
<br/>
<i>[D-Shot:]</i><br/>
Some may call me bootsy, but I call it timin'<br/>
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)<br/>
to the point where a nigga can't stop<br/>
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch<br/>
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho<br/>
get in my way, then that ass gots to go<br/>
'Cause a nigga steady plottin'<br/>
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]</i><br/>
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'<br/>
Where I can pile up my chips<br/>
And niggas call me a timer<br/>
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')<br/>
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[(2Pac), E-40:]</i><br/>
(C-Bo, D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich)<br/>
Da Bay, beitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E-40:]</i><br/>
Down the steps <br/>
Abandoned broken down apartment complex<br/>
Heavy metal weapons they carry, can't be scary<br/>
Playboy, what the fuck is a proof without the trauma plate?<br/>
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for if you gon' hesitate?<br/>
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas<br/>
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas<br/>
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him<br/>
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him, have at him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Richie Rich:]</i><br/>
(Check this out)<br/>
I grew up with that nigga<br/>
Threw up with that nigga<br/>
I hear he tryin' to ride<br/>
Double agent for the other side<br/>
But now, my Glock be so judgmental<br/>
Back seat of a rental<br/>
Keep my name out your dental, nigga<br/>
If your gum bleedin' and you needin'<br/>
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches<br/>
Sideways to the next<br/>
Heavy in the game<br/>
Check the resident, it's all the same<br/>
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ad-libs â€” 2Pac, C-BO &amp; E-40:]</i><br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Hell nah we ain't hard to find<br/>
<i>[C-Bo:]</i> The whole Clickalation fool<br/>
<i>[E-40:]</i> Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Why them niggas actin' like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at?<br/>
<i>[D-Shot:]</i> It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?<br/>
<i>[C-Bo:]</i> Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit<br/>
<i>[D-Shot:]</i> It's a celebration<br/>
<i>[E-40:]</i> Motherfuckers better understand this shit<br/>
<i>[D-Shot:]</i> Young 'Pac is back<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Ay D-Shot, nigga, can we get paid man?<br/>
Can we just go there and sock this shit up, please?<br/>
<i>[D-Shot:]</i> Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some Hurricane<br/>
<i>[E-40:]</i> A motherfucker's gonna get his marbles regardless, playboy<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> You supposed to<br/>
<i>[RIch:]</i> Sideways to the next light, and to the next coast, poppin' the muthafuckin' most, you understand what I'm sayin'<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i> Money over bitches, nigga, M.O.B., M.O.B.
