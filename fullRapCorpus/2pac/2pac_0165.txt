<i>[Lil' Mo:]</i><br/>
2Pac and Lil' Mo, hmm, how gangsta is that?<br/>
Hehe... ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[*Mo keeps harmonizing in the background*]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
One two to a nigga nature, haha.<br/>
No need to cry now, go wipe your tears, be a woman<br/>
Why you actin' surprised? You saw the bullshit<br/>
Comin' fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too<br/>
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too<br/>
Ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda though about it<br/>
Say you learned, I truly doubt it<br/>
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love<br/>
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club<br/>
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom PÃ©rignon<br/>
Knowin' I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm<br/>
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me<br/>
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me<br/>
Missed me with that "Buy me this, buy me that" syndrome shit<br/>
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich<br/>
Gettin' mad cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha<br/>
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Mo:]</i><br/>
Kissed the girls, made them cry<br/>
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high<br/>
Why you gangsta, all the time?<br/>
That's a thug's nature (that's a nigga nature)<br/>
Though sometimes, I can deal with it<br/>
I realize, that I'm feelin' it<br/>
It's a love and hate relationship<br/>
But that's a thug's nature<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts<br/>
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt<br/>
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it<br/>
See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it<br/>
Little ecstasy, Hennessy, mix with me<br/>
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free<br/>
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes<br/>
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses<br/>
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet<br/>
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit<br/>
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops<br/>
Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastard drop<br/>
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite<br/>
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night<br/>
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager<br/>
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Mo:]</i><br/>
Kissed the girls, made them cry<br/>
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high<br/>
Why you gangsta, all the time?<br/>
That's a thug's nature<br/>
Though sometimes, I can deal with it<br/>
I realize, that I'm feelin' it<br/>
It's a love and hate relationship<br/>
But that's a thug's nature<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Haha, started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts<br/>
Lustin' for creamin' - bitches with big butts<br/>
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit<br/>
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks<br/>
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time<br/>
Put my name tattooed so that ass is mine<br/>
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good<br/>
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me<br/>
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby<br/>
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?<br/>
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die<br/>
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly<br/>
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die<br/>
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God<br/>
Understand my ways, livin' major<br/>
Blessed with a thug's heart and a real live nigga nature<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Mo:]</i><br/>
Kissed the girls, made them cry<br/>
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high<br/>
Why you gangsta, all the time?<br/>
That's a thug's nature (that's a nigga nature)<br/>
Though sometimes, I can deal with it<br/>
I realize, that I'm feelin' it<br/>
It's a love and hate relationship<br/>
But that's a thug's nature (cause that's a nigga nature)<br/>
Kissed the girls, made them cry<br/>
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high<br/>
Why you gangsta, all the time?<br/>
That's a thug's nature (hey, just be a nigga nature)<br/>
Though sometimes, I can deal with it<br/>
I realize, that I'm feelin' it<br/>
It's a love and hate relationship<br/>
But that's a thug's nature (cause that's a nigga nature)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac &amp; Lil' Mo:]</i><br/>
It ain't my fault<br/>
Hehe, Q.D., where you be? Ah<br/>
Don't blame me blame my momma, a nigga nature<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Mo harmonizing:]</i><br/>
QDIII, and Lil' Mo<br/>
2Pac, puttin' it down fo' sho' ("'cause that's a nigga nature")<br/>
I realize, that I'm feelin' it<br/>
Cause that's a thug nature<br/>
Though sometimes I can deal with it<br/>
I realize, I'm feelin' it<br/>
Love and hate, relationship<br/>
Cause that's a thug's nature ("'cause that's a nigga nature")<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah. <br/>
Yeah yeah, and that's a thug's nature<br/>
<br/>
Where you at? Holla
