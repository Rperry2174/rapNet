Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug!<br/>
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
<br/>
Was a nice middle-class nigga<br/>
But no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger<br/>
You'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a Newport<br/>
Plotting on a another way to catch a case<br/>
Was only 16, yet convicted as a felon<br/>
With a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'<br/>
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school<br/>
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules<br/>
And fade fools, break rules until we major<br/>
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager<br/>
Was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics<br/>
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics<br/>
My finger's on the trigger<br/>
Tell the Lord to make way for another straight thug nigga<br/>
I'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love<br/>
From the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug<br/>
<br/>
Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be<br/>
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he's wanna be, said he's wanna be<br/>
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
<br/>
Straight from the hall to the pen<br/>
An adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten<br/>
He carried weight, like a Mack truck<br/>
Gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff<br/>
Then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor<br/>
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up<br/>
No one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger<br/>
Could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger<br/>
No mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone<br/>
Old timers my role model, the war zone<br/>
Been laced with this game 'til it's a part of me<br/>
My heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see<br/>
The future is looking dim<br/>
I'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin<br/>
I'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love<br/>
Out with the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug<br/>
<br/>
Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be<br/>
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be<br/>
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
<br/>
Shorty's gonna be a thug<br/>
Little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas<br/>
Gotta stay sharp, nigga, play your part!<br/>
Got plenty of time (you bad mothafuckas)<br/>
You only get three mistakes, and then it's life, big baby<br/>
(Niggas craaazy) Watch the signs!<br/>
Damn, nigga! Sixteen, nigga?<br/>
Sixteen?! Too bad, mothafuckers
