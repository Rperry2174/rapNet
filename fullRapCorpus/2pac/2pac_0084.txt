Are you still down? <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong<br/>
And mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born<br/>
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style<br/>
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild<br/>
And the fame was a plot to try to change me<br/>
And what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came<br/>
Now the whole world is calling me a killer<br/>
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real<br/>
All the time I was ballin', never heard my friends callin'<br/>
Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in<br/>
Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me<br/>
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy<br/>
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought<br/>
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' "One time!"<br/>
Take your time to feel my record<br/>
And if you did, chill a second<br/>
My blind method, will still wreck it<br/>
My young homies stay strong<br/>
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone<br/>
Are you still down?<br/>
<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
<br/>
I'm gettin' high, so a nigga think, he touch the sky<br/>
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die<br/>
Livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth<br/>
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God<br/>
Come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me<br/>
And got a nigga goin' crazy<br/>
I can't read the signs<br/>
I'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine<br/>
Cause times, they ain't what they used to be<br/>
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me<br/>
And my niggas on the streets, man, listen<br/>
Cause these ain't the old days<br/>
Ain't no way, I'mma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay<br/>
It seems I can't find my focus and homie, I ain't paranoid<br/>
I seen the future and it's hopeless<br/>
Lord knows, it's hard on a young scrub<br/>
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs<br/>
But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game<br/>
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name<br/>
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me<br/>
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see<br/>
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear<br/>
This one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down<br/>
<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this for my critics and my enemies<br/>
Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me<br/>
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix<br/>
I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks<br/>
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail<br/>
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell<br/>
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped<br/>
And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me<br/>
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me<br/>
My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry<br/>
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, "Baby, it's on!"<br/>
And now I'm hustlin' and bustlin' bones<br/>
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' cheese<br/>
Buyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed<br/>
Wish my homeboys could see me now<br/>
Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town<br/>
Please tell me, are you still down?<br/>
<br/>
Are you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me <i>[2x]</i><br/>
Are you still down, to raise 'em up?<br/>
Are you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Are you still down, to raise 'em up?<br/>
Are you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Are you still down, to raise 'em up?<br/>
<br/>
That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin' middle finger<br/>
Raise 'em up<br/>
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?<br/>
Thug life niggas be the sickest<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
Now get that shit written down<br/>
God damn!<br/>
Took four years and a motherfuckin' case for these motherfuckers to feel me<br/>
Ain't that a bitch?<br/>
Are you still motherfuckin' down?<br/>
Old ho ass fake ass niggas<br/>
We out this motherfucker though
