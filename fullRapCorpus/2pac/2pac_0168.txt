This ain't livin', nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I hear even the smaller G's be dippin' Chevy Impalas<br/>
While flossin' their gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow<br/>
We swallow tomorrow's seed, what we leave is hollow<br/>
We feed violence and greed, let 'em lead tomorrow<br/>
In time, they grip a nine, sippin' wine, they rap<br/>
Still I be starin', watch the parents sacrifice their child<br/>
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love<br/>
Feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug dealers<br/>
Now one for adolescents, now dos for those<br/>
Keep your friends by your side, even close your foes<br/>
Now three for Johnny Law tryin' to take my chips<br/>
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch<br/>
Throw your hands in the air, it's a robbery<br/>
(censored) 'Pac, would you ride with me?<br/>
Let's go see what our enemies talkin' 'bout<br/>
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin' out<br/>
This ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we're trapped<br/>
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped<br/>
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven<br/>
And never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know<br/>
This is how it goes when we floss with flows<br/>
Before I toss your ho, it'll cost you mo'<br/>
I do shows, make a lot of dough, murder my foes<br/>
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow<br/>
This ain't livin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vanessa (2Pac):]</i><br/>
Takes a life to make a life, takes a life<br/>
Livin' in the world of crime and I, takes a life<br/>
(This ain't livin')<br/>
Can't find a better way to break through<br/>
(This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do)<br/>
(This ain't livin')<br/>
Takes a life to make a life, takes a life<br/>
Livin' in the world of crime and I, takes a life<br/>
Can't find a better way to break through<br/>
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Peep it â€“ gunfire is produced at alarmin' rates<br/>
Today's youth, quick to shoot, get in the car and break<br/>
"It Takes a Nation of Millions" if we intend to stop the killin'<br/>
Just search your feelings, participatin' should be appealin'<br/>
They're our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed<br/>
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's<br/>
Heavenly father can you rescue<br/>
My young nation, rest the Lord will protect you, respect due<br/>
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those<br/>
That oppose when I froze them fools<br/>
And who are you, to watch me fall farther?<br/>
I disappeared, reappeared as the (censored)<br/>
Follow me now<br/>
Skippin' class, and livin' fast, will get your ass<br/>
Stuck in the Pen', doin' life plus ten<br/>
Young brother pump your brakes for me<br/>
Before you choke, won't you soak up some game from your big homie<br/>
This ain't livin', we givin' you jewels, use 'em as tools<br/>
Explode on they industry and fade them fools<br/>
You know the rules, gotta be a rider<br/>
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, hey<br/>
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin' hell<br/>
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself<br/>
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G<br/>
Gotta change your life, take the game from me<br/>
This ain't livin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vanessa:]</i><br/>
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)<br/>
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)<br/>
Can't find a better way to break through<br/>
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do<br/>
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)<br/>
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)<br/>
Can't find a better way to break through<br/>
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do<br/>
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)<br/>
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)<br/>
Can't find a better way to break through<br/>
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do<br/>
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)<br/>
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)<br/>
Can't find a better way to break through<br/>
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do
