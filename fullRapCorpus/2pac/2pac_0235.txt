T.I<br/>
Ashanti <br/>
It's that new 'Pac, y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ashanti:]</i><br/>
Pac's life <br/>
(Everybody needs to chill)<br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life<br/>
(It's 2Pac the king)<br/>
What do you know about Pac's life?<br/>
(What do you know? What do you know?) <br/>
(Only real niggas stay on top) <br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life<br/>
(Outlawz) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him<br/>
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million <br/>
Hit the charts like a mad man nothin' but hits<br/>
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits <br/>
Dodgin' cop cars look how we come so far<br/>
Picture a high school drop out <br/>
Rollin' a double R<br/>
House full of happiness, weed and drank <br/>
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me can't<br/>
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first <br/>
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt<br/>
And though it hurts to see the change <br/>
It comes with the fame <br/>
Watch them gossip in this silly game <br/>
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night <br/>
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life? <br/>
To all y'all niggas, conversating on my life<br/>
Mind your motherfucking business <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ashanti:]</i><br/>
Pac's life <br/>
(Everybody needs to chill)<br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life<br/>
(It's 2Pac the king)<br/>
What do you know about Pac's life?<br/>
(What do you know? What do you know?) <br/>
(Only real niggas stay on top) <br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life<br/>
(Outlawz) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I:]</i><br/>
I remember that <br/>
Ay <br/>
What's happening Pac <br/>
Yeah I know we never got to meet <br/>
But we know all the same people so we got to speak <br/>
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G <br/>
And all the shit you went through <br/>
Meant a lot to me <br/>
But when they locked you up for nothing it was shame to see<br/>
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me <br/>
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be <br/>
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me <br/>
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see <br/>
Now they all in the court room blaming me <br/>
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle <br/>
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's <br/>
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em <br/>
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's <br/>
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's <br/>
With the same sort of dude with the same short fuse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ashanti:]</i><br/>
Pac's life <br/>

Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life<br/>
(Outlawz) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I want money in large amounts <br/>
My garage full of cars that bounce <br/>
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts <br/>
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks <br/>
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump <br/>
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary <br/>
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass <br/>
Nigga you scary, I been knowing you for years<br/>
We was high school peers, in Junior High<br/>
I was itching' to kill, and you was, 'Ready To Die'<br/>
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases <br/>
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places <br/>
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried <br/>
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried<br/>
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'mma ride<br/>
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfucker's die<br/>
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is<br/>
Only real niggas stay on top <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ashanti:]</i><br/>
Pac's life <br/>

Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life<br/>

What do you know about Pac's life?<br/>

Why are all you niggas all up in my shit? <br/>
Tell them motherfucker's <br/>
