<i>[Virginya Slim:]</i><br/>
Shit, you mothafuckin' right!<br/>
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot<br/>
When you punk-ass niggas don't<br/>
Nigga, westside! What?! Bring it on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind<br/>
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend<br/>
Doing 85 when we ride<br/>
Trapped in this world of sin<br/>
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
C'mon, our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom<br/>
Smoking sherm, drinking malt liquor, father forgive 'em<br/>
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'<br/>
Fell in love with the struggle<br/>
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'<br/>
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'<br/>
Automatic gunfire exorcising all demons<br/>
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die<br/>
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas united<br/>
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked<br/>
Touch you in every secret place, I could hardly wait<br/>
To bust freely, got you red-hot, you so happy to see me<br/>
Make the frontpage primetime live on TV<br/>
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live<br/>
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Virginya Slim:]</i><br/>
What?! I'm busting on you punk ass niggas<br/>
Run, nigga, run! I'm on your ass, nigga<br/>
Run, nigga! Duck and hide when I'm bustin' on all you bitches!<br/>
Run, nigga! Yeah, west side!<br/>
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
My girlfriend: blacker than the darkest night<br/>
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight<br/>
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times<br/>
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine<br/>
Picked you up when you was 9<br/>
Started out my life of crime with you<br/>
Bought you some shells when you turned 22<br/>
It's true, nothing compares to the satisfaction<br/>
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
All I need in this life of sin<br/>
Is me and my girlfriend<br/>
Down to ride to the bloody end<br/>
Just me and my girlfriend<br/>
All I need in this life of sin<br/>
Is me and my girlfriend<br/>
Down to ride to the bloody end<br/>
Just me and my girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I was too immature to understand your ways<br/>
Inexperienced back in the days<br/>
Caused so many arguments and strays<br/>
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you<br/>
Being faithful, 'cause now cheating's lethal<br/>
We're closer than the hands of time<br/>
Deeper than the drive of mankind<br/>
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind<br/>
In time I clock figures, dropping niggas as we rise<br/>
We all soldiers in God's eyes<br/>
Now it's time for war; never leave me, baby<br/>
I'm paranoid, sleeping with you loaded by my bedside, crazy<br/>
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone<br/>
Anticipated for the moment you come home<br/>
I'm waiting by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it<br/>
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest<br/>
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all<br/>
You're the reason I can stand tall; me and my girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
All I need in this life of sin<br/>
Is me and my girlfriend<br/>
Down to ride to the bloody end<br/>
Just me and my girlfriend<br/>
All I need in this life of sin<br/>
Is me and my girlfriend<br/>
Down to ride to the bloody end<br/>
Just me and my girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I love finger-fucking you, all of a sudden I'm hearing thunder<br/>
When you bust a nut, niggas be ducking or taking numbers<br/>
Love to watch you at a block party, begging for drama<br/>
While unleashing on the old-timers, that's on my mama<br/>
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors<br/>
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm asking for<br/>
Talking to me, begging me to just take you around<br/>
Seventeen, like Brandy, you just wanna be down<br/>
Talking loud when I tell you be quiet<br/>
You move the crowd, busting rounds, activating a riot<br/>
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash<br/>
After a hit you, break apart, then back to one piece<br/>
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours<br/>
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power<br/>
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome<br/>
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
All I need in this life of sin<br/>
Is me and my girlfriend<br/>
Down to ride to the bloody end<br/>
Just me and my girlfriend<br/>
All I need in this life of sin<br/>
Is me and my girlfriend<br/>
Down to ride to the bloody end<br/>
Just me and my girlfriend<br/>
All I need in this life of sin<br/>
Me and my girlfriend<br/>
Down to ride to the bloody end<br/>
Me and my girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Lost in the whirlwind<br/>
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend<br/>
Doing 85 when we ride<br/>
Trapped in this world of sin<br/>
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind<br/>
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind<br/>
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend<br/>
Doing 85 when we ride<br/>
Trapped in this world of sin<br/>
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind<br/>
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind<br/>
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend<br/>
Doing 85 when we ride<br/>
Trapped in this world of sin<br/>
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind<br/>
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind<br/>
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend<br/>
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind<br/>
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend<br/>
Me and my girlfriend
