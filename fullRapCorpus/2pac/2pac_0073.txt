"Street Science, you're on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac's new one?"<br/>
"I love 2Pac's new record."<br/>
"Right, but don't you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he's talking about killing people, 'I had sex with your wife' — and not in those words. But he's talking about, 'I wanna see you deceased'…"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
To live and die in L.A., California<br/>
What you say about Los Angeles?<br/>
Still the only place for me<br/>
It never rains in Southern California<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
To live and die in L.A.<br/>
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets<br/>
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it<br/>
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'<br/>
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces<br/>
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart<br/>
Who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark<br/>
Cold-hearted 'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend<br/>
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream<br/>
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'<br/>
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'<br/>
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen<br/>
Making money off of cuss words, writin' again<br/>
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen<br/>
Late night down sunset, likin' the scene<br/>
What's the worst they could do to a nigga?<br/>
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Val Young (2Pac):]</i><br/>
(My angel sing)<br/>
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be<br/>
(And the angels go)<br/>
You've got to be there to know it<br/>
When everybody wanna see<br/>
(To live and die in L.A.)<br/>
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be<br/>
You've got to be there to know it<br/>
When everybody wanna see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
It's the City of Angels and constant danger<br/>
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger<br/>
Full of drama, like a soap opera, on the curb<br/>
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe<br/>
So many niggas getting three strikes, tossed in jail<br/>
I swear, the pen right across from hell<br/>
I can't cry, 'cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now<br/>
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile<br/>
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures<br/>
Thinking Cali just fun and bitches<br/>
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's<br/>
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's<br/>
I love Cali like I love women<br/>
'Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in him<br/>
We might fight amongst each other<br/>
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down<br/>
Get us pissed, to live and die in L.A.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Val Young (2Pac):]</i><br/>
(My angel sing)<br/>
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be<br/>
(And the angels go)<br/>
You've got to be there to know it<br/>
When everybody wanna see<br/>
(To live and die in L.A.)<br/>
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be<br/>
You've got to be there to know it<br/>
When everybody wanna see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans<br/>
Black love, brown pride, and the sets again<br/>
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke<br/>
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe<br/>
Remember K-day? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?<br/>
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way<br/>
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood!<br/>
But recognize and it's all good<br/>
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out<br/>
Snoop Dogg in this mothafucka permed out<br/>
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn<br/>
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn<br/>
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B.<br/>
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me<br/>
Neckbone, Tray, Heron, Big Buntry too<br/>
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you<br/>
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay<br/>
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Val Young (2Pac):]</i><br/>
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be<br/>
(Let my angel sing)<br/>
You've got to be there to know it<br/>
When everybody wanna see<br/>
(And my angels go)<br/>
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be<br/>
(To live and die in L.A.)<br/>
You've got to be there to know it<br/>
When everybody wanna see<br/>
(Let my angel sing)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
This go out for 92.3, and 106<br/>
All the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit<br/>
Makin' my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum<br/>
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)<br/>
This go out to all the magazines that support a nigga<br/>
All the real motherfuckers<br/>
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)<br/>
All the stores, the mom and pop spots<br/>
A&amp;R people, all y'all mothafuckers<br/>
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)<br/>
L.A., "California Love" part mothafuckin' two<br/>
Without gay ass Dre<br/>
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
