Ma-ah-an, it ain't easy<br/>
They got me goin cold-hearted<br/>
Probation, violation, incarceration<br/>
Frustration, you know<br/>
Fuck that, nigga damn near bouts to start basin<br/>
It's hard! Hard on a nigga<br/>
<i>[Coughing]</i><br/>
Hard on a nigga (yeah it is, yeah it is)<br/>
<i>[Whispered]</i> Kill kill kill, murder murder murder<br/>
Watch out nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Now tell me do you see<br/>
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin like a G<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2 throughout: Tupac]</i><br/>
Daz in this motherfucker<br/>
Alright bwoy, drop that shit<br/>
Whassup man? Always listen to that shit?<br/>
That ole criminal shit? Peep game nigga, peep game, feel me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Travel through my mind am I blind it's a shame<br/>
Young niggaz gettin murdered straight took out the game<br/>
As I sit here puffin on a cigarette<br/>
Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin on a niggaz death<br/>
These are the rough times, best to hurry up<br/>
And duck muhfucker 'fore I buck mine<br/>
It's gettin crazy and everybody's strapped<br/>
Surrounded by niggaz but nam motherfucker down to watch my back<br/>
These are the bitch made niggaz, you been played nigga<br/>
While you starvin and broke they pullin six figures<br/>
Oooh, what can you do<br/>
When you can't trust your crew, time to bust out the twenty-two<br/>
Boo-yaow! Ran out of weed, so I'm sippin<br/>
On this Hennesey, tell me, do you feel me?<br/>
Heyyy, I have no remorse<br/>
As I take another sip of my liquor and spit my sick thoughts, oooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Thuggin to the fullest, got my strap, I'm a pull it<br/>
On the first muhfucker that can outrun a bullet<br/>
These some Thug Life niggaz, them done like triggers<br/>
Got these punk wannabes and they jockin like bitches<br/>
Now my riches is gettin hoe-zone, it's on<br/>
Fuck a mystery, do you wanna get with me, then let's bone<br/>
I'm a take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin that spinach<br/>
And stayin strong to the finish and then I ride out<br/>
See you on the freeway, sorry baby<br/>
But I gotta call my homey see what he say<br/>
I ain't got no time, I gotta get mine<br/>
I keep my mind on my loot, I'll shoot everytime<br/>
And ain't no way I'm a let bitch made nigga worry me<br/>
Catch me slippin, empty the clip and bury me<br/>
Hell nah nigga have to plug me twice<br/>
Ain't no slippin when you Thug for Life, motherfucker can you see?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Never bow down let these other bitches crawl<br/>
I'm a Thug motherfucker and these Thugs only ball<br/>
Ain't no half steppin here, from the cradle to the grave<br/>
I'm a muhfuckin fool, but I choose to get paid<br/>
Now my pockets gettin empty, and I'm panicked in a fright<br/>
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin tonight<br/>
Ain't nobody livin safe, got a Glock, and I'm stressin<br/>
All I want is my muhfuckin money, ain't no question<br/>
Don't try to stall little trick, cause we hit<br/>
So bring in the scissors and get to clippin that dick<br/>
I'd rather die young than die old and broke<br/>
That's why I stay drunk, and I constantly smoke<br/>
My memories as a youngsta, hangin with the homies<br/>
But now I'm doin bad and them bitches don't know me (Who? Who?)<br/>
But playa haters can't fade me (Why?)<br/>
Cause this is Thug Life nigga and we're crazy, tell me do you see?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
Yeah, constantly runnin from danger ain't no stranger to cop cars<br/>
Gettin arrested and tested wearin a vest and don't drop my guards<br/>
My life is hectic my homies send mail from jail<br/>
Niggaz in Hell got some horrible stories to tell<br/>
I'm catchin cases and still tryin to stack a grip<br/>
The IRS is tryin to stress off a niggaz shit<br/>
A young nigga never had a prayer to prevail<br/>
And all my peers doin years locked up in jail<br/>
What can I do, stay strapped, get a bigger crew<br/>
And creep around with them Dogg Pound niggaz too<br/>
And now we rich ain't no bitch than can touch us<br/>
And it's a trip, how we clown, when we fuck sluts<br/>
Bust nuts then I cut, that's my new thang<br/>
And motherfuckers got on do-rags<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Can I get paid, can I get paid, can I motherfuckin get paid<br/>
Nigga can work for his money all motherfuckin day and<br/>
Still never see a piece of it, you understand me?<br/>
It's not about the nice guy<br/>
It's bout the hardworkin motherfuckin Thug nigga<br/>
If you ain't a Thug nigga, you ain't really doin nothin<br/>
<i>[Chorus repeats in background]</i><br/>
You ain't really makin nothin<br/>
These motherfuckin po-po's and these pink folks<br/>
Got it all locked up for us to fail<br/>
See how they did O.J., and they doin niggaz like that all day<br/>
So if you don't watch your motherfuckin stack<br/>
Believe me, this could be your last breath...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: to fade]</i>
