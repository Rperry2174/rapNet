<i>[Statements â€” 2pac (Dan Quayle):]</i><br/>
I was raised in this society so there's no way<br/>
You can expect me to be a perfect person cuz I'm a do what I'm a do<br/>
I am still thirsty<br/>
(There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published<br/>
It has no place in our society.)<br/>
They gotta understand me<br/>
(Withdraw on this record.)<br/>
That's how I feel I'm a do whatever I like. I am not a role model
