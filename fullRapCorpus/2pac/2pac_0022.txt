"I got a head, but ain't no screws in it"<br/>
<br/>
Roll up and get swoll up, hold up<br/>
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin dunkin donut?<br/>
I ain't came a long way to get checked<br/>
So give me respect when I get wreck<br/>
Or get your motherfuckin chin checked<br/>
Once again, it's your friend outta Oakland<br/>
Hoping I can rock the shit to get ya open<br/>
Say your looking for some real shit<br/>
Then catch a funkified batch<br/>
Like that!<br/>
Oakland's on the map<br/>
2Pac is on the big screen strivin<br/>
Gotta love a nigga for survivin<br/>
I wear alot of old schools jewels<br/>
Look how the fools drool, ooohh<br/>
Stop lookin at me hard cause you're buffer<br/>
But I'll just buck them bigger motherfuckers<br/>
Turnin men to suckers<br/>
Niggas wanna start a little ruckus<br/>
Better duck cause I'll be poppin' them motherfuckers<br/>
They wanna throw their hands up, that's tight<br/>
Hit em wit my eight, never had shit left, right<br/>
Then hit em wit the uppercut, duck quick<br/>
Shit outta luck, fucked and stuck with that rough shit<br/>
Fuck a pop song, fuck a video, fuck Arsenio, fuck the radio<br/>
Do you hear me though?<br/>
Give a holla to my niggas in the pen<br/>
And my murderous partners wit their Mac 10s<br/>
I represent the real cause I'm ill, G<br/>
Glock cocked the day they kill me<br/>
I'm representin'<br/>
<br/>
Peace to Redman, Treach, Vin Rock, Kay Gee the great one<br/>
Mary J. Blige, Pete Rock and Troy, the late son<br/>
Heavy D, CL Smooth, and Queen Latifah<br/>
Too Short, Tony Toni Tone, LayLaw beat cuts<br/>
Ed, the special motherfucker and the Lover<br/>
The Tribe, A Tribe Called Quest, and Jungle Brothers<br/>
Das EFX, EPMD, and Ice Cube<br/>
House of Pain: funky blunted ass white dudes<br/>
Cypress Hill, yeah, the ill niggas<br/>
Digital Underground: my real niggas<br/>
Raw Fusion, Organized Konfusion<br/>
Wicked and the Mouse Man, Spice 1 and Pooh Man<br/>
TLC, Eric B., Rakim, then Scarface<br/>
Stretch, Maj, K-Low, pumpin the Squad's bass<br/>
Thorough Heads, Poonannynans, The Click<br/>
E-40, The Governor, and Richie Rich<br/>
Young Guns in the house pumpin the flava<br/>
DJ Ditch for their behavior<br/>
Off the head, my freestyle flow<br/>
Just a couple of motherfuckers that I know<br/>
I'm strictly representin <br/>
<br/>
1 motherfucker, 2 motherfucker, 3 motherfuckers<br/>
Damn, who did I forget? <br/>
<br/>
I'm a soulja, daddy was a soulja<br/>
Strong in the struggle<br/>
Must contend so it's on<br/>
Raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers<br/>
Mad motherfuckers<br/>
Never had so we grab from the stacked motherfuckers<br/>
Now they know me, the homies<br/>
Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's<br/>
Ah shit!<br/>
Pulled up in a benzy, snatch<br/>
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail<br/>
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit<br/>
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it<br/>
To get specific: If the shoe fits, then kick it<br/>
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you wit it<br/>
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit<br/>
Now they wanna ban me (Told ya)<br/>
All I wanted to be was a soulja<br/>
Bang bang boogie, it's a stick up<br/>
Quit now, nigga, eat a dick up<br/>
Huh, I'm representin'
