"Niggas!" Yeah... uh...<br/>
"Niggas!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Who's afraid of the punk police?<br/>
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace<br/>
Fuck the law, I'd rather draw than do time<br/>
Don't fuck with mine 'cross the line<br/>
My two 9s go BIYA BIYA when I shoot 'em<br/>
Korean motherfuckers was crooked<br/>
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em<br/>
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas<br/>
...uh, straight take his life<br/>
So don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em<br/>
Empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em<br/>
Licking off shots for Latasha, that's proper<br/>
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers<br/>
So what the fuck you wanna do now?<br/>
I packed a 9 last year, in '99 I'm packing two now<br/>
And even if they pull they triggers<br/>
They can shoot one man, but nothing's gonna stop the plan of true niggas<br/>
<br/>
"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us<br/>
"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas<br/>
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas, ha-ha<br/>
"Niggas!" I was raised in this society so there's no way you can<br/>
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss:]</i> HA! Uh.<br/>
Aiyyo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks<br/>
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots<br/>
Your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?<br/>
Niggas nowadays they worry me<br/>
My bars is therapy, as long as you using 'em thoroughly<br/>
Muah 'til the day that they bury me<br/>
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be<br/>
And I'm a product of the 70s<br/>
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave<br/>
If I ain't eating wit'chu I'm probably beefin wit'chu<br/>
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speaking wit'chu<br/>
I know you got a gun but I'm hoping you keep it wit'chu<br/>
Cause unfortunately I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol and<br/>
Know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath<br/>
Ruff Ryders, D Block, and of course Amaru<br/>
Lot of people honor you, probably cause the way<br/>
That you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to<br/>
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you<br/>
But, anyway, life goes on<br/>
So I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do<br/>
<br/>
"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us<br/>
"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas<br/>
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas, ha-ha<br/>
"Niggas!" I was raised in this society so there's no way you can<br/>
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do<br/>
<br/>
"Niggas!" Nigga! Can't fuck with us
