<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Whassup, boo? Swear I'll never call you bitch again<br/>
You ain't fuck with me<br/>
I swear I'll never call you bitch again<br/>
(All I just wanna say is um, if I fuckin' apologized)<br/>
I swear I'll never call you bitch again<br/>
(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)<br/>
I'll never call you bitch again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Damn â€“ gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence<br/>
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent<br/>
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through<br/>
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too<br/>
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble<br/>
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you<br/>
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues<br/>
Swear I can't live with you<br/>
But without you, every day I miss you<br/>
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you<br/>
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you<br/>
Though not the man of your dreams<br/>
My plan and scheme's to be rich like a king<br/>
And live my life trouble free, I see<br/>
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind<br/>
I promise that I'll change in time<br/>
It's a complicated world so, girl, just be a friend<br/>
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrese (2Pac):]</i><br/>
We came too far to throw it all away<br/>
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)<br/>
We came way too far, pretty baby<br/>
to throw it all away, throw it all away<br/>
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn<br/>
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone<br/>
Tryin' to get my money on strong<br/>
So an early riser out before them other guys<br/>
That's the way to profit every time<br/>
Can't get too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me<br/>
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties<br/>
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me<br/>
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me<br/>
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'<br/>
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'<br/>
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again<br/>
I promise not to leave you on your own again<br/>
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped<br/>
It's so frantic but don't panic, 'cause we crossed the top<br/>
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend<br/>
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrese (2Pac):]</i><br/>
We came too far to throw it all away<br/>
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)<br/>
We came way too far, pretty baby<br/>
To throw it all away, throw it all away<br/>
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>['Pac:]</i><br/>
I know, I know, all that is dead though<br/>
I'm changed, I'm tellin' you<br/>
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time<br/>
To grow up, ya know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
That was way back then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrese:]</i><br/>
You're my nigga, my best friend<br/>
Never gonna call you a bitch again<br/>
Yea yea yea, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through<br/>
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work, boo?<br/>
I know you been feelin' pain, things are not the same<br/>
Waitin' to exhale while I'm sittin' in the county jail<br/>
Keep your head up, 'cause things are gettin' better<br/>
My cellmate shed tears off your last love letter<br/>
Told him you would find a friend, so keep your eyes peeled<br/>
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the sufferin' that I feel<br/>
Who can I trust? And if I bust, will she snitch?<br/>
Even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch<br/>
You showed me the definition of feminine<br/>
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women<br/>
Huh, I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon<br/>
Pictures of us kissin' in the livin' room, in the nude<br/>
Thanks for being there much more than a friend<br/>
I swear I'll never call you bitch again; believe me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrese (2Pac):]</i><br/>
We came too far, to throw it all away<br/>
We came way too far, pretty baby<br/>
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)<br/>
We came too far to throw it all away<br/>
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)<br/>
We came way too far, pretty baby<br/>
To throw it all away, throw it all away baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrese:]</i><br/>
Through all my ups and downs<br/>
You always stayed around stayed around
