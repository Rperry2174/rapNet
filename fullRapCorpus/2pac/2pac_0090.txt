Get money nigga<br/>
Yeah - aw yeah<br/>
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers<br/>
That get up every motherfuckin' mornin' and put they work in<br/>
I see you - I see you boy<br/>
<br/>
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block<br/>
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks<br/>
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked<br/>
Niggas laughed, 'til the first motherfucker got blas-ted<br/>
I put the nigga in his casket<br/>
And now they coverin' the bastard in plastic<br/>
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts<br/>
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce<br/>
Gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hoes<br/>
Got a forty-five screamin' out surviv-al<br/>
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo<br/>
Holla "five-o" when I say so<br/>
Don't wanna go to the Pen', I'm hittin' fences<br/>
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches<br/>
And they say how do you survive, weighin' one-fifty-five<br/>
In the city where the little niggas die<br/>
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me<br/>
They can never take the life of a real G<br/>
<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, get paid nigga<br/>
I gotta get <i>[]</i><br/>
Get paid bwooy (fuck the police)<br/>
Watch out of all this, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'<br/>
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it<br/>
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'<br/>
Kinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'<br/>
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block<br/>
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops<br/>
I'm gettin' high, think I'll die if I don't get no ends<br/>
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz<br/>
I hit the strip I let my music buck<br/>
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck<br/>
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal<br/>
as I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo<br/>
I need money in a major way<br/>
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha hah ha<br/>
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me<br/>
Cause they can never take the game from a young G<br/>
<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah nigga, get paid<br/>
Can't fade me boy (some of my niggas in hometown)<br/>
<i>[?]</i> y'all<br/>
That's how we run the shit in '93 boy<br/>
Fuck them niggas <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do<br/>
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too<br/>
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry<br/>
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die<br/>
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock<br/>
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit<br/>
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain<br/>
at point blank range cause he slept on the game<br/>
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin' the dice<br/>
Now roll 'em if you can't stand pain better hold 'em<br/>
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll<br/>
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold<br/>
You better live ya life to the fullest<br/>
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it<br/>
And even if they kill me<br/>
They can never take the life of a young G<br/>
<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
I'm gettin' money (money)<br/>
Gettin' money (gettin' money)<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' paid nigga (that's right), for my niggas in the hood<br/>
That's right nigga, that's right boy enough for love<br/>
Talk to hold that shit boy <i>[?]</i><br/>
Pass the shit<br/>
Gettin' paid (gettin' paid)
