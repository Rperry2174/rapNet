Damn son, Niggas stay doing it to us son, <br/>
you gone son, Niggas think its a coincidence, <br/>
niggas be stopping us before we even get started, <br/>
This is under attack baby, we going to ride though, watch us son.<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Yo uh yea, see the lying in my eyes when I'm coming for the get back,<br/>
big mac, cock gunfire, hot tires they burning, they got us all dieing and burning, <br/>
they lieing to destroy our earth, little birth diseases, 30 millionth church for Jesus<br/>
and still our young eating out cans, chiefing grams and weapons, I sold my first swam at seven,<br/>
A smidget after first grade, shirt sprayed with talents, you made us hurt make the balance.<br/>
Instead of preaching violence and fear, Silenced shares we moving, The evil go ahead a movement<br/>
Or share me the spiritual form, hear a song rebellion, we gathered up the strong and felons,<br/>
The youth and all the poverty strain and were all the poverty dwelling, The story that the pottery telling<br/>
You find all in potter's field or the government files.<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Dave Duke sure look cute in that black suit Oooohhh<br/>
But even cuter behind the barrel of my six shooter Oh<br/>
You look worried cause I ain't burried<br/>
Punks leave in a hurry cause I throw flurries making mothafuckas, scurry<br/>
Come feel the flavor from my single<br/>
And brain cell's tingle I'm feeling stronger than a fuckin mad Dingo <br/>
and uh How's that for black history?<br/>
I stay strapped, and love to jack those that slang that crack misery Ha<br/>
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas<br/>
But how could you love niggas if you trying drug niggas?<br/>
You motherfuckas need your caps peeled<br/>
Cause when blacks kill blacks we stay trapped and thats, real<br/>
And we don't need no more statistic's<br/>
It's time to get more realistic for the young the black and the gifted<br/>
And uh<br/>
Until my people get uplifted<br/>
There's no popping shit, just popping clips instead of marching we gon' rip<br/>
Shit.<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
Some say the Government will watch me<br/>
But they can't stop me<br/>
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse<br/>
<br/>
yo whoever shot tupac amaru shakur<br/>
will forever be a dead man laying on the floor<br/>
revolutionary thug shit dieing for every young poor black mother in the middle of the ghetto<br/>
we never had a chance to appreciate life<br/>
the government got a plan to eliminate the life <br/>
of every black soul on the slavery land <br/>
and oppositions we abolishing a slavery plan, pay attention every serious political band<br/>
got a division full of killers imperial scams<br/>
they wanna kill us all off and incarcerate the family of anyone opposing the war<br/>
They want us all to appreciate death and believe up in the white god praying to the heavens above.<br/>
Ima never let a devil come separate the adamic covenant, The potter's field criminals coming for the government.
