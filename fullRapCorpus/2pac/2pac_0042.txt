<i>[2Pac (RahRah):]</i><br/>
That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker<br/>
I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)<br/>
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?<br/>
(Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' Outlaw)<br/>
That's right nigga, hahaha. Housin' these hoes, you feel me?<br/>
(Aight, you know what I'm sayin'?)<br/>
You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?<br/>
(Keepin' it real!)<br/>
How old are you nigga?<br/>
(I'm eleven)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state<br/>
Preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate<br/>
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards<br/>
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets<br/>
Who can you blame? It's insane what we been through<br/>
Witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too<br/>
In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'<br/>
Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em<br/>
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of<br/>
and snitches get dealt with, with no love<br/>
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury<br/>
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry<br/>
But never worry, they'll remember me through history<br/>
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a<br/>
<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well<br/>
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell<br/>
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards<br/>
Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket<br/>
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks<br/>
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass<br/>
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?<br/>
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?<br/>
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway<br/>
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh<br/>
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive<br/>
By makin' motherfuckers fry<br/>
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops<br/>
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop<br/>
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire<br/>
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar<br/>
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch<br/>
"Motherfuckers is crooked," is what I scream, and hit the fence<br/>
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens<br/>
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission<br/>
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five<br/>
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a<br/>
<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dramacydal:]</i><br/>
<i>[Kadafi:]</i><br/>
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be<br/>
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's<br/>
I witnessed niggas lose they chest<br/>
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
So I just... swallow my Beck's and holla, "Fuck 'em!"<br/>
And if I'm next... just let a nigga step with somethin'<br/>
I ain't fearin' nuttin'<br/>
<i>[EDI Amin (Kastro):]</i><br/>
Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny<br/>
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me<br/>
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin'<br/>
(now he mashin') Top speed (smokin' weed) laughin' (biotch!)<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killers cry<br/>
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?<br/>
Talkin' 'bout prayin'<br/>
<i>[Kadafi:]</i><br/>
They need to stop, that ain't gon' help<br/>
These niggas sprayin' up my block<br/>
<i>[Napolean:]</i><br/>
Tryin' to take my wealth<br/>
<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)<br/>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge<br/>
Punk police, niggas run the streets<br/>
Hahah, it ain't nuttin' but music<br/>
Shit's changed<br/>
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin REAL strange<br/>
The rules is all rearranged<br/>
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets<br/>
These punk police is crooked as me<br/>
but all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's<br/>
Stop bein' a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga<br/>
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger<br/>
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel<br/>
Cause you know these streets is real ill<br/>
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket<br/>
Jealous, motherfuckin' bastards<br/>
I never die, thug niggas multiply<br/>
Cause after me is Thug Life baby<br/>
Then the young thugs<br/>
Then the youngest thug of all, my nigga RahRah!
