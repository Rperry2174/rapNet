<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Outlaw Immortalz<br/>
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick<br/>
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls<br/>
They know you watchin'<br/>
But you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch<br/>
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings<br/>
Blessed with the gift of speech<br/>
The power to reach<br/>
Each nigga on every street<br/>
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired<br/>
Since the day the seed was planted<br/>
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick<br/>
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit<br/>
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs<br/>
Outlaw Immortalz<br/>
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue<br/>
What lies between is the fiction<br/>
Don't fuck around and make it true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
<i>[*laughing*]</i><br/>
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe<br/>
Out for revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me<br/>
Plus my alias is Makaveli<br/>
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly<br/>
Bust him to see if he bleed<br/>
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me<br/>
They call my name out and niggas run<br/>
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hussein Fatal:]</i><br/>
They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table<br/>
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel<br/>
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil<br/>
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle<br/>
'Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies<br/>
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these<br/>
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast<br/>
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal<br/>
Glistenin' holdin' pistols<br/>
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials<br/>
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential<br/>
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you<br/>
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro<br/>
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes<br/>
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs<br/>
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be<br/>
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'<br/>
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'<br/>
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'<br/>
I think these niggas got the game fucked up<br/>
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)<br/>
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation<br/>
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Thug nigga 'til we die<br/>
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride<br/>
Thug nigga 'til we die<br/>
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mussolini:]</i><br/>
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini<br/>
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me<br/>
Drug warlord, ridin' Concorde jets<br/>
Rag Vette's, shakin' bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets<br/>
Inglewoods banger, keepin' one in the chamber<br/>
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride<br/>
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge<br/>
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I.:]</i><br/>
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy<br/>
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggas easy<br/>
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin' somethin', so I'mma commence<br/>
To dumpin' stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin', Thuggin'<br/>
To my fuckin' last note, with Lo-Pole and Kastro<br/>
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though<br/>
Outlaw Immortalz doin' this dit-nirt on the sli-zow<br/>
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kadafi:]</i><br/>
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy<br/>
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me<br/>
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon<br/>
While beefin' with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'<br/>
Since a shorty I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome<br/>
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'<br/>
It's like it's me against myself with all these<br/>
Backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin' wealth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mo Khomeini:]</i><br/>
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer<br/>
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers<br/>
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks<br/>
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef<br/>
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes<br/>
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes<br/>
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'<br/>
Now I'm surpassin' any assassin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Thug nigga 'til we die<br/>
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride<br/>
Thug nigga 'til we die<br/>
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride<br/>
Thug nigga 'til we die<br/>
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride<br/>
Thug nigga 'til we die<br/>
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
