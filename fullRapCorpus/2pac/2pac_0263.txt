'Cause they're bragging, telling the fuckers in jail yo, we just got pumped woo<br/>
and that's why we don't do it, I know what I'm doing, imma destroy 'em<br/>
<br/>
Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town<br/>
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now<br/>
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz?<br/>
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz<br/>
Am I wrong? Niggaz makin songs, tryin to get with us<br/>
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust<br/>
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come<br/>
shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die<br/>
Heard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch!<br/>
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie<br/>
THEN! We watch the other two die slow<br/>
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow<br/>
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes<br/>
I can't stand you hoes, uhh<br/>
Now label this my fuckin trick shot<br/>
My lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hip-hop<br/>
When we RIDE<br/>
<br/>
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
And still, we try to change the past, in vain<br/>
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed<br/>
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
a man of military means in my artillery<br/>
Watchin over me through every murder scene<br/>
<br/>
Come take a journey through my mind's eye<br/>
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye<br/>
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger<br/>
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes<br/>
You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits<br/>
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention<br/>
Here's a word to those that robbed me<br/>
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me<br/>
Nigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell?<br/>
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell<br/>
How many niggaz wanna be involved?<br/>
See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball<br/>
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed<br/>
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz<br/>
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD<br/>
Know I meant, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN WORD<br/>
<br/>
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
And still, we try to change the past, in vain<br/>
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed<br/>
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
a man of military means in my artillery<br/>
Watchin over me through every murder scene<br/>
<br/>
I really didn't believe until I got shot that no black person would shoot me.<br/>
I was their representative, they would never harm me<br/>
<br/>
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
And still, we try to change the past, in vain<br/>
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed<br/>
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
a man of military means in my artillery<br/>
Watchin over me through every murder scene<br/>
And if I die by slug, the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
And still, we try to change the past, in vain<br/>
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed<br/>
And if I die by slug the death of a true thug<br/>
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me?<br/>
The death of a true thug<br/>
a man of military means in my artillery<br/>
Watchin over me through every murder scene
