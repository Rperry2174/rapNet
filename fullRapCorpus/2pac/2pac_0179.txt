Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep<br/>
Tryin' to diss now too, huh?!<br/>
Hahaha! Well, I ain't prejudiced<br/>
I don't give a fuck<br/>
This is what it sounds like<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
Biatch! When we ride on our enemies<br/>
<br/>
Hey, got some static for some niggas on the other side of town<br/>
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now<br/>
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?<br/>
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas, and slug niggas<br/>
Am I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us<br/>
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust<br/>
To the chest I bust, then we ride 'til the sun come<br/>
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky; how many die?<br/>
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me<br/>
Look, bitch: I'll cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie<br/>
Then, we watch the other two die slow<br/>
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow<br/>
Bam! Set my plan in mo'<br/>
Time to exterminate my foes; I can't stand you hoes<br/>
Uh, now label this my fuckin' trick shot<br/>
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
I bet you motherfuckers die<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
Bet all you motherfuckers die<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
<br/>
Come take a journey through my mind's eye<br/>
You crossed the game, don't explain<br/>
Nigga, time to die; say goodbye<br/>
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger<br/>
So right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga<br/>
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits<br/>
Niggas love to scream "Peace!" after they start some shit<br/>
Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me<br/>
I murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep<br/>
Don't fuck with me!<br/>
Nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?<br/>
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well<br/>
Hell, how many niggas wanna be involved?<br/>
See, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball<br/>
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed<br/>
Fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz<br/>
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD<br/>
Know I meant every motherfuckin' word<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
<br/>
When we ride on our enemies<br/>
Make sure everybody die<br/>
When we ride, on our enemies<br/>
When we ride on our enemies, hehe<br/>
I make sure everybody die<br/>
When we ride, on our enemies
