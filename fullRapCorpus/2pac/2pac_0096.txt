<br/>
Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two<br/>
Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off<br/>
The penitentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail<br/>
Hell I'm makin' more money on the street from here in a cell<br/>
I'm livin' proper, the coppers is havin' fits<br/>
I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin' shit<br/>
I still remember my momma told me<br/>
Find the cop who killed your brother<br/>
Send him to Hell lookin' homely<br/>
Cause a real nigga love the law<br/>
What's raw is a nigga that's above the law<br/>
Keep pressin' your luck and get fucked, huh<br/>
Think a nigga don't know whassup 'cause he's locked up<br/>
But in the meantime, it's get swole get clean time<br/>
Concentrate on gettin' green time<br/>
And as the years go by, they forgot<br/>
About the small time soldier from the block, huh<br/>
To kill the crook they threw the book at me<br/>
Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy<br/>
Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts<br/>
Did push-ups until I swole up<br/>
And then they offer me a furlough<br/>
But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin' five mo'<br/>
They asked me if I changed much<br/>
I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut<br/>
They started askin' me questions about my brother<br/>
And makin' remarks about my mother, hmm<br/>
Wait a minute, hold up<br/>
Makin' jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up<br/>
They sent me back to the hole for what I told em<br/>
I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him<br/>
He went home to find a tragedy<br/>
Nigga, that's what you get for tryin' to badger me<br/>
And anybody else that wanna sweat me<br/>
I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me<br/>
You better pray they never see me<br/>
Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets<br/>
<br/>
When I get free, huh<br/>
When I get free, huh<br/>
When I get free<br/>
<br/>
When I get free, huh<br/>
When I get free, huh<br/>
When I get free<br/>
<br/>
When I get free
