<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
This going out to all the females that be having<br/>
To beat them motherfuckers in they head to get them<br/>
Off of them, Ha-ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin' pictures in hazy vision<br/>
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish<br/>
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses<br/>
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family<br/>
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?<br/>
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?<br/>
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga<br/>
Until the day I go, no broken promises<br/>
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone<br/>
But yet and still I'm hopin'<br/>
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven<br/>
I know it's better in heaven cause bein' here ain't livin'<br/>
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still<br/>
Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies<br/>
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost<br/>
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyon Bryce (2pac):]</i><br/>
Play your cards right baby (ha-ha, play your cards right)<br/>
Play your cards right girl (take ya time)<br/>
Take your time baby (be patient)<br/>
Just be patient baby (don't rush)<br/>
Don't you rush it girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Uh huh, Luda<br/>
You ain't gotta do that baby<br/>
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you playin' your cards<br/>
You got a brother feelin' mellow like a Cuban cigar<br/>
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time<br/>
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind<br/>
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams<br/>
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens<br/>
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands<br/>
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds<br/>
No more livin' like a playa, stop chasin' the hoes<br/>
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole<br/>
I live a life full of riches we got places to go<br/>
So no bluffin', no rushin', just takin' it slow<br/>
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade<br/>
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade<br/>
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl<br/>
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue<br/>
Ha-ha, play your cards right baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyon Bryce (2pac):]</i><br/>
Play your cards right baby (ha-ha, play your cards right)<br/>
Play your cards right girl (take ya time)<br/>
Take your time baby (be patient)<br/>
Just be patient baby (don't rush)<br/>
Don't you rush it girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keon Bryce:]</i><br/>
You're the one, the only one heaven sent for me<br/>
Baby, I'm hopin' that you understand, that you still believe<br/>
That I got the special times, on my mind, just hopin' that you see<br/>
Baby that the thug in me is lovin' you, that this is meant to be<br/>
Girl I'll never leave you alone<br/>
You're the one, the only one heaven sent for me<br/>
Baby, I'm hopin' that you understand, that you still believe<br/>
That I got the special times, on my mind, just hopin' that you see<br/>
Baby that the thug in me is lovin' you, that this is meant to be<br/>
Girl I'll never leave you alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyon Bryce (2pac):]</i><br/>
Play your cards right baby<br/>
