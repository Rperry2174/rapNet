<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Put me in that; ay come on JoJo ('Pac hahaha)<br/>
Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)<br/>
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game<br/>
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same<br/>
Walked in my daddy's shoes<br/>
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools<br/>
That's 'til I put my eyes on you<br/>
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you<br/>
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone<br/>
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on<br/>
Tell me lady how you like me<br/>
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me<br/>
But do it lightly<br/>
Cause that excites me to lay the pipe<br/>
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night<br/>
Only got fucked by a drug dealer<br/>
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)<br/>
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me<br/>
I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me<br/>
So whatchu sayin' girl?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo (2Pac):]</i><br/>
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, give it to me<br/>
I got a lot of thug in me, lot of thug (Maybe it's the thug in me)<br/>
That I wanna put in you (maybe it's the thug in you)<br/>
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, can you check it<br/>
I got a lot of thug in me. Do you want it (Maybe it's the thug in me)<br/>
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Moan baby when we bone it's on<br/>
It's so strong niggas in the next room'll cum<br/>
I got ya head swingin'<br/>
Tongue kissin', as I hit it from the back with the bed ringin' (haha)<br/>
Give me space, as I lick ya face, stick the place<br/>
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass<br/>
Love fuckin' in tha mo'nin'<br/>
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone<br/>
Left you on yo' own girl<br/>
Tell me what you feel like<br/>
Blindfolded, I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
I pull ya hair while we fuckin' in the chair, when ya lovin' me<br/>
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try<br/>
Bet my kiss, to get you high, don't pass by<br/>
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you<br/>
Now open up and let me put the thug in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo (2Pac):]</i><br/>
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, give it to me<br/>
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me), lot of thug<br/>
That I wanna put in you<br/>
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, can you check it<br/>
I got a lot of thug in me, do you want it<br/>
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Say baby what's your phone number?<br/>
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder<br/>
I make the room rumble, in and out long stroke<br/>
Hold ya breath now, close your eyes deep throat<br/>
Did you like it? Oh I'm excited!<br/>
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited<br/>
C'mon now, let me see ya shake your rump<br/>
Tell me, how long will it take to cum<br/>
Havin' fun, do it one on one and we can all get involved<br/>
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all<br/>
When you call me the next day<br/>
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way<br/>
Yeah baby it's a price to pay<br/>
Only play in the fast lane<br/>
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came<br/>
I gotcha goin' wild, 'cause I'm lovin' you<br/>
Drugged out with this motherfuckin' thug in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo (2Pac):]</i><br/>
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you<br/>

<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna talk, I don't want no explanations<br/>
I don't got no motherfuckin' explanations, y'knahmsayin?<br/>
It's the thug in me<br/>
Don't be askin' why I'm pullin' your hair<br/>
And why I fuck so motherfuckin' thuggish<br/>
That thug passion, y'knahmean?<br/>
Bitch, no mercy<br/>
What you scared of?<br/>
Didn't you come over here to get fucked? (no)<br/>
You ain't come over here for me to be<br/>
Strokin', and all that bullshit<br/>
You came over here to get fucked (no)<br/>
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style<br/>
Bitch you'd leave my house talkin' bout, "2Pac can't serve me"<br/>
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha<br/>
Turn over! Maybe it's the thug in me!
