Excuse me sweet heart, do you like?<br/>
Ha ha yeah<br/>
Tongue kissin'<br/>
<br/>
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions<br/>
Givin' me a good taste<br/>
Of the thing's I've been missin'<br/>
Uh<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Listen<br/>
I can tell by the pain in your eyes you've been through so much<br/>
I feel ya' shiver at the slightest touch<br/>
It's like you scared, I might care<br/>
I'll never hurt you or desert you I'll be right there<br/>
Let's come together if you trust me then I can show you<br/>
Don't be shamed, it's the changes that people go through<br/>
Don't be scared of me<br/>
Come close to me please<br/>
I can see upset your mine give you what you need<br/>
Can I proceed?<br/>
Who do you believe in?<br/>
Afraid to leave but to scared that you need him<br/>
Set it free<br/>
I can take you to new places, anticipated it's a parade of new faces<br/>
Gettin' hotter now calm down get a grip<br/>
Slow baby ain't no need for rushin' this<br/>
I touch your lips<br/>
And give you kisses that you won't forget<br/>
Soft and wet<br/>
On your mark, get ready, set<br/>
<br/>
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions<br/>
Givin' me a good taste<br/>
Of the thing's I've been missin'<br/>
Uh<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I wanna take you home<br/>
We can sleep alone as I whisper in your ear<br/>
Disappear to a different zone<br/>
Promise not to move to fast<br/>
I got time, rather have some conversation's<br/>
Drop lines<br/>
Can ya hear me?<br/>
Tell me if you move, in my groove<br/>
Would you do what I ask you to?<br/>
See I love to make you moan your erogenous zone<br/>
Any a brother in his right mind love to spend some time at home<br/>
Though your hurtin' I can feel your pain<br/>
Try to understand, we ain't all the same<br/>
Let me take you away<br/>
Can you leave, some place<br/>
To find true peace?<br/>
Let me be your lover, a positive<br/>
Take your mind off the times<br/>
Of fucking, with the wrong nigga<br/>
<br/>
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions<br/>
Givin' me a good taste<br/>
Of the thing's I've been missin'<br/>
Uh<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I can't breathe, believe when times are low<br/>
It's like agony when I'm at home<br/>
Heart beatin' at a fast rate<br/>
Makin' moves in the nude I imaging it's the moves that your ass make<br/>
Don't be shy, I can't lie, pictures of me, inside you<br/>
On so bad I could die<br/>
I've been possessed so obsessed to undress you<br/>
No disrespect but my aim is to sex you<br/>
After that<br/>
Live your life as my wife at times<br/>
You'll understand how I had to live a life of crimes<br/>
Come let me put my hands on your<br/>
Hips and move<br/>
What your head do?<br/>
Bobbin' as we flip the mood<br/>
Give me good lovin' time to please<br/>
In and out, up and down<br/>
As we grind and freeze<br/>
Put your back in the the motion and caress a figure<br/>
Make her shamed<br/>
For fucking with the wrong nigga<br/>
<br/>
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions<br/>
Givin' me a good taste<br/>
Of the thing's I've been missin'<br/>
Uh<br/>
<i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Right there, uh)<br/>
Tongue kissin'<br/>
(Oh don't move, right there, uh)<br/>
Uh, tongue kissin'<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
Tongue kissin'
