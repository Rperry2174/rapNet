<i>[*"To Live &amp; Die in L.A." fades out*]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snipped of a religious TV show:]</i><br/>
God has a plan, and the Bible unfolds that wonderful plan through the message of prophecy<br/>
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior and that Christ is returning someday soon To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity<br/>
For my life and your life<br/>
As long as we're cooperating with God by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days<br/>
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!<br/>
Makaveli, the new breed<br/>
And I remember what my pops told me<br/>
The new word, follow me<br/>
Remember what my pops told me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers<br/>
Strugglin', known to hustle screaming, "Fuck they feelings!"<br/>
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this<br/>
Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!<br/>
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two<br/>
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do<br/>
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.<br/>
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy<br/>
Now rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies<br/>
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies<br/>
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled<br/>
Picture jewels being handed to an innocent child<br/>
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules<br/>
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules<br/>
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall<br/>
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls<br/>
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right<br/>
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight<br/>
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn<br/>
Ain't nothing free, get back what you earned<br/>
No doubt, getting higher than a motherfucker, bless me please<br/>
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah<br/>
<br/>
And I remember what my papa told me<br/>
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prince Ital Joe (2Pac):]</i><br/>
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord<br/>
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud<br/>
(Remember what my pops told me)<br/>
Using the name of the lord in vain (blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)<br/>
(Remember what my pops told me)<br/>
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowing<br/>
Everybody kissing ass to go to Heaven ain't going<br/>
Put my soul on it, I'm fighting devil niggas daily<br/>
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severely<br/>
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin<br/>
We got evicted had to leave the 'burbs, back in the ghetto<br/>
Doing wild shit, looking at the sun, don't pay<br/>
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day<br/>
They say Moses split the Red Sea<br/>
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up deadly<br/>
Babylon beware, coming for the Pharoah's kids<br/>
Retaliation, making legends off the shit we did<br/>
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waiting for signs<br/>
God coming, she's just taking her time (haha)<br/>
Living by the Nile while the water flow<br/>
I'm contemplating plots wondering where the thought'll go<br/>
Brothas getting shot, coming back resurrected<br/>
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)<br/>
<br/>
And I remember what my papa told me<br/>
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prince Ital Joe (2Pac):]</i><br/>
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord<br/>
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud<br/>
(Remember what my pops told me)<br/>
Using the name of the lord in vain<br/>
(Remember what my pops told me)<br/>
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain<br/>
(what!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
The preacher want me buried, why? Cause I know he a liar<br/>
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire<br/>
Why you got these kids' minds thinking that they evil?<br/>
While the preacher being freaky you say "honor God's people"<br/>
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request<br/>
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X<br/>
Mama, tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop?<br/>
Waiting to beat my ass if I don't go pop?<br/>
Memories of a past time, giving up cash to the leaders<br/>
Knowing damn well they ain't gonna feed us<br/>
In my brain how can you explain time in B.C<br/>
It's hard enough to live now in these times of greed<br/>
They say Jesus is a kind man<br/>
Well, he should understand times in this crime land<br/>
My Thug nation, do what you gotta do, but know you gotta change. Try to find a way to make it out the game<br/>
I leave this, and hope God can see my heart is pure<br/>
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here<br/>
I leave this, and hope God see my heart is pure<br/>
Is Heaven just another door? And my people sayâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prince Ital Joe (2Pac):]</i><br/>
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord<br/>
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud<br/>
(Remember what my pops told me)<br/>
Using the name of the lord in vain<br/>
(Can't I remember what my pops told me, blasphemy)<br/>
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain<br/>
<br/>
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord<br/>
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud<br/>
Using the name of the lord in vain<br/>

Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud<br/>

<br/>
Our father, who art in heaven<br/>
Hallow be thy name<br/>
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done<br/>
In Earth as it is in Heaven<br/>
Give us this day, our daily bread<br/>
As we give up our debts<br/>
As we forgive our debt-ors<br/>
Lead us not into temptation<br/>
But deliver us unevil<br/>
For God is the kingdom and the power<br/>
And the glory forever and ever and ever
