When thugs cry<br/>
Now I lay me down to sleep<br/>
I pray the Lord my guns to keep<br/>
If I die before I wake<br/>
I pray the Lord my soul to take<br/>
Got us dyin'<br/>
When thugs cry, times is hard<br/>
<br/>
Born thuggin', and lovin' the way I came up<br/>
Big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts<br/>
My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity<br/>
They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family<br/>
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried<br/>
I got a line on the D.A. 'cause I'm fuckin' his secretary<br/>
I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all<br/>
They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all<br/>
I'll probably be an old man before I understand<br/>
Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand<br/>
Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad<br/>
They even raped her, so we blazed they pad<br/>
Automatic shots rang out, on every block<br/>
They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops<br/>
I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams<br/>
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin'<br/>
What is the meanin' when thugs cry?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singer (2Pac):]</i><br/>
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?<br/>
In the streets of chalk where they lie<br/>
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God (when thugs cry)<br/>
Oh my, does it have to be this way?<br/>
Our children of today won't stay wise<br/>
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'<br/>
Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug<br/>
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary<br/>
Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries<br/>
But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel<br/>
To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?<br/>
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone<br/>
Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone<br/>
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song<br/>
To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone<br/>
We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches<br/>
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches<br/>
But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange<br/>
Lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne<br/>
See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie<br/>
See, you gotta get high or die, 'cause even thugs cry<br/>
<br/>
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?<br/>
In the streets of chalk where they lie<br/>
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God<br/>
Oh my, does it have to be this way?<br/>
Our children of today won't stay wise<br/>
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?<br/>
<br/>
And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures<br/>
Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures<br/>
'Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don<br/>
I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone<br/>
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?<br/>
So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams<br/>
Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood<br/>
Clownin', takin' pictures later<br/>
Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches<br/>
Regulate my area, the terror I represent<br/>
Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went<br/>
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?<br/>
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told<br/>
Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!<br/>
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long<br/>
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?<br/>
I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry<br/>
<br/>
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?<br/>
In the streets of chalk where they lie<br/>
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God<br/>
Oh my, does it have to be this way?<br/>
Our children of today won't stay wise<br/>
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?<br/>
In the streets of chalk where they lie<br/>
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God<br/>
Oh my, does it have to be this way?<br/>
Our children of today won't stay wise<br/>
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?<br/>
<br/>
I shed tattooed tears for years<br/>
For my dead homeboys and my prison peers<br/>
Y'all ain't never heard my cries<br/>
Now you wonder why would you die?
