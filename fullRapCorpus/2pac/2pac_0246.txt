<i>[2Pac talking:]</i><br/>
You motherfuckers kill me<br/>
Why yall niggas don't ever talk that shit when we be in the physical form?<br/>
Why yall niggas get all shy when we right there next to you at the premiere's and shit?<br/>
Hahaha<br/>
Yall niggas get a lot of heart when you get in the studio, huh?<br/>
Get that can the man motherfucker wanna talk shit on the mic<br/>
Well do this for me, would you?<br/>
Next time you get the notion to talk some shit about an Outlaw nigga<br/>
or a nigga from the west side the best side, call me<br/>
Call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga, cause uh<br/>
If you don't do that and I hear one of you niggas saying something on a record, ha<br/>
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back<br/>
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[*Beat starts*]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Ah, from the pressure, yeah<br/>
You know how we do this Quik, Outlaws, untouchable<br/>
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain<br/>
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again<br/>
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to<br/>
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em<br/>
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living<br/>
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us<br/>
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)<br/>
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place<br/>
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost<br/>
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?<br/>
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds <br/>
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally<br/>
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation<br/>
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em<br/>
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em<br/>
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through<br/>
Outlaws busting while we rushing<br/>
We untouchable<br/>
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through<br/>
We Outlawz rushing you busting you<br/>
We untouchable<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gravy:]</i><br/>
Aiyyo we won't stop, I let the '44 pop<br/>
Tanqueray and Alize' make niggas get shot<br/>
I'm smoking on some kush baby, you know it's all Gravy<br/>
Calicos, AKs, nigga's yellin' mayday<br/>
Payday, soon as the red dots connect<br/>
Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky<br/>
Strictly 2-1-3, 8-1-8, 3-2-3<br/>
3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Yaki Kadafi:]</i><br/>
I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'<br/>
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues<br/>
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin' drama<br/>
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros<br/>
Mashin' like piranhas or a pack of pitts<br/>
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick<br/>
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much<br/>
And a lust for these guns to bust<br/>
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser<br/>
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through<br/>
Outlaws busting while we rushing<br/>
We untouchable<br/>
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through<br/>
We Outlawz rushing you busting you<br/>
We untouchable<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hussein Fatal:]</i><br/>
I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard<br/>
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard<br/>
I rep my Outlaws deeply<br/>
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me<br/>
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don<br/>
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong<br/>
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G<br/>
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost<br/>
The homie 'Pac told me, "I can guarantee you a boss."<br/>
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life<br/>
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it<br/>
But still struggling like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew<br/>
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider<br/>
Got every homie trigger finger under the set<br/>
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect<br/>
<br/>

Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through<br/>
Outlaws busting while we rushing<br/>
We untouchable<br/>
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through<br/>
We Outlawz rushing you busting you<br/>
We untouchable<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through<br/>
Outlawz! We untouchable!
