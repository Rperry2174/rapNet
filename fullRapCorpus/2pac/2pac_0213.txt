<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
As real as it seems the American Dream<br/>
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes<br/>
To get us locked up shot up back in chains<br/>
To deny us of the future rob our names<br/>
Kept my history of mystery but now I see<br/>
The American Dream wasn't meant for me<br/>
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me<br/>
Promised me freedom, education, equality<br/>
Never gave me nothing but slavery<br/>
And now look at how dangerous you made me<br/>
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold<br/>
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told<br/>
Promised me emancipation in this new nation<br/>
All you ever gave my people was starvation<br/>
Fathers of our country never cared for me<br/>
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery<br/>
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me<br/>
Except lie about the facts in my history<br/>
So now I'm sitting here mad cause I'm unemployed<br/>
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed<br/>
When my people are down so they can screw us around<br/>
Time to change the government now panther power<br/>
<br/>
Panther power<br/>
Panther power<br/>
Panther power<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ray Luv:]</i><br/>
Coming straight that resides within<br/>
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win<br/>
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest<br/>
The rich get richer and the poor take less<br/>
The American Dream was an American nightmare<br/>
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair<br/>
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out<br/>
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed<br/>
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom<br/>
But now were impatient<br/>
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs<br/>
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out<br/>
"Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are<br/>
It's ya panther power that makes you a star"<br/>
Panther power<br/>
<br/>
Panther power<br/>
Panther power<br/>
Panther power<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
My Mother never let me forget my history<br/>
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me<br/>
Wanted to be more than just free<br/>
Had to know the true facts about my history<br/>
I couldn't settle for being a statistic<br/>
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic<br/>
Government cause it was meant to hold us back<br/>
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack<br/>
In my community, they killed the unity<br/>
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity<br/>
I strike America like a case of heart disease<br/>
Panther power is running through my arteries<br/>
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death<br/>
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath<br/>
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?<br/>
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you<br/>
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains<br/>
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name<br/>
'Cause some time has passed seem you all forget<br/>
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet<br/>
Panther power<br/>
<br/>
Panther power<br/>
Panther power<br/>
Panther power<br/>
<br/>

All you gave my people was our patience<br/>
