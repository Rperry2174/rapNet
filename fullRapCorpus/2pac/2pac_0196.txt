<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
And my niggas say <br/>
We want the fame!<br/>
Come on! Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
One thing we all adore <br/>
Something worth dyin' for<br/>
Nothin' but pain<br/>
Stuck in this game <br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's<br/>
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed<br/>
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted<br/>
My revenge to increase my ends; enemies gettin' dropped<br/>
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true<br/>
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you<br/>
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame<br/>
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?<br/>
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times<br/>
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time<br/>
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse<br/>
I know, Death follows me, but I'll murder him first<br/>
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless<br/>
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?<br/>
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses<br/>
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask<br/>
I'm the first one to want him blasted<br/>
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit<br/>
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me<br/>
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fakin' fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Yaki Kadafi:]</i><br/>
Block run and shoot slugs <br/>
We throw them back like hardballs <br/>
Without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes<br/>
And thugs I bleed to envy <br/>
Smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' Henny<br/>
Drunk nights, and hot days<br/>
Cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways<br/>
A wife on the run, full of common blunts<br/>
Unconditionally married to my gun<br/>
Fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires<br/>
Be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance<br/>
Searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
One thing we all adore<br/>
Something worth dyin' for<br/>
Nothin' but pain<br/>
Stuck in this game<br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame<br/>
One thing we all adore<br/>
Something worth dyin' for<br/>
Nothin' but pain<br/>
Stuck in this game<br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble:]</i><br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain<br/>
A lost of the game, with life the cost of the game<br/>
We forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain<br/>
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain<br/>
That we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain<br/>
And if I ever lose, homie, bet I'm at it again<br/>
Outlaws don't die, so united we stand<br/>
And if family come before, all the fortune and fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
As I walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head<br/>
Say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed<br/>
Hope they bless me the righteous way <br/>
Got a homie locked down outta town, I sent him a kite today<br/>
Man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg<br/>
Prayin' for my downfall, and I can sense it, dawg<br/>
I was passed down the street fame <br/>
Like Glocks clocked and keep aim<br/>
Was raised up with a clock box <br/>
And I ran with the local street gang <br/>
They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark<br/>
You can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart<br/>
And that's some game that I got from generation of game<br/>
In the road of life, dog<br/>
We need to switch up lanes – think about it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
One thing we all adore<br/>
Something worth dyin' for<br/>
Nothin' but pain<br/>
Stuck in this game<br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame<br/>
One thing we all adore<br/>
Something worth dyin' for<br/>
Been nothin' but pain<br/>
Stuck in this game<br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bad Azz:]</i><br/>
I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame<br/>
It won't change me, now I've got this piece of change<br/>
I feel strange, I got so used to the hood<br/>
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good<br/>
I was just a baby, still retarded from slavery<br/>
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me<br/>
Ghetto ain't made me, I made myself<br/>
Poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help<br/>
I pray for my health, my mind, and my family too<br/>
State of myself, my grind, and my family crew<br/>
Where one hand washes the other<br/>
No, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers<br/>
The struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build<br/>
And that remains the same 'til the day that we killed<br/>
And that's real, life that I was aimed to be<br/>
Love by my family tree, that's fame to me – how about it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
One thing we all adore<br/>
Something worth dyin' for<br/>
Nothin' but pain<br/>
Stuck in this game<br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame<br/>
One thing we all adore<br/>
Something worth dyin' for<br/>
Nothin' but pain<br/>
Stuck in this game <br/>
Searchin' for fortune and fame
