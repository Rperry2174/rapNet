'Cause I hate to spend<br/>
My life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
(Lost soul)<br/>
How it start, how it start<br/>
<br/>
Started off with runnin' from cops duck and hide from helicopters<br/>
We open fire, who can stop us<br/>
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers<br/>
Gettin' twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us<br/>
<br/>
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin' to get us<br/>
ATF state feds scandalous bitches<br/>
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet<br/>
See if a, nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat<br/>
<br/>
Only streets livin' do or die circle complete<br/>
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese<br/>
Please understand my history a man of many acts<br/>
Live a thug life, comin' equipped, with many gats<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time<br/>
Livin' in between life and the cracks were blind<br/>
Even though we had hopes for dreams that never came<br/>
Yet still we all feel pain<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time, stranded in the county in the worst way<br/>
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday<br/>
<br/>
Born in the ghetto as a street thug<br/>
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love<br/>
Lost souls, lost souls, nigga for my homeboys that passed on<br/>
Words from the mind of a lost soul<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
<br/>
My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with<br/>
A three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive<br/>
He taught me the rules so much, but still in thugs I trust<br/>
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin' trap shut<br/>
<br/>
My mom dukes got a little bit of thug in her<br/>
The devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer<br/>
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin' over<br/>
Never stayin' sober, the brain over and over backtrack<br/>
<br/>
My stack's fat, I used to take down new<br/>
One love to my crew aiyyo this one's for you<br/>
R.I.P., rest in peace to Moo Brown<br/>
Know what we gotta do, baby one time<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
One time, one time, one time<br/>
<br/>
I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday<br/>
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate<br/>
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb<br/>
Heroin bein' consumed already predicitin' my doom, soon<br/>
<br/>
To be one of the many misguided<br/>
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it<br/>
Lost before I had a chance to find my way<br/>
Now I travel through life, not knowin' the time of day<br/>
<br/>
Crime for pay, I'm on my way but don't know, where I'm a end up<br/>
I swear to God, this is a setup<br/>
And these are the words from the mind of a lost soul<br/>
(I'm a lost soul)<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine<br/>
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life<br/>
Duckin' one time<br/>
<br/>
All of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell<br/>
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell<br/>
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself<br/>
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell<br/>
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself<br/>
<br/>
For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in hell<br/>
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself<br/>
For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in hell<br/>
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself<br/>
For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in hell<br/>
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself<br/>
<br/>
Throw your hands up<br/>
Throw your hands up<br/>
Throw your hands up<br/>
Throw your hands up
