<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
No man seperate what we create<br/>
Unstoppable, untouchable, motherfuckin' worldwide mob figures<br/>
Death Row at it's finest!<br/>
M.O.B., thug for motherfuckin' life<br/>
Motherfuckin' made niggaz<br/>
We comin after these niggaz, worldwide<br/>
Feel me! Makaveli the Don<br/>
<br/>
My life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug<br/>
House full of babies cryin' from my lack of gettin love<br/>
Ain't nobody tell me shit, 'til I got a sack of drugs<br/>
Had the block sewn up, cause I learned to pack a gun, do you feel me?<br/>
World do ya hear me? Catch a risin' star<br/>
Fuck the love, niggaz fear me<br/>
Got these niggaz runnin' all wild from my double-I<br/>
When we ride motherfuckers is sho' to die<br/>
Boom once I enter the room, in the air<br/>
All you hear is the whispers of doom, niggaz scared<br/>
They don't wanna see me head on...<br/>
Think of all the busters that I had to leave dead and gone<br/>
Call a grave digga, fuckin' with a made nigga, M.O.B.<br/>
Gunfire gettin' sprayed quicker...<br/>
Fuck 'em all let 'em understand my plot to get richer<br/>
Much more than six figures, a motherfuckin' made nigga<br/>
(Can you feel me?)<br/>
A motherfuckin' made nigga...<br/>
I got a plot to get richer, take my picture<br/>
A made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napolean:]</i><br/>
Nigga I was raised on the streets, I had to hustle just to eat<br/>
My role model was killin' niggaz so I know, I would never be weak<br/>
They got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins<br/>
These niggaz crossed my father, then my father crossed them<br/>
Cause I roll with Immortal Thug niggaz<br/>
And my number one plan to kill a man to grab a needle and drug niggaz<br/>
Niggaz don't like us because they bitches straight love us<br/>
The President told us to leave, cause the government don't want us<br/>
It's Napolean, I get my pleasure out of sin<br/>
And seein blood spill ain't shit cause I seen it at the beginnin'<br/>
A made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fatal Hussein:]</i><br/>
How many niggaz fall in ya vision?<br/>
Gunnin 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison<br/>
We mash together, plus we get cash together<br/>
Blast whenever knowin' it don't last forever<br/>
It's only one way out and one way in<br/>
Motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men<br/>
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot<br/>
Blow the roof off them groups like <i>[?]</i> Rachmel Raouf <i>[?]</i><br/>
I can't be touched cause of the weapons I clutch<br/>
And the niggaz that I'm under, is just too much<br/>
We made niggaz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I. Mean:]</i><br/>
Picture the scenery cause for now you gonna have to imagine<br/>
Call me a prophet cause I predicted what's gonna happen<br/>
I began the paper, stackin at those<br/>
Who be paper snatchin', will emerge like crack in the 80's<br/>
Baby, maybe, that's if I slip<br/>
But I became official since the start of this, Edi Amin<br/>
Born July, 7th a few shed eyes<br/>
Precious but others gave me they hate, to cherish<br/>
But still I made it, a made nigga made by the game<br/>
Made for war, my aim is simple and plain<br/>
Yeah, whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain<br/>
You'll forever know my name, Edi a made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
I ain't count the line, my strap, my head,<br/>
There will be none of that<br/>
The young hog Kato playin' Outlaw Immortal combat<br/>
With the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga<br/>
Til he still and chill, recognize the real deal<br/>
Feel - a nigga made when I was young and dumb<br/>
With a gun but it pays so I'm bustin' for fun<br/>
And the outcome will be the same every time<br/>
We all gon' die, get yours cause I'm a get mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Khadafi:]</i><br/>
Tha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit<br/>
Rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public<br/>
With my mentality of war, dead bodies and silence give it to ya raw<br/>
Thug nigga to the core<br/>
The results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level<br/>
Shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin crazed devil<br/>
Mash shit from here to there day by day, year to year<br/>
Made niggaz on ya motherfuckin' team, I'm a made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Ha ha ha... Call me a Bad Boy killer murder motherfuckers daily<br/>
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli<br/>
Gettin' lessons from niggaz at penitentiaries<br/>
Game, when applied help me survive several centuries<br/>
Lock me in a cage I'll display my rage<br/>
Surround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray<br/>
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced<br/>
On my knees to God, beggin for repentence<br/>
I'm convinced, that I'm a thug<br/>
They got me fiendin for my cash like a fiend when he dreams of drugs<br/>
Diss Kidada and I'll kidnap your daughter<br/>
Kill your wife and hit the funeral and tell you just who gave the order<br/>
Makaveli the Don, til I'm gone, I maintain<br/>
My army of lunatics that stay armed<br/>
Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga<br/>
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Can you feel me? Come closer, ha ha ha<br/>
Get into the mind of a made nigga<br/>
I can't be touched<br/>
My adversaries, get fucked, feel me?<br/>
Multimillionaire dreams, all I want is the C.R.E.A.M.<br/>
I sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream<br/>
Come and see, to see a made nigga<br/>
Outlawz... Makaveli The Don<br/>
Hussein Fatal, E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, Napolean, Khadafi...<br/>
Mussolini, M.O.B. I send this out to my niggaz on the streets<br/>
The motherfuckin' made Niggaz<br/>
All my niggas on Death Row, Tha Dogg Pound<br/>
Tha Doggfather, and all his niggaz<br/>
You know what time it is, Daz Dillinger<br/>
Kurupt, Young Gotti... (Hahaha, Westside made niggaz BEOTCH!)
