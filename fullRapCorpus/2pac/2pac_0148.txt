Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
<br/>
The plan, to take command of the whole family<br/>
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned<br/>
All my road dogs, official mob figures<br/>
Love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas<br/>
I can be lost in my own mind<br/>
To be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome 9's<br/>
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories<br/>
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy<br/>
Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash<br/>
Screamin' "Fuck the police!" as I ride through the night streets<br/>
Little child runnin' wild, towards danger<br/>
What's the cause? Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers<br/>
Maybe I'm a madman<br/>
A pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman<br/>
Promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder<br/>
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing + 2Pac:]</i><br/>
Thug for Life, I will be<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
A life of crime I will lead<br/>
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
If you play the game, you play to win<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
It's a crazy world full of sin<br/>
Close your eyes…<br/>
<br/>
Completely lost, revenge at all costs<br/>
Payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed<br/>
Tossed up and never to be heard of<br/>
A single witness screamin', "Bloody murder, murder!"<br/>
Blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?<br/>
A blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town<br/>
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro<br/>
Homie had to blast on the task force<br/>
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that<br/>
They took my money and my stash; time to get 'em back<br/>
Upon my secret arrival<br/>
Two glock four-fives, time for survival<br/>
Death to my rivals, tell me, what you want, Lord?<br/>
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord<br/>
The situation's critical<br/>
Nothing is colder, than hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing + 2Pac:]</i><br/>
Thug for Life, I will be<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
A life of crime I will lead<br/>
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
If you play the game, you play to win<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
It's a crazy world full of sin<br/>
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
<br/>
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon<br/>
When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out, BOOM!<br/>
Who wanna see me in a challenge?<br/>
So merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads<br/>
Do you feel me? Capo or Capi-tan<br/>
One day I'll be the Don; until then, remain strong<br/>
My only fear of death is reincarnation<br/>
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient<br/>
To all my niggas facin' 60 years<br/>
Sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier<br/>
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game<br/>
For all my homies that'll never be alive again<br/>
All they promise us is death, nigga<br/>
Take a breath, come be the last one left, nigga<br/>
It's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nuttin colder<br/>
Listen, you can hear it – the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing + 2Pac:]</i><br/>
Thug for Life, I will be<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
A life of crime I will lead<br/>
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
If you play the game, you play to win<br/>
This is the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
It's a crazy world full of sin<br/>
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier<br/>
<br/>
This go out to Kato, Mental, all the niggas that passed away<br/>
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku – all the down-ass riders<br/>
All the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers<br/>
All the niggas that go through that day-to-day struggle<br/>
(This is the ballad of a dead soldier!)<br/>
All the niggas that passed on<br/>
All the niggas with ambition and money in they heart<br/>
All the niggas that want some and that don't take none<br/>
Hahaha (It's the ballad of a dead soldier!)<br/>
The police are so scared of us<br/>
All the feds they aware of us<br/>
They wanna see us dead<br/>
They got pictures of a nigga head, (Ballad of a dead soldier!)<br/>
Tryin' to see me in chains, shit<br/>
Them niggas'll never breathe again<br/>
Before they put me in a cell, they'll see me in Hell<br/>
('Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)<br/>
Got my pistols cocked<br/>
Run the whole motherfuckin' block; fuck the cops!<br/>
The police? We run these streets, nigga<br/>
(Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!)<br/>
These niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me<br/>
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair<br/>
But nigga, you know – it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
