<i>[George Clinton:]</i><br/>
The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes<br/>
Looking hard, but won't realize<br/>
That they will never see the P!<br/>
You must be goin' blind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Give me my money in stacks<br/>
And lace my bitches with dime figures<br/>
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers<br/>
Must see my enemies defeated<br/>
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded<br/>
Open fire, now them niggas bleeding<br/>
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown<br/>
Straight out the west, don't get blown<br/>
My adversaries cry like hoes<br/>
Open and shut like doors<br/>
Is you a friend or foe?<br/>
Nigga, you ain't know?<br/>
They got me stressed out on Death Row<br/>
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'<br/>
You screaming: "Go 2Pac!" and I ain't stopping 'til I'm well-paid<br/>
Bail's paid now nigga look what hell made<br/>
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire<br/>
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die<br/>
Ask me why I'm a boss player, getting high<br/>
And when I'm rolling by niggas can't see me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[George Clinton:]</i><br/>
The stares of a million pairs of eyes<br/>
And you'll never realize<br/>
You can't see me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Been getting word that these square motherfuckers with nerves<br/>
Saying they can get with us, but picture me getting served<br/>
My own mama say I'm thugged out<br/>
My shit be bumping out the record store as if it was a drug house<br/>
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood<br/>
Nigga what! It ain't nothing but a party when we thug<br/>
And there I was, a young nigga with heart<br/>
Ain't had shit to lose<br/>
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules<br/>
D-R-E you got me heated<br/>
My words like a penitentiary dick<br/>
Hitting bitches where it's most needed<br/>
Money and weed, Alize and Hennessy<br/>
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me<br/>
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode<br/>
The life of a boss playa, fuck what you thought, though<br/>
My enemies deceased, die like a bitch<br/>
When my album hit the streets, niggas can't see me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[George Clinton (2Pac):]</i><br/>
(Niggas can't see me)<br/>
(They can't see me)<br/>
Which way did he go, George?<br/>
Which way did he go?<br/>
Oh!! which way did he go?<br/>
Which way did he go?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
You niggas made a mistake<br/>
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre<br/>
Them Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day<br/>
Hey homie, if you feel me<br/>
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't killed me<br/>
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle n' roll<br/>
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes<br/>
And I can make you jealous niggas famous<br/>
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is<br/>
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way<br/>
If this rapping bring me money, then I'm rapping 'til I'm paid<br/>
I'm getting green like I'm supposed to<br/>
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through<br/>
Look to the star, and visualize my debut<br/>
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true<br/>
Don't be a dumb motherfucker cause it's crazy after dark<br/>
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart<br/>
Niggas can't see me!<br/>
<br/>
Yo, check this out: stay off his dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[George Clinton (2Pac):]</i><br/>
(Niggas can't see me)<br/>
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here<br/>
You niggas can't see me<br/>
You can't see me<br/>
(I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face)<br/>
(But you still can't see me)<br/>
You can't see me<br/>
(All up in your range, but niggas can't see me)<br/>
20/20 vision won't visualize<br/>
(I'm in the flesh baby, but you can't see me)<br/>
All those glasses won't help you realize<br/>
(You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me)<br/>
You can't see me<br/>
(Thug Life, baby)<br/>
(Don't believe everything you read!)<br/>
(Alize and weed)<br/>
You can't see me, right before your very eyes<br/>
You won't even visualize, you can't see me<br/>
(Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac)<br/>
Niggas can't see me<br/>
(I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!<br/>
(This one's for you, BIG baby)<br/>
(Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me)<br/>
(Niggas can't see me)<br/>
You can't see me<br/>
<br/>
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil<br/>
You won't see me<br/>
Yeah, first see me, now you don't<br/>
Wanna see me, but you won't<br/>
Come to see me, but you can't<br/>
Oh, you can't see me, you can't see me<br/>
Right between your eyes and you'll never realize<br/>
Right before your eyes, you won't even realize<br/>
Visualize what you can't see
