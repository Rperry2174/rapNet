<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Rest in peace to my motherfucker Biggy Smallz<br/>
That's right bwoy, it's goin on, right here<br/>
Thug Life<br/>
God bless the dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
God bless the dead, and buried<br/>
Nigga, don't worry if you see God first<br/>
Tell him shit got worse, I ain't mad<br/>
I know you representin the crew<br/>
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew<br/>
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game<br/>
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came<br/>
My role models - gone or they locked in the pen<br/>
Straight hustlers, caught up in the whirlwind<br/>
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy<br/>
Sayin shit don't stop nigga no pity<br/>
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams<br/>
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes<br/>
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind<br/>
I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time<br/>
My epitaph, will read, was the last of G's<br/>
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed<br/>
God bless the dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
God bless the dead <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang<br/>
I been caught up in this game<br/>
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin to hang<br/>
I can see 'em in my head, pow<br/>
Memories of my nigga but he dead now<br/>
Lookin back in my yearbook, all the years took<br/>
Half my peers, they're stretched for years<br/>
And if I die will they all shed tears?<br/>
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear<br/>
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror<br/>
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time<br/>
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice<br/>
Fuck the police and all the courts, same way they fucked us<br/>
And why the hell am I locked in jail<br/>
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell<br/>
In my mind I can see it comin<br/>
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin<br/>
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin at ya<br/>
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter<br/>
God bless the dead<br/>
<br/>
God bless the dead <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early<br/>
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime<br/>
Real motherfuckin G's, this one is for you<br/>
Yo Stretch, Biggy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stretch:]</i><br/>
Yo Big, this is to you my nigga<br/>
Springfield Hollis Crew, Thug Life, YG'z<br/>
Sendin they respect, yaknowhatImean?<br/>
You my nigga for life, forever<br/>
You're always gonna be with a nigga<br/>
No matter what, don't forget that<br/>
<br/>
I pray before I go to sleep - "Dear God"<br/>
Say my grace before I start to eat, cause times is hard<br/>
So I'm droppin to my knees, oh why?<br/>
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?<br/>
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, Uzi weighin a ton<br/>
Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun<br/>
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me<br/>
But it's mind blowin so I'm flowin goin crazy<br/>
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk<br/>
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk<br/>
But spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big<br/>
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did<br/>
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin you, yes<br/>
The Teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin vest<br/>
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick<br/>
The spirit Biggy Smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stretch:]</i><br/>
God bless the dead <i>[4x]</i>
