To my niggas that went out in line on duty<br/>
21-gun salute! One love, one thug, one nation<br/>
(Let's get down, let's do this!)<br/>
21-gun salute! (Come on, yeah, let's do this!)<br/>
21-gun salute! (Come on, come on, let's do this!)<br/>
All the time I beâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know<br/>
This be the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed<br/>
To the truest shit I ever spoke<br/>
<br/>
21-gun salute, dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots<br/>
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops<br/>
This little nigga named Nas think he live like me<br/>
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me<br/>
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit<br/>
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet<br/>
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed 'em out<br/>
Next time grown folks talk, nigga, close your mouth!<br/>
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply<br/>
Done seen too many real players fall<br/>
To let these bitch niggas beat me<br/>
Puffy, let's be honest, you a punk<br/>
Or you will see me with gloves<br/>
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me being a thug?<br/>
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want<br/>
But you and I know what's goin' on<br/>
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back<br/>
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that<br/>
All you old rappers tryin' to advance<br/>
It's all over now, take it like a man<br/>
Niggas lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick<br/>
Tryin' to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick<br/>
Let it be known, this is how you made me<br/>
Lovin' how I got you niggas crazy<br/>
<br/>
Against all odds, hopin' my thug motherfuckers know<br/>
This be the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed<br/>
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds<br/>
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know<br/>
This be the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
<br/>
I heard he was light skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent<br/>
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin'<br/>
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap<br/>
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack<br/>
Knew he was workin' for the feds<br/>
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said<br/>
And did I mention?<br/>
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time<br/>
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine<br/>
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up<br/>
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up<br/>
Touch one of mine, on everything I love<br/>
I'll destroy everything you touch<br/>
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye<br/>
Last words to a bitch nigga: "Why you lie?"<br/>
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front<br/>
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck<br/>
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B<br/>
So believe me, we enemies, I go against all odds<br/>
<br/>
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know<br/>
This be the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed<br/>
To the truest shit I ever spoke<br/>
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know<br/>
This be the realest shit I ever wrote, against all odds<br/>
<br/>
Puffy gettin' bribed like a bitch, to hide that fact<br/>
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that<br/>
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead<br/>
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead<br/>
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said<br/>
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead<br/>
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written<br/>
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten<br/>
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers<br/>
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers<br/>
Now you wanna live my life<br/>
So what's a "hasa", Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right<br/>
You've seen too many movies<br/>
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes<br/>
Since you lie you die; goodbye!<br/>
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me<br/>
What would you do if you was me? Nigga<br/>
<br/>
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know<br/>
This be the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed<br/>
To the truest shit I ever spoke<br/>
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know<br/>
This be the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed<br/>
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds<br/>
<br/>
21-gun salute, one love to my true thug niggas<br/>
(Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)<br/>
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty<br/>
Representin' to the fullest, being soldiers with military minds<br/>
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute<br/>
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong<br/>
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you<br/>
To all you bitch made niggas, I'm comin' for you<br/>
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is<br/>
You touch me I'm at you<br/>
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot<br/>
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga<br/>
I just remember what you told me<br/>
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right<br/>
I got my money right now, now I want war
