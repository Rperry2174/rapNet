All around the world, same song<br/>
All all around the world same song<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shock G:]</i><br/>
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on<br/>
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song<br/>
That I'm singing, dinga-linging, funky beats ringing<br/>
Everybody's swinging in the place<br/>
As I kick the J-A-Z-Z-Y style<br/>
R&amp;B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat<br/>
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long till I'm gone<br/>
It's just the same old song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Humpty Hump:]</i><br/>
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kicking<br/>
Sweat dripping, girlies in the limo eating chicken<br/>
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose<br/>
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose<br/>
Sneezing, but still I'm pleasing to all the slimmies<br/>
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny<br/>
If it's good and plenty, don't you know<br/>
There I go, there I go, there I go<br/>
But I don't go nowhere without my jim hat<br/>
If I'm rapping, cause she's clapping<br/>
Then I'm strapping cause I'm smarter than that<br/>
Then girlie maybe we can get along<br/>
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song<br/>
<br/>
All around the world, same song<br/>
All all around the world same song<br/>
<i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Money B:]</i><br/>
Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down<br/>
As a matter of fact ill be right back i gotta take a leak<br/>
So I'm draining entertaining, but I got fame<br/>
And the bases I touch too much for me trying to be naming<br/>
Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned<br/>
I busted in and I was Gone With The Wind<br/>
Clark Gable back in Oakland its the same old song<br/>
Sport these shorties, same freckles and hat<br/>
Drinking the same 40s<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Humpty Hump:]</i><br/>
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip<br/>
Just like butter, my rhymes are legit<br/>
Cause I'm the humpty. not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump<br/>
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shock G:]</i><br/>
Ah shut up and just listen<br/>
Not dissing don't get me wrong<br/>
But to me its just the same old song<br/>
So just watch, my name is shock, and i like to rock<br/>
And you can't stop this<br/>
2Pac go ahead and rock this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground<br/>
Girls used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around<br/>
Gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me<br/>
Harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me<br/>
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high<br/>
Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy<br/>
(Claimin' fame, must have changed, now that we became strong)<br/>
I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song<br/>
<br/>
All around the world, same song<br/>
All all around the world same song<br/>
<i>[3x]</i>
