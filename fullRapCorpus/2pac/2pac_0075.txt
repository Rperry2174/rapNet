In the life we live as thugs<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see<br/>
It's hard to be a man<br/>
Ridin' with my guns in hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Why explain the game<br/>
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions<br/>
If victims can't stand the heat then stay the fuck out the kitchen<br/>
Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean<br/>
Itchin', givin' suckers plenty space<br/>
Have these bitch niggas snitchin'<br/>
Where are we now, guns found daily<br/>
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me<br/>
For sellin' dope they backwards<br/>
Make track burst, whenever I rap<br/>
Attack<br/>
Words bein' known to explode on contact<br/>
Extreme at times<br/>
Blinded by my passion and fury<br/>
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry<br/>
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me<br/>
Truely effective<br/>
The shit you heard ain't do me justice<br/>
Got a death wish, bitch<br/>
Run but face, being traced, by the infrared beam<br/>
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team<br/>
Ain't nobody holdin' you back, explode the track to confetti<br/>
Unload it<br/>
Cause niggas ain't ready<br/>
The life of an outlaw<br/>
<br/>
In the life we live as thugs<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see<br/>
It's hard to be a man<br/>
Ridin' with my guns in hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Code 3<br/>
Attack formation<br/>
Pull out your pistols<br/>
Keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin' to get you<br/>
Merciless madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue<br/>
Automatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run<br/>
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'<br/>
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream<br/>
Dope got me hatin' fiends<br/>
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few<br/>
My foes victim of explosives<br/>
Come closer<br/>
Exhale the fumes<br/>
We got memories fadin' fast<br/>
A slave for cash<br/>
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash<br/>
Don't look now. How you like it, raw<br/>
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws<br/>
Never surrender<br/>
Death before dishonor, stay free<br/>
I'm thugged out<br/>
Fuck the world cause this is how they made me<br/>
Scarred but still breathin'<br/>
Believe in me and you could see the victory<br/>
A warrior with jewels<br/>
Will you picture me?<br/>
Life of and outlaw<br/>
<br/>
In the life we live as thugs (no doubt)<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with us (yes!), so can't you see (life of an outlaw)<br/>
It's hard to be a man (soldiers in position, attack formation)<br/>
Ridin' with my guns in hand<br/>
(No retreat, no surrender)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble:]</i><br/>
City under siege<br/>
It's like I can't even breathe<br/>
I'm from the state of car thieves<br/>
G, deep from the street<br/>
Plenty beef<br/>
I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene<br/>
Mobb peep<br/>
This nigga from behind tryin' to creep<br/>
No half-wits, no straps, jack<br/>
It's on to bounce back<br/>
An ounce of wrath so bad,it snatched my style on death<br/>
Tell the reaper I was sent to get ya<br/>
Snip with clippers<br/>
Get the picture<br/>
I wrote my life down as a scripture<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I. Mean:]</i><br/>
And still I'm lost in the land of the lonely<br/>
Where ain't nobody holy<br/>
A matter of a fact, we unholy<br/>
Everybody livin' soley for themselves<br/>
Too high strung to lend help<br/>
To somebody who be needin' it<br/>
You know we lost hope and we needin' it<br/>
Wit' the evil it's forever<br/>
But it might be low down, scandalous<br/>
Like a tramp is<br/>
All for the street fame on how to be managed<br/>
To plan shit<br/>
6 months in advanced to what we plotted<br/>
Approved to go on swole and now I got it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
Uh, crack my window<br/>
Knowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'<br/>
Attach a strap under my pillow hand to hand like we freakin'<br/>
Creepin' deep into mornin'<br/>
Peepin' out the weak while they yawnin'<br/>
And let my clout speak for itself<br/>
No doubt<br/>
Outlaw<br/>
Outta my mind, outta time<br/>
You're all blind<br/>
Some kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind<br/>
Findin' it funny, matter of fact, cause it is<br/>
Perhaps finally I'll adapt to it over the years as an outlaw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[(2Pac) Napoleon:]</i><br/>
(Eh, Napoleon)<br/>
What's up, nigga?<br/>
(Would you die for me, nigga?)<br/>
Hell yeah<br/>
(Would you kill for me, nigga?)<br/>
On my grandmother, nigga<br/>
(Ah yo)<br/>
What's up<br/>
(Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now<br/>
Watch out)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
Well, now they all say that vultures and parasites<br/>
Snakes are all alike<br/>
Thug life break night<br/>
Drink 'til we fist fight<br/>
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest<br/>
But there won't be no breathin' for the reason<br/>
Punk bitch on your breath<br/>
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark<br/>
So chase the air hide your stash<br/>
Beware from <i>[?]</i> marks<br/>
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly<br/>
And let me bust back to them niggas 'til they all cold and sweaty<br/>
<br/>
In the life we live as thugs<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see<br/>
It's hard to be a man<br/>
Ridin' with my guns in hand<br/>
In the life we live as thugs<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see<br/>
It's hard to be a man<br/>
Ridin' with my guns in hand<br/>
In the life we live as thugs<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see<br/>
It's hard to be a man<br/>
Ridin' with my guns in hand<br/>
In the life we live as thugs<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see<br/>
It's hard to be a man<br/>
Ridin' with my guns in hand
