I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah<br/>
You don't wanna fuck with me<br/>
Got the police bustin' at me<br/>
But they can't do nothin' to a G<br/>
Let's get ready to rumble!<br/>
<br/>
Now, you know how we do it, like a G<br/>
What really go on in the mind of a nigga<br/>
that get down for theirs<br/>
Constantly, money over bitches<br/>
Not bitches over money<br/>
Stay on your grind, nigga<br/>
My ambitions as a ridah<br/>
My ambitions as a ridah<br/>
<br/>
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars<br/>
This life as a rap star is nothing without guard<br/>
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public<br/>
My attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it<br/>
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease<br/>
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be<br/>
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah<br/>
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her<br/>
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, hoe!"<br/>
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke<br/>
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feeling crucial<br/>
From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual<br/>
From hustlin' and prayers<br/>
To breaking motherfuckers to pay up<br/>
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us<br/>
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin'<br/>
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'<br/>
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory<br/>
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted<br/>
Now it's on and it's on because I said so<br/>
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row<br/>
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious<br/>
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us<br/>
But thug niggas be on point and game tight<br/>
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night<br/>
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me<br/>
These niggas is jealous<br/>
'Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me<br/>
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya<br/>
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention<br/>
To my ambitions as a ridah<br/>
<br/>
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah<br/>
You don't wanna fuck with me<br/>
Got the police bustin' at me<br/>
But they can't do nothin' to a G<br/>
Let's get ready to rumble<br/>
<br/>
Peep it, it was my only wish to rise<br/>
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise<br/>
When it's time to ride<br/>
I was the first off this side, give me the 9<br/>
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life<br/>
That's what they screaming as they drill me<br/>
But I'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)<br/>
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel<br/>
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me<br/>
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed<br/>
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts<br/>
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught<br/>
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'<br/>
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson<br/>
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it<br/>
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it<br/>
When it's time to die, to be a man<br/>
And pick the way you leave<br/>
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah<br/>
<br/>
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah<br/>
You don't wanna fuck with me<br/>
Got the police bustin' at me<br/>
But they can't do nothin' to a G<br/>
Let's get ready to rumble<br/>
<br/>
My murderous lyrics<br/>
Equipped with spirits of the thugs before me<br/>
Pay off the block, evade the cops<br/>
'Cause I know they coming for me<br/>
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years<br/>
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears<br/>
Question my methods to switch up speeds<br/>
Sure as some bitches bleed<br/>
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed<br/>
Blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)<br/>
didn't diminish my powers<br/>
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards<br/>
That's why they tried to set me up<br/>
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up<br/>
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated<br/>
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it<br/>
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary<br/>
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried<br/>
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it<br/>
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it<br/>
Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside<br/>
the cry from all your people when they find her<br/>
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic<br/>
Revenge on them niggas that played me<br/>
And all the cowards that was down with it<br/>
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'<br/>
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah<br/>
<br/>
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah<br/>
You don't wanna fuck with me<br/>
Got the police bustin' at me<br/>
But they can't do nothin' to a G<br/>
Let's get ready to rumble
