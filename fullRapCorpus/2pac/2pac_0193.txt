Lookin' for these better days<br/>
Better days, hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
Better days, better days, better days<br/>
Hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
<br/>
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live<br/>
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids<br/>
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through<br/>
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do<br/>
Faced with the demons<br/>
Addicted to hearin' victims screamin'<br/>
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens<br/>
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days<br/>
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways<br/>
I'd love to see the block in peace<br/>
With no more dealers and crooked cops<br/>
The only way to stop the beast<br/>
And only we can change<br/>
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same<br/>
Too many murders, too many funerals, and too many tears<br/>
Just seen another brother buried<br/>
Plus I knew him for years<br/>
Passed by his family, but what could I say?<br/>
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith<br/>
And pray for better days<br/>
<br/>
Better days, better days<br/>
Hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
Better days, better days, better days<br/>
Hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
<br/>
Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who would've guessed<br/>
That in my future years I'd be stressin'?<br/>
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted<br/>
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang<br/>
With the brothers I grew up with<br/>
Tryin' to keep my head up and stay strong<br/>
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long<br/>
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke<br/>
Savin' up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope<br/>
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too<br/>
And so am I; I can't take her to the places she wanna go to<br/>
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night<br/>
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight<br/>
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent<br/>
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend<br/>
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed<br/>
So many blessings while we stressin'<br/>
Lookin' for them better days<br/>
<br/>
Better days, better days<br/>
Hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
Better days, better days, better days<br/>
Hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
<br/>
Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools<br/>
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you<br/>
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded<br/>
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it<br/>
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him<br/>
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'<br/>
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks<br/>
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart<br/>
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten<br/>
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends<br/>
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell<br/>
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail<br/>
And me, I'm doin' cool<br/>
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school<br/>
Every once in a while, I reminisce<br/>
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days<br/>
<br/>
Better days, better days<br/>
Hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
Better days, better days, better days<br/>
Hey, better days<br/>
Got me thinkin' about better days<br/>
<br/>
I send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh<br/>
Clinton lockdown, Rikers Island<br/>
All them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe<br/>
E Block, F Block, lower H<br/>
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate<br/>
All the peoples I met along the way<br/>
Better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!
