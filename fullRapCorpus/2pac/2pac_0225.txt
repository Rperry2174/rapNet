Maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
<i>[5x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Ever since I was a young scrub<br/>
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin drugs<br/>
And running from the narcs when they pass by, don't ask why<br/>
I'm a hustler, till my ass die<br/>
Even if I do come up, I'll be ready when they run up, huh<br/>
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh<br/>
I never trust these hoes at all<br/>
Fuckin' with them tramp-ass sluts you supposed to fall<br/>
Said she played you for your money but the shit was cool<br/>
Guess it's true, niggas be bitches too<br/>
You can't see how she worked you, all up in the skirt<br/>
Now you looking like a jerk cause she hurt you<br/>
Now head's up, don't be a playa hater, just peep game<br/>
Keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change<br/>
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot<br/>
Hand it over motherfucker 'fore I shoot - who do you love?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
Tell me who do you love?<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
Tell me who do you love?<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I'm living that, thug life baby!<br/>
Steady smoking indo, going crazy<br/>
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down<br/>
We in the dark, do you love me?<br/>
Everybody's talking 'bout they, KNOW ME<br/>
But they ain't down like my motherfuckin' homies<br/>
Tell me what you need when you, SEE ME<br/>
And we can get it on, BEOTCH, take it easy<br/>
Don't try to hold me, control me<br/>
But you can take my number baby call me when you lonely<br/>
Cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why<br/>
I'm high 'til I die, and strapped with my fo'-five<br/>
Cause you can lose it in the gutter<br/>
I wonder if I'll die by the hands of another broke motherfucker<br/>
They call me the alcoholer, I'm all in<br/>
Thug for life nigga balling<br/>
I'm getting tired of these hoes trying to play me<br/>
You can't fade me and my niggas going crazy<br/>
All day long I'm straight thuggin, and constantly mean muggin<br/>
Breakin' the bitches that be bugging tell me who do you love?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
Tell me who do you love?<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
Tell me who do you love?<br/>
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me<br/>
Who do you love?
