Yo 'Pac yo, I heard you got beat up by the police<br/>
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything<br/>
Niggas just wanna know<br/>
If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass sheeeit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true<br/>
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through<br/>
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed<br/>
A loaded AK-47 lay under my head so I don't trip<br/>
One motherfucker from the Underground<br/>
And Big Stretch bucking niggas if they fuck around<br/>
Yo why I got beef with police?<br/>
Ain't that a bitch that motherfuckers got a beef with me<br/>
They make it hard for me to sleep<br/>
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep<br/>
I guess it's hard for you to see<br/>
But now I'm pointing the finger at police<br/>
Instead of them motherfuckers blaming me<br/>
I got the right to bear a pistol<br/>
And when the punk motherfuckers get to tripping I got shit too<br/>
And maybe then you'll see the truth (hell yeah)<br/>
But until then, I gotta do what I do<br/>
And stay a crooked nigga too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raphael Saadiq:]</i><br/>
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do<br/>
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say<br/>
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?<br/>
I'm gon' do, what I do<br/>
I'm gon' say, what I say<br/>
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Y'know you really can't say that ya blame niggas<br/>
Fuck being tame, set aflame, time to aim triggers<br/>
2Pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the Constitution<br/>
I want my bucks for restitution<br/>
This time you got a bigger problem<br/>
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem<br/>
And we ain't shooting at each other<br/>
That's my motherfuckin' brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover<br/>
And all the bitches from the Klan<br/>
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and<br/>
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)<br/>
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin' tec-9<br/>
They know they scared to see us sober<br/>
Stop drinking King Cobra, and niggas'll take the world over<br/>
It's all up to you (up to you)<br/>
Blame the Korean, blame the Jew, or be a crooked nigga too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raphael Saadiq:]</i><br/>
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do<br/>
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say<br/>
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?<br/>
I'm gon' do, what I do<br/>
I'm gon' say, what I say<br/>
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Aiyyo! Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me<br/>
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G<br/>
They got my homies in a jail cell<br/>
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is going to Hell<br/>
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers<br/>
And nuttin but love for each other<br/>
So motherfucker make a motion<br/>
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean<br/>
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga<br/>
But they hate it when we pop the cops<br/>
That's when they getting petrol<br/>
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row<br/>
But I learn to look ahead of me<br/>
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy<br/>
We blowing up precincts and OOOH<br/>
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raphael Saadiq:]</i><br/>
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do<br/>
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say<br/>
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?<br/>
I'm gon' do, what I do<br/>
I'm gon' say, what I say<br/>
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raphael Saadiq:]</i><br/>
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia<br/>
(I'm a crooked nigga too)<br/>
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia<br/>
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia<br/>
(I'm a crooked, crooked nigga too)<br/>
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia<br/>
Y'all gon' stop fuckin' with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raphael Saadiq:]</i><br/>
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do<br/>
