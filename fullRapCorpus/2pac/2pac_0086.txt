<br/>
<i>[*laughing*]</i><br/>
<br/>
Thug style out this, motherfucker, niggas, throw ya hands in the air<br/>
If you got Jeep make ya speakers pop<br/>
I want motherfuckin' police tryin' to pull niggas over on this one<br/>
We takin' this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style thug style<br/>
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G<br/>
We ain't dead yet<br/>
<br/>
Hit me, I got my Hennessy find ya foes<br/>
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes<br/>
I'm gettin' high off Buddha cause the times be slow<br/>
I keep my mind on dough you never find me broke<br/>
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G<br/>
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me<br/>
I can't sleep livin' in these wicked times, peep<br/>
Niggas after me cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat<br/>
You can holler if you want to, please!<br/>
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew be, bleed!<br/>
Enemies and my range is on, you're in the danger zone<br/>
My fuckin' game is strong, now hotline<br/>
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine<br/>
From hustlin' and bustin' them rhymes<br/>
To my niggas up in Quentin, Down on Rikers Isle<br/>
Stay rile, but a nigga gotta use his styles<br/>
<br/>
These, niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style<br/>
These, niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops<br/>
It's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from Glocks<br/>
And all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends<br/>
I'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)<br/>
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie<br/>
Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide<br/>
My mama cried when they took me off to jail<br/>
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell<br/>
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside<br/>
Will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive<br/>
I cry, but in my own way swallow my pride<br/>
Pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die<br/>
Cemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down<br/>
Even now I wonder will I still be around<br/>
My hometown is the gutter I was born a wild<br/>
I came up out this dust with my heartless style<br/>
<br/>
These, niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style<br/>
These, niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style<br/>
<br/>
I remember Uptown, run catch a kiss<br/>
Listenin' to Mr. Magic<br/>
Cuttin' up the hits And even though I had a habit<br/>
Makin' words rhyme I was caught up in the madness<br/>
Juvenile thugs come on<br/>
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth<br/>
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs<br/>
And Pete and Lee young G's with a gift of gab<br/>
Tryna hook up with the hookers who was quick to stab Remember mama's cookin', no school straight hookin'<br/>
And tryin' to get with light skinned cause she good lookin'<br/>
And jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't payin'<br/>
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playin'<br/>
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck<br/>
I had to move around a lot cause my moms was stuck<br/>
I had family but I was way too wild<br/>
Had to move to the West to regain my style<br/>
<br/>
These, niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)<br/>
Niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (my nigga scream)<br/>
Niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)<br/>
Niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)<br/>
Niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style<br/>
These, niggas don't know my style<br/>
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child<br/>
Try to put me in the mothafuckin' cross, but my force was wild<br/>
Mothafuckin' bitches<br/>
<br/>
Swear y'all know nigga<br/>
Ever heard motherfucka say all in Kool-Aid know the flavor hahha<br/>
