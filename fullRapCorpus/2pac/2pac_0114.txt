<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo:]</i><br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real<br/>
How do you want it yeah?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out<br/>
Got a brother wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out<br/>
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it<br/>
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it<br/>
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'<br/>
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meanin'<br/>
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance<br/>
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can<br/>
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man<br/>
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man<br/>
Mr. International, player with the passport<br/>
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for<br/>
It's either him or me - Champagne, Hennessy<br/>
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies<br/>
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need<br/>
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need<br/>
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day<br/>
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way<br/>
Your body is bangin' baby I love it when you flaunt it<br/>
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo:]</i><br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How does it feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Tell me is it cool to fuck?<br/>
Did you think I come to talk?<br/>
Am I a fool or what?<br/>
Positions on the floor<br/>
It's like erotic<br/>
Ironic, cause I'm somewhat psychotic<br/>
I'm hittin'' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics<br/>
Up and down like a roller coaster<br/>
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over<br/>
Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me<br/>
Get her rockin' these<br/>
Nights full of Alize<br/>
A livin' legend you ain't heard about<br/>
These niggas play these Cali days<br/>
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker<br/>
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother<br/>
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole<br/>
You're too old to understand the way the game's told<br/>
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts<br/>
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that<br/>
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell<br/>
Livin' in hell - only a few of us'll live to tell<br/>
Now everybody talkin' about us I could give a fuck<br/>
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss<br/>
Nigga, tell me how you want it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo:]</i><br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Raised as a youth<br/>
Tell the truth, I got the scoop<br/>
On how to get a bulletproof<br/>
Cause I jumped from the roof<br/>
'fore I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager<br/>
Game rules, I'm livin' major - my adversaries<br/>
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried<br/>
One of us gonna see the cemetery<br/>
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive<br/>
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die<br/>
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million<br/>
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all<br/>
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me<br/>
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me<br/>
But I'ma mash out and peel out<br/>
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out<br/>
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it<br/>
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it<br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo:]</i><br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
<br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Me and my Nigga Johnny J... yeah we out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo:]</i><br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>
How do you want it?<br/>
How do you feel?<br/>
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game<br/>
Livin' in the fast lane<br/>
I'm for real<br/>

<i>[K-Ci &amp; JoJo:]</i><br/>
