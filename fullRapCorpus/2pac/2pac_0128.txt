<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
The money behind the dreams<br/>
My right hand, my other Capo in this big motherfuckin' war we got<br/>
My other Capo in this big-ass<br/>
Conglomerate called Death Row<br/>
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather<br/>
And who's he coming through right now?<br/>
Makaveli the Don<br/>
Feel this, Killuminati<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Lord have mercy, father help us all<br/>
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call<br/>
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back<br/>
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that<br/>
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes<br/>
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise<br/>
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room<br/>
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me<br/>
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck<br/>
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?<br/>
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top<br/>
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot<br/>
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?<br/>
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside<br/>
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust<br/>
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking<br/>
When we're tossing it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Danny Boy:]</i><br/>
Feel this baby, I like the way it's going down<br/>
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride<br/>
Giving me that nice smile<br/>
Female I like, what I want to give all night<br/>
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up<br/>
Baby let's get it on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jojo:]</i><br/>
I like the way you please me, baby<br/>
The sexy way you tease me, shorty<br/>
The way you move your body<br/>
It really drives me crazy<br/>
Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting<br/>
So baby come on home with me<br/>
I like the way you give it to me, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Danny Boy &amp; JoJo:]</i><br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Play on, play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on, play on, play on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci:]</i><br/>
Oh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm, that want you lady<br/>
Oh, don't act so shady<br/>
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy<br/>
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang<br/>
Girl you make my bells rang, make them go ting-a-ling!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Aaron Hall:]</i><br/>
Nasty man, I'm here again<br/>
Don't want it to ever end<br/>
It's feeling too good<br/>
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady<br/>
Your body the kind I like-ah<br/>
Big booty titillating delight-ah<br/>
Back it up yo, let me in there<br/>
Toss it up for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-Ci &amp; Aaron Hall:]</i><br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
I like the way you give it to me<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
So won't you play on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around<br/>
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now<br/>
Still down for that Death Row sound, searching for paydays<br/>
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci<br/>
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting Child's Play<br/>
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize<br/>
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move<br/>
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?<br/>
Laugh at you suckers cause you similar<br/>
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature<br/>
Screaming "Compton", but you can't return, you ain't heard?<br/>
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs<br/>
Mob on to this new era, cause we Untouchable<br/>
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushing you<br/>
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed<br/>
Who can you trust? Only time reveals<br/>
Toss it up<br/>
<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
Let me see you toss it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Yeah no doubt<br/>
Toss it up now<br/>
Play on playa, play on<br/>
How can some non-players do a song about tossing it up<br/>
And then want to do a player song?<br/>
(you so fat, you and Lil' Kim need a weight scale to lay down in bed<br/>
We are not little kids, you fat ass, you feelin' threatened)<br/>
How can non-players do it? (you know who I'm talking bout)<br/>
Teddy Riley, who? Puffy? Who?<br/>
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon<br/>
You still ain't touching us, all that peace talk<br/>
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy<br/>
It's on! Toss it up, we took you on<br/>
And we took y'all beat (toss it up)<br/>
You know who beat we took, and we took y'all beat<br/>
Cause you wasn't rocking it right! (toss it up now)<br/>
Tired of suckers rocking beats that don't belong to them, toss it up, it's on, it's out there now, it's our beat now<br/>
Yeah, toss it up now!
