<i>[Malcolm X prison scene:]</i><br/>
Yo, Jackson! A 231549<br/>
Yeah, close four! Comin' down!<br/>
Crichlow! A 5991301<br/>
Close five! Comin' down!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
My homeboys in Clinton And Rikers Island<br/>
All the Penitentiaries<br/>
Mumia, Mutulu, Geronimo, Sekon<br/>
All the political Prisoners<br/>
San Quentin (Look at Satan) (I see him)<br/>
All the jailhouses, I'm with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac (Tyrone Wrice):]</i><br/>
Yeah, one thug, one thug<br/>
(How do we keep the music playin'?)<br/>
You're listenin' to the sounds of one thug<br/>
One thug, one thug, how do we get ahead?<br/>
You're listenin' to the sounds of…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
I wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military<br/>
Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried<br/>
Was it me, the weed, or this life I lead?<br/>
If daytime is for suckers, then tonight we breathe<br/>
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks<br/>
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps<br/>
Meet me at the cemetery, dressed in black<br/>
Tonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back<br/>
So, if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears<br/>
An outlaw thug livin' in this game for years<br/>
Why worry? Hope to God, get me high when I'm buried<br/>
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me<br/>
Don't rush me to the gates of Heaven<br/>
Let me picture for a while, how I lived for my days as a child<br/>
I wonder now, how do we outlast?<br/>
Always get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]</i><br/>
How do we keep the music playin'?<br/>
(Yes, you got to hold ya head!)<br/>
How do we get ahead? (Hold ya head!)<br/>
Too many young black brothers are dyin'<br/>
(Yes, you got to hold ya head!)<br/>
Livin' fast, too fast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
These felonies be like prophecies<br/>
Beggin' me to stop, 'cause these<br/>
Lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us<br/>
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice<br/>
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost<br/>
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze<br/>
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows<br/>
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'<br/>
Got a cell at the pen' for me waitin'—is this my fate?<br/>
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?<br/>
Never that, too much tequila drinkin', we all that<br/>
Make them understand me? Hell nah, this ain't my posse<br/>
Everyone with me is family, 'cause everybody's got me<br/>
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'<br/>
Got us all meetin' up in prison<br/>
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood<br/>
Sayin', "Please show a playa love"—hold ya head! (Hold it!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]</i><br/>
How do we keep the music playin'?<br/>
(You got to hold ya head!)<br/>
How do we get ahead? (Come on, hold ya head!)<br/>
Too many young black brothers are dyin'<br/>
(Yes, hold ya head!)<br/>
Livin' fast, too fast<br/>
(The weed got me tweakin' in my mind, I'm thinkin'…)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
God bless the child that can hold his own<br/>
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome<br/>
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds<br/>
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed<br/>
Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free<br/>
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me<br/>
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally<br/>
Runnin' from authorities 'til they capture me<br/>
And my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears<br/>
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years<br/>
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head<br/>
Tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead<br/>
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll<br/>
Catch a brother at the crossroads<br/>
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass<br/>
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls; hold ya head!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]</i><br/>
How do we keep the music playin'?<br/>
(You got to hold ya head!)<br/>
How do we get ahead? (C'mon, hold ya head!)<br/>
Too many young black brothers are dyin'<br/>
(Yes, hold ya head!)<br/>
Livin' fast, too fast<br/>
(You got to hold ya head!)<br/>
(How do we keep the music playin'?)<br/>
(Yes, you got to hold ya head!)<br/>
How do we get ahead?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
No matter how hard it get, feel me?<br/>
Get the weed, drink a drink, read a book<br/>
Watch the stars, get some pussy—whatever!
