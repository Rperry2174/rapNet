<i>[2Pac (Ice Cube):]</i><br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Young black male)<br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Ain't shit to fool with)<br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Young black male)<br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Ain't shit to fool with)<br/>
Yes, niggas! Yes, niggas! Yes, niggas!<br/>
Go, nigga, go!<br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Young black male)<br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Ain't shit to fool with)<br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Young black male)<br/>
Hard like an erection<br/>
(Ain't shit to fool with)<br/>

<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Young black male<br/>
I try to effect by kicking the facts<br/>
And stacking much mail<br/>
I'm packing a gat 'cause guys wanna jack<br/>
And fuck going to jail<br/>
'Cause I ain't a crook, despite how I look<br/>
I don't sell yayo<br/>
They judging a brother like covers on books<br/>
Follow me into a flow<br/>
I'm sure you know, which way to go<br/>
I'm hitting 'em out of the doors<br/>
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow<br/>
I'm fucking the sluts and hoes<br/>
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes<br/>
The gimminy jimminy grows<br/>
Then whaddaya know, it's off with some clothes<br/>
Rowd when the crowd says ho<br/>
That let's me know, they know I can flow<br/>
Love when they come to my shows<br/>
I get up and go with skins before<br/>
When I'm collecting my dough<br/>
I never respect, the one that I back<br/>
The quicker the nigga can rap<br/>
The bigger the check<br/>
Now watch how they sweat<br/>
What kind of style is that?<br/>
The style of a mack, and ready to jack<br/>
I rendered up piles of black<br/>
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack<br/>
I hate it when real niggas bust<br/>
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust<br/>
I had enough of the fuss<br/>
I bust what I bust and cuss when I must<br/>
They gave me a charge for sales<br/>
For selling the tales... of young black males<br/>
<br/>
Yes, nigga, N-I-G-G-A, niggas<br/>
Ay, nigga, you can't handle that shit!<br/>
Pass that man!<br/>
Hit that shit, that's the shit!<br/>
It smells like skunk, skunk smells like that nigga, momma<br/>
We ain't nuttin' but some low down dirty niggas<br/>
Keep it real, nigga! Fuck you, nigga!<br/>
You ain't giving me near a dime on this real motherfucker<br/>
Fuck St. Ides, it's an Old E thing, baby<br/>
Strictly some of that Hennessy<br/>
Can I drink with you, fellas? Can I get it on it?<br/>
Fuck you, capo. You ain't in, baby<br/>
I tell you what! You guys are not gonna be talking<br/>
All that shit, when I come back, OK?<br/>
We gonna say who the big mouth, when I come back<br/>
Young black male!
