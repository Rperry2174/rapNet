<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Yo c'mon man, what do you mean you don't wanna ride with me, nigga<br/>
C'mon, get in the car, get in the fuckin' car, man<br/>
Yo why you trippin' man? Get in the fuckin' car, man<br/>
Get in the fuckin' car, get in the car<br/>
(Heh, say you, you scared to ride in my car<br/>
'Cause you, you think niggas gon' be blastin' at it<br/>
It ain't even that deep baby)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now<br/>
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now<br/>
Only got one clique, they Outlawz on the Row<br/>
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes<br/>
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown<br/>
My unknown tendencies to mash my comp<br/>
Gettin' wicked with my ski-mask, find the stash and dump<br/>
While niggas run I'm the last one standin', the rest die<br/>
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, Westside<br/>
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views<br/>
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew<br/>
Five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit<br/>
Niggas die by my orders when I wrote this shit<br/>
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters<br/>
Niggas tried to kill me, and I fed their wife and their daughters<br/>
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash<br/>
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin' past<br/>
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life<br/>
Retaliation proves niggas never caught me right<br/>
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck<br/>
Quit bullshit nigga 'cause I'm still fuckin' yo' bitch<br/>
Niggas got me twisted in a bad way, why you change?<br/>
Fuck with me, all this shit pay, nigga fuck the fame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble:]</i><br/>
Y'all remember "Hit 'Em Up," don't make us do it once more<br/>
Yo' niggas know, you ain't fuckin' with them Out-lawz<br/>
We keep souljas, souljas from Compton to Brooklyn<br/>
Your the type to get sniped, when the cops is lookin'<br/>
Don't nobody give a fuck 'cause you done crossed the game<br/>
Lost in fame, and you should take, all the blame<br/>
You made yo' bed nigga lay in it<br/>
You scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it<br/>
It's not a game only got one click we Outlawz from the do'<br/>
Dirt stains when I buck on the fo', you kissin' the flo'<br/>
We dirty as the motherfuckin' streetz of Jerz<br/>
We sweep niggas with the words though the heat's preferred<br/>
Holla<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now<br/>
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now<br/>
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row<br/>
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes, let the punks know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I.:]</i><br/>
'Pac I wish I was in the motherfuckin' car wit'cha<br/>
I'd have took every bullet that they threw, hand of God, nigga<br/>
I only got one click, Outlawz 'til I'm gone<br/>
Heavy in the game and we comin' for they fuckin' throne<br/>
The love is gone well it is what it is<br/>
And plottin' on us, they best be prayin' for they kids, mayne<br/>
You don't have to worry 'cause I ride for ya<br/>
Like K said over loyal we even tell 'bout a lie for ya<br/>
You put me in the game and dog I owe it all to ya<br/>
And when it get to poppin' I'ma fuckin' ball for ya<br/>
And everything I do gon' have your names on it<br/>
I'll never let them forget I put my seeds on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
You gon' die before yo' time, come face the truth<br/>
In the middle of the desert nigga lace your boots<br/>
As a youth, hundred proof, tap my chest is a dead rest<br/>
You studio niggas still remind your vest<br/>
Why the fuck you ain't done yet, swallow yo' teeth<br/>
In the field you woulda been need a straw when you eat<br/>
Fuck a glock nine that shit is weak on the streets<br/>
And if you can't strategize then you just can't eat<br/>
If your life in another nigga hand, you dead<br/>
And if it's beef and your man disappear then don't sweat it<br/>
Another fake nigga usin' my strengths to get credit<br/>
I mean you might face sound scared but your heartbeat said it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now<br/>
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now<br/>
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row<br/>
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
I was born ugly, unlucky and dusty<br/>
But now I'm a rider, connivin' gutsy<br/>
And I don't trust nobody, so don't nobody trust me<br/>
And that's how I'ma go about it 'til somebody bust me<br/>
I play for keeps like the OG's raised me<br/>
If I sleep I won't eat, who gonna feed my baby?<br/>
And I think I'm goin' crazy 'cause my hair is gettin' thinner<br/>
I've been drinkin' on the daily, I can hardly remember<br/>
I got - bad nerves, paranoia destroyed me<br/>
I love the Lord but the church can't cure me<br/>
I sleep light, I wake peekin' out my window<br/>
With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow<br/>
And that's the way it's gonna be 'til they bury me<br/>
But don't twist it 'cause none of y'all niggas worry me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Noble &amp; Kastro:]</i><br/>
What the fuck you didn't know?<br/>
Kizza-Kastro, Young Noble with the criminal flow<br/>
You nervous nelly ass niggas belly up in the river, no dizoubt<br/>
My niggas couldn't fade me with some clippers<br/>
You put it down, look all around, 'til we find you we hound<br/>
Penitentiary bound, to remind you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kadafi:]</i><br/>
Kadafi I bring the lingo to the click<br/>
Tasty like a Pringle, sneakin' through your chimney like Kris Kringle<br/>
On some shit, get me fee to let my ice click Ka-pling, ka-plow I been a thug shootin' slugs since a child<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now<br/>
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now<br/>
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row<br/>
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know
