"My nigga, what it look like?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying<br/>
Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying<br/>
Genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism<br/>
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killing, no cure<br/>
Oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken<br/>
Police brutality kicking ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan<br/>
Not to mention another prison, child molesting<br/>
Cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing<br/>
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested<br/>
that turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method<br/>
to hold us back, great depression, amongst Iraq no direction<br/>
No google map, just a TEC for the soowoo<br/>
Swerving Isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo<br/>
Mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving<br/>
These commercials keep us buying these cigarettes<br/>
Supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science<br/>
No place to live in, no Zion, see that's forbidden, we frying<br/>
<br/>
"My nigga, what it look like?"<br/>
That's exactly what Hell look like, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Alori Joh]</i><br/>
Tell it like it is, nigga<br/>
Tell it like it is, homeboy<br/>
Tell it like it is, nigga<br/>
Tell it like it is, tell 'em what's up<br/>
<br/>
"My nigga, what it look like?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spitting<br/>
'Pac is rapping, Gregory capping, people singing, bells is ringing<br/>
Children playing, angels praying, fourteen carat golden streets<br/>
Cali greens, red wine, potato yams, turkey legs<br/>
Calling every human being... <i>[fades out]</i>
