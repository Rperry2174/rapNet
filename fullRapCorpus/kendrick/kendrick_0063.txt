<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Greetings boys and girls<br/>
(Greetings boys and girls)<br/>
My name is Petey P. <br/>
(My name is Petey P.)<br/>
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (that's right, that's right, that's right)<br/>
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)<br/>
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)<br/>
So grab your cartoons and cereal (and sing)<br/>
Your pop guns (and sing) and fireworks and sing along<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million<br/>
Spend it all in front of the county building<br/>
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah<br/>
(Sing along kids, sing along)<br/>
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million<br/>
Spend it all in front of the county building<br/>
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah<br/>
<br/>
(Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...)<br/>
<br/>
I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac<br/>
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95<br/>
People staring at 'em in amazement<br/>
Reservations at the Days Inn<br/>
we was living out a hotel at the time<br/>
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried<br/>
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers to move<br/>
With nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' job<br/>
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansion<br/>
Gold ballroom AK-47 dancing<br/>
Howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies<br/>
Hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies<br/>
Everyday we pray to eat at the table of Sizzlers<br/>
But never made that visit, if better days was on its way<br/>
Then it made the decision, to make the wrong turn<br/>
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn<br/>
(Oh yeah I remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Am I right?)<br/>
Spend it all in front of the county building (oh)<br/>
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah<br/>
(Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along)<br/>
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million<br/>
Spend it all in front of the county building<br/>
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah<br/>
<br/>
And all the ghetto children in the world say that's my car<br/>
All the ghetto boys say that's my car<br/>
All the ghetto girls say that's my car<br/>
When we grow up, when we grow up<br/>
Ghetto children in the world say that's my car<br/>
All the ghetto boys say that's my car<br/>
All the ghetto girls say that's my car<br/>
When we grow up, when we grow up<br/>
<br/>
(Nig-nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?)<br/>
<br/>
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (uh huh)<br/>
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty-<br/>
seven do the math ' 92 don't you be lazy (I won't)<br/>
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials<br/>
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle<br/>
Like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental<br/>
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss<br/>
you get that couch I sent you?<br/>
I heard that from a block away probably had credentials<br/>
of a scholar but shit not today<br/>
them Dayton spokes was his to take<br/>
Refrigerators, barbecue pits and Jordan kicks<br/>
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it<br/>
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi I want them ten woo-woofers<br/>
Say that you got me if not I'll dig in your drawer for it<br/>
The swap meet was the bull's eye like Tauruses<br/>
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is<br/>
Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?<br/>
He said lil nigga today the poor is rich<br/>
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb<br/>
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget<br/>
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither<br/>
Niggas gon' snitch watch the company you keeping<br/>
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it<br/>
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots<br/>
(That's right the mothafuckin' Rodney King<br/>
you just put your daddy on Bullis Rd.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (that's crazy)<br/>
Spend it all in front of the county building<br/>
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah<br/>
(Don't forget still sing along kids, still sing along)<br/>
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Please sing)<br/>
Spend it all in front of the county building<br/>
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
