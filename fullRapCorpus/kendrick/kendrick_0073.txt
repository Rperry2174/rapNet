What's wrong nigga?<br/>
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?<br/>
I thought this what you wanted?<br/>
They say if you scared go to church<br/>
But remember<br/>
He knows the bible too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
My baby when I get you get you get you get you<br/>
Ima go head to ride with you<br/>
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you<br/>
Cause I (want you)<br/>
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty<br/>
Registration is out of service<br/>
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving<br/>
Cause I (want you)<br/>
I want you more than you know<br/>
<br/>
I remember you took me to the mall last week baby<br/>
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times<br/>
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified<br/>
That I (want you)<br/>
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy<br/>
I said you crazy<br/>
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
You said to me<br/>
You said your name was Lucy<br/>
I said where's Ricardo?<br/>
I said oh no, not the show<br/>
Than you spit a little rap to me like this<br/>
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit<br/>
You said this to me<br/>
I remember what you said too you said<br/>
My name is Lucy Kendrick<br/>
You introduced me Kendrick<br/>
Usually I don’t do this<br/>
But I see you and me Kendrick<br/>
Lucy Give you no worries<br/>
Lucy got million stories<br/>
About these rappers I came after when they was boring<br/>
Lucy gone fill your pockets<br/>
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton<br/>
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised<br/>
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty<br/>
Avoiding me?<br/>
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly<br/>
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute<br/>
Lucy work harder<br/>
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father<br/>
I'm Lucy<br/>
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly<br/>
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me<br/>
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front<br/>
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work<br/>
I want you to know that Lucy got you<br/>
All your life I watched you<br/>
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that’s possible<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I remembered you was conflicted<br/>
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same<br/>
Abusing my power full of resentment<br/>
Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br/>
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room<br/>
I didn't wanna self destruct<br/>
The evils of Lucy was all around me<br/>
So I went runnin' for answers<br/>
Until I came home
