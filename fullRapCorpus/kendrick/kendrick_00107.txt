<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again<br/>
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me<br/>
Things I don't understand<br/>
Sometimes I need to be alone<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
I can feel your energy from two planets away<br/>
I got my drink, I got my music<br/>
I would share it but today I'm yelling<br/>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich, hol' up<br/>
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks<br/>
But now my album platinum and shit, so what<br/>
Y'all keep the numbers<br/>
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga<br/>
This courtesy of Compton<br/>
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker<br/>
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D<br/>
Dominicans wish that I was born there<br/>
I'm lookin' to be the god MC<br/>
You look at my hat and see thorns there<br/>
I look at the game and see porn there<br/>
I'm fuckin' this industry hard<br/>
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey<br/>
You thought I was fresh out the yard<br/>
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight<br/>
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"<br/>
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak<br/>
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days<br/>
And when the water inside, you're Bobby Boucher<br/>
We thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga<br/>
I got a P89 in a suitcase<br/>
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga<br/>
Lyrical exercise<br/>
Right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe<br/>
Pipe down, it occurred when you heard that I got these words<br/>
To the upper echelon, that's excellent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse<br/>
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud<br/>
Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think<br/>
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink<br/>
In the White House with a mink<br/>
Running through that bitch like it's my house<br/>
All up in the hall like a mall<br/>
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball<br/>
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to empty my memory bank<br/>
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank<br/>
Sittin' next to Hilary smellin' like dank<br/>
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him, I'll wait<br/>
I've been in my weight like 20 years straight<br/>
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight<br/>
Don't fuck up my high, don't fuck up my high<br/>
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie<br/>
Still keep straight and still be straight<br/>
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate<br/>
Don't waste my breath<br/>
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left<br/>
Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point<br/>
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno<br/>
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off<br/>
I'm in this lil' diss shit, I'm pushin' my fart<br/>
Leader of the new school, on my toes like a ballerina<br/>
Who knew I'd be Black Swan<br/>
World in my palms, ironically<br/>
I am the Globetrotters' best<br/>
Cause I didn't drop the ball<br/>
Told niggas when I was 16 that I'd write a 16<br/>
To put a nigga right on the big screen<br/>
In the paddy wagon with 16, should have been in the pen<br/>
But then my pen write with morphine<br/>
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends<br/>
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket<br/>
Cardio lap, was running for dear life but now I'm running the map<br/>
Bitch, I'm here nigga,<br/>
Picture little old me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say<br/>
Nigga you'll never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre<br/>
You ain't get killed in Vegas or hit a Suburban<br/>
Nigga, Puffy Daddy wasn't your favorite<br/>
So many washed up with detergent<br/>
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose<br/>
Like bluck, Mini-14 like bluck<br/>
Empty out another magazine like bluck<br/>
Hit a young nigga, get back<br/>
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe<br/>
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got<br/>
The last that would try to pass a good job<br/>
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo<br/>
Bitch see you at Woodstock
