We on Ali? You ugly<br/>
Everybody just clap your hands if you're real<br/>
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel<br/>
Be yourself, just show me you're real<br/>
Middle fingers up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just let me be me, hmm<br/>
That's the only way I know<br/>
Just let me be me, hmm<br/>
That's the only way I know<br/>
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down<br/>
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I just wanna be me<br/>
No disrespect, but motherfuck you<br/>
My education stopped at a high school degree<br/>
but I can outsmart any high IQ<br/>
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum<br/>
Cold, my style making my nose run<br/>
Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize<br/>
that real lies, within me<br/>
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink<br/>
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit<br/>
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks<br/>
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit<br/>
And California on that jerk shit<br/>
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps<br/>
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'<br/>
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis<br/>
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick<br/>
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit<br/>
Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?<br/>
Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa<br/>
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids<br/>
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?<br/>
I grew up with killers man, people who killed man<br/>
But my character never could be like them man<br/>
And they respect that, say that I'm real man<br/>
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man<br/>
Live my life through some film man?<br/>
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows<br/>
cause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho', and oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Almost lost my life to the industry<br/>
Had to look through a photo book to remember me<br/>
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit<br/>
Have you with professional killers, chasing hits<br/>
Lying to yourself all over an image<br/>
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance<br/>
My mama said, boy that don't sound like you<br/>
I said, this is the sound though, my only excuse<br/>
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie<br/>
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me<br/>
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me<br/>
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth<br/>
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter<br/>
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner<br/>
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender<br/>
to make sure that you feel it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[uncredited female]</i><br/>
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?<br/>
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?<br/>
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?<br/>
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?<br/>
Is this really you? Is this who you are?<br/>
What are you trying to say?<br/>
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?<br/>
Who are you?<br/>
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?<br/>
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?<br/>
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?<br/>
<br/>
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle<br/>
of finding myself as an individual<br/>
The world is so typical<br/>
I just wanna be higher than that<br/>
I used to want to be the messiah of rap<br/>
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star<br/>
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars<br/>
that I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad<br/>
Vanity, they say that it can damage me<br/>
So do I really want it?<br/>
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect<br/>
That means I'll be fronting, hmm<br/>
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story<br/>
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me<br/>
Knowing that I'm misunderstood<br/>
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would<br/>
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there<br/>
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair<br/>
And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty<br/>
and all I could say is, will the radio care?<br/>
Yeah, or should I say no?<br/>
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?<br/>
You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old<br/>
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult<br/>
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined<br/>
but with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried<br/>
My talent should take me places I've never been<br/>
The world should turn soon as my record spin<br/>
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit<br/>
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence<br/>
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens<br/>
Too focussed, one word, righteous<br/>
And this is Kendrick Lamar<br/>
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all<br/>
And that means I wanna be the highest<br/>
Too focussed, one word (righteous)<br/>
Mm, yeah<br/>
That means I wanna be the highest<br/>
Too focussed, one word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[uncredited female]</i><br/>
Too focussed, too focussed, one word<br/>
Too focussed, too focussed, one word<br/>
Too focussed, too focussed, one word<br/>
Too focussed, one word<br/>
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
