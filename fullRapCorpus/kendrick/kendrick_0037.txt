<i>[Ashtro Bot]</i><br/>
We're far from good, not good from far<br/>
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard<br/>
with the top down screaming we don't give a fuck<br/>
Drink my forty ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt<br/>
cause the kids just ain't alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Oh shit nigga, something bout to happen<br/>
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty ki's under the Compton court building<br/>
Hope the dogs don't smell it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Welcome to vigilante, eighties so don't you ask me<br/>
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fucking pantry<br/>
Peeling off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra<br/>
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be<br/>
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up<br/>
Pussy fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh<br/>
You ain't heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane<br/>
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain<br/>
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained<br/>
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write<br/>
Strong enough to stand in front of a traveling freight train<br/>
Are you trained, to go against Dracula?<br/>
Dragging the record industry by my fangs<br/>
AK clips, money clips and gold chains<br/>
You walk around with a P-90 like it's the 90s<br/>
Bullet to your temple, you're homicidal, remind me, that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (RZA)]</i><br/>
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothing to fuck with<br/>
Bompton Pirus ain't nothing to fuck with<br/>
Compton eses ain't nothing to fuck with<br/>
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it<br/>
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop, woop-de-woop<br/>
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop (California dungeons)<br/>
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop, woop-de-woop<br/>
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop (California dungeons)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Let's hit the county building, gotta cash my check<br/>
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck<br/>
And in retrospect I remember December being the hottest<br/>
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas<br/>
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics<br/>
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it<br/>
I'm driving on E with no license or registration<br/>
Heart racing, racing past Johnny because he's racist<br/>
1987, the children on Ronald Reagan<br/>
raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch<br/>
(I'm really out here nigga) You blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress<br/>
(Like, really out here) He copping some blow, hoping that he can stretch<br/>
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger<br/>
with calendars, cause your day coming<br/>
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hoping that you fast enough<br/>
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothing, because<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?<br/>
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there<br/>
When you fight don't fight fair, cause you'll never win<br/>
(Right, I had the chopper and I tore they ass up)<br/>
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?<br/>
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there<br/>
When you fight don't fight fair, cause you'll never win, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
We really out here my nigga, you niggas don't understand my nigga<br/>
I'm off of pill and Remy Red my nigga, tripping my nigga
