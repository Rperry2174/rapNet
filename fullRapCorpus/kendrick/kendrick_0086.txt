<i>[Anna Wise &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor<br/>
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal<br/>
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor<br/>
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal<br/>
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow<br/>
And this I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk<br/>
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk<br/>
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I’m drunk<br/>
How can I can make them popular, pop em’ when I want<br/>
See I’m livin’ with anxiety, duckin’ the sobriety<br/>
Fuckin’ up the system I ain’t fuckin’ with society<br/>
Justice ain’t free, therefore justice ain’t me<br/>
So I justify his name on obituary<br/>
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?<br/>
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God<br/>
Now I’m thinkin’ to myself, hollow tips is all I got<br/>
Now I’m drinkin’ by myself, at the intersection, parked<br/>
Watch you when you walk inside your house<br/>
You threw your briefcase all on the couch<br/>
I plan on creeping through your fuckin’ door and blowin’ out<br/>
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms<br/>
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain<br/>
I’m gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anna Wise:]</i><br/>
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor<br/>
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal<br/>
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Punch &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin’ the handle<br/>
Lit off henny, I’m tryna dismantle<br/>
These wicked ways, I’ve engaged in such a gamble<br/>
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait<br/>
That’s a bit ambitious maybe I’m trippin’<br/>
Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension<br/>
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance<br/>
It’s such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night<br/>
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall<br/>
Studied the son of God but still don’t recognize my flaws<br/>
I guess I’m lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful<br/>
I pray my experience helps you<br/>
As for me I’m tryna sort it out<br/>
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul<br/>
But who knows?<br/>
I just need a little space to breathe<br/>
I know perception is key, so I am king<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind<br/>
The borderline between insanity is father time<br/>
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I’m blind<br/>
I know that I’m intelligence, my confidence just died<br/>
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can’t compromise<br/>
A tape worm couldn’t cure this gluttonous appetite<br/>
A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify<br/>
But couldn’t fathom the meaning of seein’ sacrifice<br/>
I’m passin’ lives on a daily, maybe I’m losing faith<br/>
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate<br/>
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date<br/>
Professional dream killers reason why I’m awake<br/>
I’m sleep walkin’, I’m street stalkin’, I’m outta place<br/>
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes<br/>
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?<br/>
Or this is just a mirage or a facade<br/>
Wait
