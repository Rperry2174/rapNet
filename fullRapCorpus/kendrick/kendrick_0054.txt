<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
If Pirus and Crips all got along<br/>
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song<br/>
Seem like the whole city go against me<br/>
Every time I'm in the street I hear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[ScHoolBoy Q:]</i><br/>
"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
"Man down. Where you from, nigga?"<br/>
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"<br/>
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"<br/>
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane<br/>
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine<br/>
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain<br/>
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain<br/>
It was me, O-Boogy, Yaya, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans<br/>
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self<br/>
Uh, warriors and Conans<br/>
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society<br/>
The driver seat the first one to get killed<br/>
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out<br/>
At the same burger stand, where *censored* hang out<br/>
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it<br/>
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different<br/>
That was back when I was nine<br/>
Joey packed the nine<br/>
Pack to stand on every porch is fine<br/>
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time<br/>
With the sliding door, fuck is up?<br/>
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up?<br/>
You fucking punk, picking up the fucking pump<br/>
Picking off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch<br/>
A wall of bullets coming from<br/>
AK's, AR's, "aye y'all. Duck."<br/>
That's what momma said when we was eating that free lunch<br/>
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose<br/>
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce<br/>
Now crawl yo head in that noose<br/>
You wind up dead on the news<br/>
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces<br/>
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies<br/>
IV's on top of IV's<br/>
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys<br/>
When you hop on that trolley<br/>
Make sure your colors correct<br/>
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect<br/>
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except<br/>
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat<br/>
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec<br/>
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess<br/>
M.A.A.d city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
"Man down<br/>
Where you from, nigga?"<br/>
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"<br/>
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"<br/>
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
If Pirus and Crips all got along<br/>
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song<br/>
Seem like the whole city go against me<br/>
Every time I'm in the street I hear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[ScHoolBoy Q:]</i><br/>
"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MC Eiht:]</i><br/>
Wake yo punk ass up!<br/>
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang<br/>
Chyea<br/>
Real simple and plain<br/>
I'm a teach you some lessons about the street<br/>
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang<br/>
Chyea<br/>
How we do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad<br/>
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad<br/>
Reality struck I seen the white car crash<br/>
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed<br/>
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him<br/>
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving<br/>
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends<br/>
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in<br/>
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up<br/>
Cocaine laced in marijuana<br/>
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now<br/>
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth<br/>
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even<br/>
I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding<br/>
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life<br/>
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mc Eiht:]</i><br/>
Cocaine, weed<br/>
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc<br/>
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds<br/>
Dip<br/>
Make a nigga flip<br/>
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit<br/>
One time's crooked and shit<br/>
Block a nigga in<br/>
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton<br/>
I'm still in the hood<br/>
Loc yeah that's cool<br/>
The hood took me under so I follow the rules<br/>
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang<br/>
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing<br/>
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me<br/>
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately<br/>
Couple of IV's with the fucking spraycan<br/>
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran<br/>
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave<br/>
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave<br/>
Mount up regulators in the whip<br/>
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip<br/>
Trip, we in the hood still<br/>
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real<br/>
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand<br/>
And a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?<br/>
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street<br/>
With a basketball and some Now &amp; Laters to eat<br/>
If I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?<br/>
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?<br/>
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep<br/>
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor<br/>
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage<br/>
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn<br/>
They realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins<br/>
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame<br/>
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and<br/>
They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits<br/>
And the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects<br/>
I live inside the belly of the rough<br/>
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what<br/>
<br/>
