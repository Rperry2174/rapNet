<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Why so sad?<br/>
Walking around with them blue faces<br/>
She said I’m down on my luck<br/>
And it’s something I gotta have<br/>
Blue faces<br/>
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad<br/>
Blue faces<br/>
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey<br/>
<br/>
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you<br/>
But I could never lie with you<br/>
I could never afford not to afford<br/>
I could never put my plans to the side with you<br/>
I could never see a red light<br/>
Like a deer with a headlight<br/>
I freeze up when I re-up<br/>
See I barely have patience<br/>
And you're relating<br/>
Only the moment to complete us<br/>
Why you hate to work for it?<br/>
The reason I never went to work for it<br/>
See a nine to five was so jive turkey<br/>
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me<br/>
You plead the fifth<br/>
I read the Fifth Amendment<br/>
We both criminals with bad intentions<br/>
They say time heals all<br/>
But if I can shortcut<br/>
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow<br/>
<br/>

Why so sad?<br/>
Walking around with them blue faces<br/>
She said I’m down on my luck<br/>
And it’s something I gotta have<br/>
Blue faces<br/>
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad<br/>
Blue faces<br/>
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey<br/>
<br/>
My home girl got a credit card scam<br/>
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn<br/>
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'<br/>
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan<br/>
I know you, woman, I console you, woman<br/>
You feel like the universe owes you, woman<br/>
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it<br/>
Bitches don't prosper chasing education<br/>
But you're talented, and can't handle it<br/>
And your homegirls can't be your manager<br/>
365 times four, plus more<br/>
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?<br/>
But shit, ain't no money like fast money<br/>
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy<br/>
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?<br/>
My accolades better than all them<br/>
<br/>

Walking around with them blue faces<br/>

And it’s something I gotta have<br/>
Blue faces<br/>
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad<br/>
Blue faces<br/>
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby<br/>
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies<br/>
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"<br/>
And I said “why?”<br/>
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"<br/>
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles<br/>
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical<br/>
You settle for everything, complain about everything<br/>
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine<br/>
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch<br/>
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent<br/>
I paid my way through by waiting on Allah<br/>
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi<br/>
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers<br/>
Same thing goes for the ones you came with<br/>
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope<br/>
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope<br/>
These days ain’t no compromise<br/>
And your pain ain’t mines half the time<br/>
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me<br/>
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet<br/>
Cape Town<br/>
<br/>
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out<br/>
You wait on them, him and her<br/>
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong<br/>
You selfish motherfucker<br/>
<br/>

Pimp pimp hooray
