It was always me versus the world<br/>
Until I found it's me versus me<br/>
Why, why, why, why?<br/>
Why, why, why, why?<br/>
Just remember what happens on earth stays on earth!<br/>
We gon' put it in reverse<br/>
<br/>
Darling I told you many times, and I am telling you once again<br/>
Just to remind you sweetheart that my...<br/>
<br/>
Oh Lamar, hail Mary a marijuana, times is hard<br/>
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark<br/>
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star<br/>
Life is one funny motherfucker<br/>
The true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him<br/>
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep<br/>
Introverted by my thoughts<br/>
Children listen, it gets deep<br/>
See once upon a time inside the niggas in garden projects the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect<br/>
Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot<br/>
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals<br/>
Anthony was the oldest of seven, well respected, calm and collected<br/>
Laughin' and joking made life easier<br/>
Hard times, momma on crack, a four year old telling his nanny he needed her<br/>
His family history pimpin' and bangin', he was meant to be dangerous<br/>
Clocked him a grip and start slangin', fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces<br/>
He even got some head from a smoker last weekend<br/>
Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie<br/>
Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him<br/>
Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing<br/>
That's on the daily, seen his first mil twenty years old<br/>
Had a couple of babies<br/>
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case<br/>
Fingerprints on the gun<br/>
They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it<br/>
That was back when they turned his back and they killed his cousin<br/>
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'<br/>
Bird shufflin', Anthony rang<br/>
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang<br/>
That 5.0 thing<br/>
They say 5-0 came circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots<br/>
And hoppin' out while harassin' the corner blocks<br/>
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it<br/>
He brushed them off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken<br/>
See at this chicken spot there was this light-skinned nigga that talked a lot<br/>
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth<br/>
He worked the window, his name was Ducky<br/>
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes<br/>
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome<br/>
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars<br/>
They had a son hoping that he'd see college<br/>
Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it<br/>
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends<br/>
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket<br/>
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it<br/>
Stuck up the place before back in '84, that's when affiliation was really eight gears of war<br/>
So many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works<br/>
Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious, prevalent proposition with nines<br/>
Ducky was well aware, they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year<br/>
He figured he'd get on these niggas good sides, free chicken every time Anthony posted in line<br/>
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide<br/>
They didn't kill him, in fact it look like they're the last to survive<br/>
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives<br/>
One curse at a time, reverse the manifest and good karma and I'll tell you why<br/>
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments<br/>
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it<br/>
Twenty years later them same strangers you make 'em meet again<br/>
Inside recording studios where they reaping the benefits<br/>
Then you start reminding them about that chicken incident<br/>
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence<br/>
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life<br/>
While I grew up without a father and die in a gun fight<br/>
<br/>
So I was taking a walk the other day...
