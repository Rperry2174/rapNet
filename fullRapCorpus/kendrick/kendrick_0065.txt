<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Fuck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe<br/>
<br/>
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess<br/>
Pretty Chick let me see them breast, E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)<br/>
Solo but I'm never alone (that's right), I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)<br/>
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all<br/>
All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC<br/>
It's 82 degrees and my top off, and they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg<br/>
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say, to live and die in LA<br/>
Spend a week on Venice beach - I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye); women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored <br/>
Come and join the wave (aye); girl, what is your name <br/>
Cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you bout (uh); a little something in your rear<br/>
Little something in your mouth, little something on your couch (uh); know now what I'm talkin' about, bring the coffin out<br/>
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it, she said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh)<br/>
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried<br/>
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes<br/>
But when you got the recipe its no surprise, bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Dr. Dre)]</i><br/>
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss<br/>
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York<br/>
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping<br/>
But nothing like my hometown I’m forever living<br/>
Women, weed and weather (they come for) women, weed and weather<br/>
For the women, weed and weather (from all around the world for the) women, weed and weather<br/>
Got that women, weed and weather - don't it sound clever, come and play<br/>
Wh-What more can I say? Welcome to LA<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him, some<br/>
Three W's only for a three day, run<br/>
Bitch, take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no, nun (shit)<br/>
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes<br/>
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control<br/>
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old<br/>
You want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts<br/>
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start<br/>
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me<br/>
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees<br/>
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark<br/>
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts<br/>
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice<br/>
No way hell no, uh uh, if I’m wrong I don't wanna be right<br/>
We want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts<br/>
Women, weed, weather, it’s not my fault, then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled, off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess)<br/>
Everybody know I got that yola, ask (Keisha) she'll confess<br/>
I wake up then I bake up with a bad bitch she ain't got on (No Make Up) (uh)<br/>
Medicated, please my nigga no telling where the high gonna take us, uh<br/>
Three w's, I'm at the W, she got double D's bout to bring trouble through<br/>
OG, Hennessy get their panties wet, I'm trying to dive in the (Swimming Pool)<br/>
Left stroke, right stroke, whats the best stroke, that stroke can smoke all down her throat<br/>
And we blows all kinds of dro, Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
