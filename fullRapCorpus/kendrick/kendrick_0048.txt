<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
I am a sinner<br/>
Who's probably gonna sin again<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Things I don't understand<br/>
Sometimes I need to be alone<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
I can feel your energy from two planets away<br/>
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich<br/>
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist<br/>
I can feel the changes<br/>
I can feel a new life<br/>
I always knew life can be dangerous<br/>
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless<br/>
You don't know what pain is<br/>
How can I paint this picture<br/>
When the color blind is hanging with ya<br/>
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar<br/>
Another mistake living deep in my heart<br/>
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick<br/>
I can admit that it did look like yours<br/>
Why you resent every making of this<br/>
Tell me your purpose is petty again<br/>
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge<br/>
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
I can feel the changes<br/>
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous<br/>
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages<br/>
To me that's amazing<br/>
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
I am a sinner<br/>
Who is probably going to sin again<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Things I don't understand<br/>
Sometimes I need to be alone<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
I can feel your energy from two planets away<br/>
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love<br/>
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does<br/>
And I'm looking right past ya<br/>
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles<br/>
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror<br/>
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior<br/>
This shit is vital, I know you had to<br/>
This shit is vital, I know you had to<br/>
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain<br/>
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain<br/>
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame<br/>
On yourself you can remain, stuck in a box<br/>
Ima break out and then hide every lock<br/>
Ima break out and then hide every lock<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
I can feel the changes<br/>
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous<br/>
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages<br/>
To me that's amazing<br/>
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
I am a sinner<br/>
Who is probably going to sin again<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Things I don't understand<br/>
Sometimes I need to be alone<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
I can feel your energy from two planets away<br/>
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time<br/>
Don't you see that long line<br/>
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th<br/>
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync<br/>
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do<br/>
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive<br/>
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution<br/>
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music<br/>
I say, bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe<br/>
Bitch don't kill my vibe
