When the four corners of this cocoon collide<br/>
You’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive<br/>
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside<br/>
Are you really who they idolize?<br/>
To pimp a butterfly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
At first, I did love you<br/>
But now I just wanna fuck<br/>
Late night thinkin' of you<br/>
Until I got my nut<br/>
Tossed and turned, lesson learned<br/>
You was my first girlfriend<br/>
Bridges burned, all across the board<br/>
Destroyed, but what for?<br/>
<br/>
When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool<br/>
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room<br/>
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies<br/>
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey<br/>
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours<br/>
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four<br/>
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring<br/>
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours<br/>
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap<br/>
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap<br/>
Take a few M-16s to the hood<br/>
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?<br/>
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House<br/>
Republican, run up, get socked out<br/>
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck<br/>
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook x2:]</i><br/>
We should never gave, we should never gave<br/>
Niggas money go back home, money go back home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Yo what's up? It's Dre<br/>
Remember the first time you came out to the house?<br/>
You said you wanted a spot like mine<br/>
But remember, anybody can get it<br/>
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
What you want you? A house or a car?<br/>
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?<br/>
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar<br/>
Motherfucker you can live at the mall<br/>
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)<br/>
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)<br/>
Pay me later, wear those gators<br/>
Cliche and say, fuck your haters<br/>
I can see the borrow in you<br/>
I can see the dollar in you<br/>
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you<br/>
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you<br/>
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby<br/>
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby<br/>
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides<br/>
So you better cop everything two times<br/>
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes<br/>
Too much and enough both we know<br/>
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list<br/>
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick<br/>
And when you get the White House, do you<br/>
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school<br/>
And everything you buy, taxes will deny<br/>
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five<br/>
<br/>
<i>[George Clinton (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)<br/>
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)<br/>
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria<br/>
Look both ways before you cross my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Tax man comin'<br/>
Tax man comin'<br/>
Tax man comin'<br/>
Tax man comin'<br/>
Tax man comin'
