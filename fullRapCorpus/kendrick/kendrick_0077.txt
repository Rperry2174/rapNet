<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Complexion (two-step)<br/>
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)<br/>
Complexion (two-step)<br/>
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)<br/>
<br/>
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun<br/>
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done<br/>
Sneak (dissin’)<br/>
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga<br/>
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you<br/>
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down<br/>
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun<br/>
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run<br/>
Sneak (dissin')<br/>
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga<br/>
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you<br/>
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down<br/>
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention<br/>
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival<br/>
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival<br/>
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken<br/>
By different shades of faces<br/>
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation"<br/>
It all came from God then you was my confirmation<br/>
I came to where you reside<br/>
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes<br/>
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
You like it, I love it<br/>
You like it, I love it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapsody:]</i><br/>
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2pac<br/>
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die<br/>
Color of your skin, color of your eyes<br/>
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby<br/>
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey<br/>
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave<br/>
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark<br/>
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid<br/>
And forcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas<br/>
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid<br/>
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!”<br/>
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored<br/>
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times<br/>
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion<br/>
It ain’t complex to put it in context<br/>
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context<br/>
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest<br/>
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed<br/>
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be<br/>
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey<br/>
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens<br/>
And spike yourself esteem<br/>
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me<br/>
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea<br/>
And it’s all beautiful to me<br/>
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens<br/>
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing<br/>
<br/>
Barefoot babies with no cares<br/>
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?<br/>
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse<br/>
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
