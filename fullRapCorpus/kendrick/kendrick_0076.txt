How much a dollar really cost?<br/>
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts<br/>
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all<br/>
Gotta see how Iâ€™m chillin' once I park this luxury car<br/>
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo<br/>
20 on pump 6, dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo<br/>
20 years ago, can't forget<br/>
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals<br/>
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do<br/>
20 on 6, he didn't hear me<br/>
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu<br/>
My American tongue was slurry<br/>
Walked out the gas station<br/>
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion<br/>
Asked me for 10 Rand <i>[apprrox $1 USD]</i>, stressin' about dry land<br/>
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open<br/>
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'<br/>
He begged and pleaded<br/>
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it<br/>
Told him, "Beat it"<br/>
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it<br/>
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated<br/>
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you<br/>
Nothin' less, nothin' more"<br/>
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door<br/>
Tell me how much a dollar cost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - James Fauntleroy:]</i><br/>
It's more to feed your mind<br/>
Water, sun and love, the one you love<br/>
All you need, the air you breathe<br/>
<br/>
He's starin' at me in disbelief<br/>
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key<br/>
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave<br/>
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see<br/>
The reason why he was mad at a stranger<br/>
Like I was supposed to save him<br/>
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor<br/>
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser<br/>
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious<br/>
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect<br/>
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck<br/>
I never understood someone beggin' for goods<br/>
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could<br/>
And this particular person just had it down pat<br/>
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked<br/>
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?<br/>
A humble man is all that we ever need<br/>
Tell me how much a dollar cost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment<br/>
I never met a transient that demanded attention<br/>
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'<br/>
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different<br/>
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless<br/>
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?<br/>
So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum<br/>
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines<br/>
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time<br/>
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind<br/>
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend<br/>
I smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin<br/>
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'<br/>
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal<br/>
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre<br/>
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus<br/>
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy<br/>
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"<br/>
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"<br/>
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free<br/>
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power<br/>
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit<br/>
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost<br/>
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ronald Isley:]</i><br/>
I wash my hands, I said my grace<br/>
What more do you want from me?<br/>
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be<br/>
Shades of grey will never change if I condone<br/>
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs
