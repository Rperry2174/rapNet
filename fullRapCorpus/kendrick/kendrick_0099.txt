<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Damn, love or lust<br/>
Damn, all of us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Zacari (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
Give me a run for my money<br/>
There is nobody, no one to outrun me<br/>
(Another world premiere!)<br/>
So give me a run for my money<br/>
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely<br/>
Just love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)<br/>
Just love me, just love me, just love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)<br/>
Love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you)<br/>
Love me, just love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar (Zacari):]</i><br/>
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?<br/>
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?<br/>
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)<br/>
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Ay, I got somethin'<br/>
Hold up, we gon' function, no assumptions<br/>
Feelin' like Tyson with it<br/>
Knock it out twice, I'm with it<br/>
Only for the night, I'm kiddin'<br/>
Only for life, you're a homie for life<br/>
You're a homie for life, let's get it<br/>
Hit that shoulder lean<br/>
I know what comin' over mean<br/>
Backstroke oversea<br/>
I know what you need<br/>
Already on ten, our money come in<br/>
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought<br/>
This party won't end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar (Zacari):]</i><br/>
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?<br/>
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?<br/>
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)<br/>
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'<br/>

So give me a run for my money<br/>
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely<br/>
Just love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)<br/>
Just love me, just love me, just love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)<br/>
Love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you)<br/>
Love me, just love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I'm on the way<br/>
We ain't got no time to waste<br/>
Poppin' your gum on the way<br/>
Am I in the way?<br/>
I don't wan' pressure you none<br/>
I want your blessing today<br/>
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way<br/>
Told you that I'm on the way<br/>
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague<br/>
Pick up the phone for me, babe<br/>
Damn it, we jammin'<br/>
Bad attitude from your nanny<br/>
Curves and your hips from your mammy<br/>
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera<br/>
I know Top will be mad at me<br/>
I had to do it, I want your body, your music<br/>
I bought the big one to prove it<br/>
Look what you made<br/>
Told you that I'm on the way<br/>
I'm like an exit away, yep<br/>
<br/>

Just love me, just love me, just love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)<br/>
Love me<br/>
(I wanna be with you)<br/>
Love me, just love me
