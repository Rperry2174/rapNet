<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
One time<br/>
Reporting live, Compton, California<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?<br/>
Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep<br/>
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep<br/>
Chasing for the win but you never win the track meet<br/>
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter<br/>
and life's a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her<br/>
I struck enough pain, let her know I wasn't playing<br/>
I was so (Sincere) like Nas' first name<br/>
And back, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five<br/>
and if I survive I probably wouldn't sell it<br/>
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats<br/>
in the ghetto, rather in some heals like Giuseppe's<br/>
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets<br/>
for filling voids of broke D-boys selling weed<br/>
Fucking up my prestige, till I live with the blues<br/>
B.B. King or the neighbors of Snoop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {uncredited female}]</i><br/>
That's why I'm in the club like fuck it though<br/>
They say it's only one life, life, life<br/>
And if you say I can't live comfortable<br/>
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie<br/>
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass<br/>
Celebrate the very day that I get past<br/>
(Through the barbed wire)<br/>
{We are, we are fighters<br/>
We are, we are true<br/>
Through the, through barbed wires<br/>
We will, will break through}<br/>
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass<br/>
Celebrate the very day that I get past<br/>
(Through the barbed wire)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?<br/>
Like you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep<br/>
Tryna get away from the world stereotype<br/>
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny<br/>
She desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying<br/>
She gon' have a baby, then flee from her education<br/>
At the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes<br/>
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality<br/>
She will never get by, no how, no way<br/>
Welfare recipient, property of the state<br/>
Housing, Section 8, corner store, prostitute<br/>
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she cute<br/>
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies<br/>
and this baby daddy is new to the family<br/>
Chilling in pajamies, waiting on the first<br/>
Fast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {uncredited female}]</i><br/>
That's why she in the club like fuck it though<br/>
They say it's only one life, life, life<br/>
And if you say she can't live comfortable<br/>
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie<br/>
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass<br/>
Celebrate the very day that she get past<br/>
(Through the barbed wire)<br/>
{We are, we are fighters<br/>
We are, we are true<br/>
Through the, through barbed wires<br/>
We will, will break through}<br/>
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass<br/>
Celebrate the very day that she get past<br/>
(Through the barbed wire)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Have you ever felt like you finally got life?<br/>
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep<br/>
Living off your (dreams) like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat<br/>
of a convertible, eloping to get married<br/>
What a feeling of overcoming the odds<br/>
It's like you just hit the lottery, my God<br/>
There must be a God, cause golly<br/>
you done made it through the fight while squabbling, Ali<br/>
Now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops<br/>
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks<br/>
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar<br/>
Making good decisions, got an independent business mind<br/>
And both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way<br/>
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day<br/>
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth<br/>
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser)]</i><br/>
In the club like fuck it though<br/>
They say it's only one life, life, life<br/>
And if you say they can't live comfortable<br/>
They gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie<br/>
So even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad<br/>
Know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path<br/>
(Through the barbed wire)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Just laugh, then everybody say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ash Riser]</i><br/>
Cause I won't get caught again<br/>
and I'm here to start the trend<br/>
You can't catch me if you try<br/>
Disappear into the night, and I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
"So you made it past all the barbed wires?"<br/>
Just one more left <i>[gun shot]</i>
