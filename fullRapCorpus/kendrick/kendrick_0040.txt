In time you'll learn this is about you <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Babies from 80s don't know no better<br/>
Don't nothing go better with ignorance<br/>
But the belligerent kids that we living with<br/>
Some of them masculine, some of the feminine<br/>
'Member the universe used to be innocent<br/>
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants<br/>
Everyday that I wake up, I'ma sin again<br/>
I'm not a citizen<br/>
I'm just a nigga from Section.80<br/>
<br/>
Show of hands, how many been taking notes?<br/>
Good<br/>
Leave everything on the table now<br/>
On the real<br/>
This is your generation<br/>
Show, show your pain
