<i>[DJ Dahi:]</i><br/>
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)<br/>
All I want tonight is just get high up (high, high, high)<br/>
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)<br/>
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar &amp; Rihanna:]</i><br/>
It's a secret society<br/>
All we ask is trust<br/>
(All we ask is trust)<br/>
All we got is us<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Kung Fu Kenny now<br/>
My resume is real enough for two millenniums<br/>
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them<br/>
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again<br/>
I'm hangin' on the fence again<br/>
I'm always on your mind<br/>
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line<br/>
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind<br/>
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now<br/>
(Only for the dollar sign)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
Bad girl RiRi now<br/>
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now<br/>
On your pulse like it's EDM<br/>
Gas in the bitch like it's premium<br/>
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane<br/>
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came<br/>
I'm established<br/>
Hundred carats on my name<br/>
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar &amp; Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king<br/>
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock (yeah)<br/>
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)<br/>
You can babysit him when I leave him outside<br/>
Ain't no other love like the one I know<br/>
I done been down so long lost hope<br/>
I done came down so hard I slowed<br/>
Honesty forever, all a real nigga want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Dahi:]</i><br/>
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)<br/>
All I want tonight is just get high up (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
(All I want is, all I want is)<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar (Rihanna):]</i><br/>
(10-4, no switchin' sides)<br/>
Feel somethin' wrong<br/>
(You actin' shifty, you don't ride)<br/>
With me no more, I need<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Tell me who you loyal to<br/>
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?<br/>
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?<br/>
Big chillin', only for the power in your name<br/>
Tell me who you loyal to<br/>
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?<br/>
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?<br/>
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
Tell me who you loyal to<br/>
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)<br/>
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)<br/>
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?<br/>
I said, tell me who you loyal to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar &amp; Rihanna:]</i><br/>
Is it anybody that you would lie for?<br/>
Anybody you would slide for?<br/>
Anybody you would die for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
That's what God for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Dahi:]</i><br/>
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)<br/>
All I want tonight is just get high up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
(All I want is, all I want is)<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar &amp; Rihanna:]</i><br/>
10-4, no switchin' sides<br/>
Feel somethin' wrong<br/>
You actin' shifty, you don't ride<br/>
With me no more, I need<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty<br/>
<br/>
It's so hard to be humble<br/>
It's so hard to be<br/>
Lord knows I'm tryin'<br/>
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby
