I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't<br/>
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick<br/>
Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given<br/>
The only thing that I can identify within this bidness<br/>
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap<br/>
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?<br/>
I never killed a man, never sold any crack<br/>
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map<br/>
But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win<br/>
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends<br/>
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?<br/>
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, hell no<br/>
They say anything worth having is worth the wait<br/>
Well I want the world, tell me how long that takes<br/>
There's no time like now, I can cut my patience/patients short<br/>
or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown<br/>
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it<br/>
you won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own bidness?<br/>
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him<br/>
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him<br/>
Well I'm a broke nigga<br/>
But still I wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga<br/>
Pfttuh<br/>
<br/>
See I was brought up different<br/>
Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen<br/>
You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it<br/>
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it<br/>
Oh-no-oh-oh<br/>
I swear we got to fast-forward...<br/>
<br/>
Before time flies by<br/>
My new sound for '0-10 is, why lie?<br/>
And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?<br/>
Now you can low-ball or give me high five<br/>
This is I nigga, look into my eye<br/>
Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar<br/>
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar<br/>
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar<br/>
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all<br/>
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh<br/>
<br/>
And that used to be a hell of a task<br/>
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass<br/>
my character like it don't carry a<br/>
confidence that can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash<br/>
I'm bout to cash in my thoughts<br/>
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost<br/>
What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom<br/>
Once the 'Eves' come, they quick to stare 'Adam'/at him<br/>
Hoping I don't take they bitch, but I'm on some other shit<br/>
When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government<br/>
They are big dreams<br/>
Transition from a rapper to a human being, you can't 'school' a dean<br/>
I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience<br/>
All cause they all oversaw it, my God<br/>
Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience<br/>
All because who I are, Lamar<br/>
<br/>
But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar<br/>
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar<br/>
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all<br/>
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go<br/>
But we can't go... backwards
