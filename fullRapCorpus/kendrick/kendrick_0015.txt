<i>[Intro: excerpt from interview with Dash Snow]</i><br/>
I'll tell you what I don't believe in, can I do that?<br/>
Alright, I don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever<br/>
I try not to obey them at any time<br/>
That's what I believe in, not believing in<br/>
(So what keeps you alive?)<br/>
Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds and<br/>
uh, what keeps me alive? Shit, um<br/>
Music, I have to listen to music all day long<br/>
I say that keeps me going<br/>
I'm a pretty dark person, I've thought about ending it a million times<br/>
and I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Thank you<br/>
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go<br/>
right now, freestyle or write down, whatever<br/>
And still I come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts<br/>
and Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect<br/>
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses<br/>
You should either hear me now or go deaf<br/>
or end up dead, die trying and know death<br/>
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath<br/>
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga<br/>
I mean that from the bottom of my heart<br/>
You see my art is all I have, and victory tastes sweet<br/>
even when the enemy can throw salt<br/>
Still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car<br/>
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from<br/>
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young<br/>
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga<br/>
inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas<br/>
My uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight<br/>
He told me rap about life, not rap, niggas<br/>
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissing<br/>
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching<br/>
I start evaluating, then my final intuition<br/>
is that you wishing a come up, would just come up<br/>
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse<br/>
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre<br/>
And this is Compton, lions in the land of the triumph<br/>
Wrap Saran our defiance, ban our alliance<br/>
Put burners in the hands of the black man<br/>
One hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned Kobe Bryant<br/>
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am<br/>
You probably even listen to "Faith" and think I know Zion<br/>
But really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth<br/>
because it seem like it's always clashing with science<br/>
I got a big fear of flying<br/>
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying<br/>
I swear to God half of y'all just don't know Kendrick<br/>
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance<br/>
You walking down the block, he got shot, you wouldn't know I witnessed<br/>
You just mind your bidness<br/>
You just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennises<br/>
It's kinda scary ain't it<br/>
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous<br/>
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?<br/>
Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him<br/>
so much, you probably had your burner tucked in graduation<br/>
Said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing<br/>
twenty-five to life with a murder charge<br/>
Your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to God<br/>
I pray these bars get farther than Compton<br/>
And if my record never break I still won't break my promise, I promise to keep it honest<br/>
Secret society, all we ask is trust<br/>
and all we lack is communication like service sucks<br/>
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come<br/>
And I'm like, the Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month<br/>
Alright? Gotta keep it pushing<br/>
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking<br/>
I'm on Rosecrans &amp; Central trying to duck the central bookings<br/>
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking, never will I surrender<br/>
I've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta<br/>
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter<br/>
How splendid, I guess my project had did it<br/>
Got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different<br/>
They said seven tracks, I said fifteen<br/>
Called it an EP, they said I'm tripping<br/>
But little did they know, I'm tryna change the rules<br/>
that we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions<br/>
Uppity bitches, handling bidness<br/>
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision<br/>
Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home<br/>
In L.A. everybody think they fucking on<br/>
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit<br/>
Who we hanging with, and bragging about the iPhone<br/>
I swear to God, most y'all cats just don't know Kendrick<br/>
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended<br/>
Ain't doing this for my health, I'm just trying to purchase my momma them businesses<br/>
Occupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's<br/>
just to coincide, just to go inside, books we idolize while we living<br/>
Look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to mastermind<br/>
Just to master grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the... <i>[coughs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
We would like to call this an appreciation tape<br/>
for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP<br/>
For this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D.<br/>
Because of you, we are Overly Dedicated
