<i>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish<br/>
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish<br/>
Home invasion was persuasive<br/>
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish<br/>
Dreams of living life like rappers do<br/>
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool<br/>
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros<br/>
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on<br/>
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish<br/>
Parked the car and then we start rhyming, ya bish<br/>
The only thing we had to free our mind<br/>
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs<br/>
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish<br/>
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish<br/>
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew<br/>
Go at a reverend for the revenue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah<br/>
Pick your poison tell me what you doin'<br/>
Everybody gon' respect the shooter<br/>
But the one in front of the gun lives forever<br/>
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way<br/>
Through canals and alleyways, just to say<br/>
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel, now, now<br/>
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel, now<br/>
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel, now<br/>
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel, now<br/>
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel, now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Dreams of living life like rappers do<br/>
Bump that new E-40 at the school<br/>
You know big ballin with my homies<br/>
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational<br/>
Back to reality we poor, ya bish<br/>
Another casualty at war, ya bish<br/>
Two bullets in my uncle tony head<br/>
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish<br/>
That Louie's Burger never be the same<br/>
A louis belt will never ease that pain<br/>
But I'm a purchase when that day is jerkin'<br/>
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'<br/>
Gang signs out the window, ya bish<br/>
Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish<br/>
They say your hood is a pot of gold<br/>
And we gone crash it when nobodies home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x2: Anna Wise]</i><br/>
Be the last one out to get this dough?, No Way<br/>
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way<br/>
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way<br/>
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No Way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets<br/>
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping<br/>
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving<br/>
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him<br/>
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustling<br/>
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government<br/>
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch<br/>
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch<br/>
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash<br/>
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass<br/>
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood<br/>
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good<br/>
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is<br/>
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is<br/>
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees<br/>
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i>
