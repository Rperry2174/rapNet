Reporting live, Compton California<br/>
The good kid<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of doing it<br/>
the same way, gotta flip it before I ruin it<br/>
Make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it<br/>
Opinions get thrown out the window with Ron Browz<br/>
So turn me up loud so the world can hear<br/>
And when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears<br/>
and go death, go death I said<br/>
Go death and stay dead, a shot to the forehead to kill 'em<br/>
But I ain't here for no ignorance<br/>
I'm militant as Martin Luther King and a penalty<br/>
Aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off<br/>
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen<br/>
I've got in it my genes, you probably think I'm talking bout a pistol<br/>
but I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior<br/>
My nigga, what you worry for? I ain't tryna jock your swag<br/>
I'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
As time flies, hope that I'm soaring<br/>
Far from the boring, I'ma<br/>
tell you why, it's important<br/>
I'm not the boring, I'ma<br/>
If I think and act like you do<br/>
the world will die from not seeing something new<br/>
And if I don't speak on how I feel<br/>
the world will lose out on what's really real<br/>
And if I should die before I wake<br/>
I pray my music could take my place<br/>
in the world... The Relevant<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather you call me that<br/>
than a typical artist you call wack<br/>
on a YouTube blog holding ARs and stacks<br/>
of ones, but never could be the one<br/>
to rally communities or lead a crowd of blacks<br/>
Passion is too strong, I'm pissed off<br/>
So there's a chance you get pissed on, R. Kelly was in the wrong<br/>
But that don't make you an exempt<br/>
That don't make you a no-go from hitting the fence<br/>
You ain't a blood and damn sure you ain't a crip<br/>
The crowd yell "hoe" but I ain't a pimp<br/>
I'm me, I'm free as a five-finger discount<br/>
See you on the flip side right after I dismount<br/>
If I ever feel like I ain't pushing myself<br/>
I'll find a cliff, then push myself off the edge<br/>
like a barber at the tip of your head<br/>
That's how I settle it, life or death if I ain't relevant, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
So feel free to not mind me<br/>
if you're used to boosters, drug dealers and shooters on wax<br/>
Cause most of y'all niggas fabricate facts anyway<br/>
I could easily cheat and let the four-four play like a two-on-two orgy<br/>
But I've been there and it bores me<br/>
Got to the point where it did nothing for me<br/>
At forty I want to afford not to record bullshit in my story<br/>
And I'm mad young, so I'd rather do it now before my career's done<br/>
This is pain plus glory, victory is here<br/>
If I cried, you could see strength and pride in my tears<br/>
I do it for the kids<br/>
I do it for the twenty-three hour lockdowns doing time in the pen<br/>
And my pen is the only thing I got for Hip Hop to change the game<br/>
and they'll remember my name as The Relevant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
