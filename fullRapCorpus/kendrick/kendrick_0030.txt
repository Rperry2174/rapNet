<i>[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
The homies say I'm the truest<br/>
The bitches think I'm the cutest<br/>
The definition what cool is<br/>
Boy, I thought you knew this<br/>
Bitch I do this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Y-O]</i><br/>
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes<br/>
with no corns but enjoys eating vegetables<br/>
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes<br/>
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes<br/>
Mr. Michael of <i>[?]</i> speaking<br/>
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln<br/>
I hear they fell in love with my penis<br/>
Only concerned with my balls like Venus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thurz]</i><br/>
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot<br/>
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top<br/>
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch<br/>
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock<br/>
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot<br/>
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop<br/>
on that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me<br/>
I'm still serving broads on my chest for gratuity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
The homies say I'm the truest<br/>
The bitches think I'm the cutest<br/>
The definition what cool is<br/>
Boy, I thought you knew this<br/>
Bitch I do this<br/>
Bitch I do this<br/>
Bitch I do this<br/>
The definition what cool is<br/>
Boy, I thought you knew this<br/>
Bitch I do this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skeme]</i><br/>
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again<br/>
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in<br/>
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again<br/>
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!<br/>
Got the world going crazy<br/>
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me<br/>
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling<br/>
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Brown]</i><br/>
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me<br/>
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie<br/>
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing<br/>
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci<br/>
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me<br/>
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County<br/>
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras<br/>
Hoes are choosing me cause hating we ain't, pimping, keep our balance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
These hoes want to love me mayne<br/>
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?<br/>
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting<br/>
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses<br/>
Chunking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won<br/>
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously<br/>
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude<br/>
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you<br/>
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC<br/>
I'm bout to make that halo burn, goddamn that's some irony<br/>
I am the messiah of society<br/>
Beside of Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui<br/>
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief<br/>
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I do this<br/>
Bitch I do this<br/>
The definition what cool is<br/>
Boy, I thought you knew this<br/>
Bitch I do this
