Dick hard like Rottweiler<br/>
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo<br/>
<br/>
The whole industry been in shambles<br/>
Everybody fugazi, I'm just changing the channel<br/>
Kendrick Lamar, the people's champion, I'm animal for analysts<br/>
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit<br/>
I like my raps extra prolific<br/>
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches<br/>
And I won't mention my ten thousand hours in training<br/>
While juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous<br/>
And now we look at the competition as quick submission<br/>
They tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss â€˜em<br/>
What this about, is it money or skill?<br/>
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts of it, it's real<br/>
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable<br/>
I can see y'all incapable<br/>
To be the God emcees, you know me well<br/>
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister<br/>
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself<br/>
I'm rollin' deep in that paper like two Adeles<br/>
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips<br/>
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence<br/>
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays<br/>
It's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays<br/>
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays<br/>
It's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking<br/>
Hiiigher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer<br/>
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock<br/>
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion<br/>
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!<br/>
This is what they want, I'm the one<br/>
This is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'<br/>
I'm the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun<br/>
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump<br/>
I'm yelling Mr. Kanye West for president<br/>
He probably let me get some head inside the residence<br/>
I'm in the White House going all out<br/>
Bumping College Dropout, God-bless Americans<br/>
Nothing more influential than rap music<br/>
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music<br/>
I mix black soul with some rock and roll<br/>
They never box me in, I'm David Blaine-ing all you hoes<br/>
Oh yea, let's go there, my DNA is DMT, I'm so rare<br/>
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia<br/>
A locomotive couldn't track me down in my career<br/>
Runnin' this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish<br/>
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?<br/>
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California<br/>
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him<br/>
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain't for him<br/>
Probably thinking it's for him, only one me<br/>
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign<br/>
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them<br/>
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them<br/>
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them<br/>
I'm snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin'<br/>
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman<br/>
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning<br/>
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it's important<br/>
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous<br/>
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments<br/>
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)<br/>
I tell a bitch don't sweat me (Don't sweat me)<br/>
I kill this whole fuckin' beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)<br/>
Ib should've never sent the instrumental<br/>
Every time I start writing I get sentimental<br/>
This shit is just not fair<br/>
But why the fuck should I care?<br/>
The story of your life here<br/>
Two young stars was born and y'all gon' die here<br/>
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams<br/>
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn<br/>
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah<br/>
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance<br/>
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me<br/>
Is not validation, nigga this TDE<br/>
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings<br/>
And casualties all around me, don't make me do demonstrations<br/>
Whoa<br/>
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces<br/>
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments<br/>
I'm sorry y'all not relating, this party is reservated<br/>
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it<br/>
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it<br/>
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I'm not to play with<br/>
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin' greatest<br/>
Whoa<br/>
Burnin' my leather-<br/>
(Nah I'm just fuckin' wit cha)
