K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail.<br/>
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga.<br/>
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo<br/>
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo<br/>
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo<br/>
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo<br/>
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce<br/>
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies<br/>
On the dead homies<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga<br/>
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga<br/>
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga<br/>
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga<br/>
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game<br/>
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game<br/>
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up<br/>
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up<br/>
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock<br/>
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"<br/>
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix<br/>
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras<br/>
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers<br/>
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you<br/>
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked<br/>
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"<br/>
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?<br/>
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio<br/>
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous<br/>
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras<br/>
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'<br/>
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer<br/>
The streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town<br/>
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around<br/>
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans<br/>
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?<br/>
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs<br/>
Make it they promise to fuck with you<br/>
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that<br/>
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black<br/>
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’<br/>
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum<br/>
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit<br/>
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since<br/>
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows<br/>
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes<br/>
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it<br/>
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button<br/>
Had the Coast on standby<br/>
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”<br/>
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide<br/>
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets<br/>
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats<br/>
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay<br/>
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"<br/>
<br/>
I remember you was conflicted<br/>
Misusing your influence<br/>
Sometimes I did the same<br/>
Abusing my power full of resentment<br/>
Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br/>
Found myself screaming in a hotel room<br/>
I didn't want to self-destruct<br/>
The evils of Lucy was all around me<br/>
So I went running for answers<br/>
Until I came home<br/>
But that didn't stop survivors guilt<br/>
Going back and forth<br/>
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned<br/>
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was<br/>
But while my loved ones was fighting<br/>
A continuous war back in the city<br/>
I was entering a new one
