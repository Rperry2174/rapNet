<i>[Chorus: Astro Bot]</i><br/>
Fancy girls, on Long Beach Boulevard<br/>
Flagging down all of these flashy cars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful<br/>
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore<br/>
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles<br/>
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more<br/>
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper<br/>
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her<br/>
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen<br/>
The seven cars start honking, she start running<br/>
like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow<br/>
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go<br/>
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars<br/>
Just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic<br/>
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked<br/>
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where<br/>
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat<br/>
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
And Lord knows she's beautiful<br/>
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore<br/>
Her anatomy is God's temple<br/>
and it's quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed<br/>
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets<br/>
Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys<br/>
Remember sergeant let her slide<br/>
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise<br/>
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him<br/>
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel<br/>
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables<br/>
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em<br/>
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked<br/>
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where<br/>
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat<br/>
cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
And Lord knows she's beautiful<br/>
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore<br/>
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour<br/>
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure<br/>
of the black man, white man, needing satisfaction<br/>
At first it became a practice, but now she's numb to it<br/>
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it<br/>
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption<br/>
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother<br/>
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover<br/>
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her<br/>
This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing<br/>
through that block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked<br/>
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where<br/>
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat<br/>
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street<br/>
Keisha's song<br/>
<br/>
Mm, my little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face<br/>
the day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2X]</i>
