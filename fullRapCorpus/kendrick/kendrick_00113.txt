And this is for the homies<br/>
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie<br/>
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee<br/>
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...<br/>
<br/>
Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown<br/>
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac brown<br/>
Looking for E.T. to phone home<br/>
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days<br/>
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains<br/>
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons<br/>
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion<br/>
That's fashion if you come where I'm from<br/>
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun<br/>
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me<br/>
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip<br/>
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack<br/>
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that<br/>
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good<br/>
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies<br/>
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers<br/>
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And this is for the homies<br/>
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie<br/>
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee<br/>
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on<br/>
And if you feel good (hey)<br/>
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)<br/>
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)<br/>
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on<br/>
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on<br/>
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on<br/>
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on<br/>
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on<br/>
<br/>
As I continue my day, quite copacetic<br/>
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell<br/>
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas<br/>
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past<br/>
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em<br/>
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom<br/>
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites<br/>
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions<br/>
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima<br/>
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good<br/>
The homies hanging on <i>[?]</i> and Monte Carlos<br/>
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty<br/>
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to<br/>
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?<br/>
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G<br/>
If you can't relate then please have a seat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known<br/>
And put on for the soil of which you was grown<br/>
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors<br/>
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers<br/>
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts<br/>
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck<br/>
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck<br/>
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us<br/>
This ain't for you, so what?!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
