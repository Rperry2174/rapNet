<i>[Chorus: screwed Pimp C sample from Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin'" (Kendrick Lamar)]</i><br/>
"Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup<br/>
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck<br/>
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall<br/>
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all"<br/>
(Pussy ass hoe niggas) "I can't fuck with y'all"<br/>
(Bitches all up in my business) "I can't fuck with y'all"<br/>
(Industry of counterfeits) "I can't fuck with y'all"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Taking off when you landing<br/>
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums<br/>
And I'm dancing on them stars<br/>
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all<br/>
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all<br/>
while I'm here, and every day I hear<br/>
your bullshit, self-pity<br/>
Reason why you never dealt with me<br/>
Reason why your girl dealt with me<br/>
Hands up in the building, we get busy, and say<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep<br/>
That's exactly what this sound like<br/>
A to the A to the L-I-Y<br/>
A-H, give it up two times<br/>
Then give it right back, don't blow my high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Look at my life, then look at yours<br/>
Get some ambition, why you bored?<br/>
Time will never wait on no man<br/>
Society will never hold your hand<br/>
Niggas like to gossip like bitches<br/>
Got me thinking you don't like bitches<br/>
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans<br/>
Eyes of a coward, I understand<br/>
Niggas like to gossip like bitches<br/>
Sip Don Perignon, when we finish, we say<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep<br/>
That's exactly what this sound like<br/>
But never will I ever forget Left Eye<br/>
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky<br/>
and a button on your lips, don't blow my high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Now everybody sing this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[sung by Aaliyah]</i><br/>
I'm sending him a four-page letter<br/>
and I enclose it with a kiss<br/>
And when I write, he'll be better<br/>
Get it on time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Look at my life and look at yours<br/>
Get some ambition, why you bored?<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P<br/>
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
