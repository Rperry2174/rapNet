<i>[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Abba Zabba<br/>
You know we get in the studio and do what we do best, you know?<br/>
Beautiful shit<br/>
But this time around I want to do something different homeboy<br/>
You feel me my nig'?<br/>
Hop on them keys real quick my nig'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like<br/>
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight<br/>
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like<br/>
Yeah, ha-ha-ha, yeah<br/>
This shit my girlfriend will like<br/>
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight<br/>
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Check me out, she say she love it when it sounds like this<br/>
She tell me Kendrick, put it down like this<br/>
When I listen I want to close my eyes and feel your lips<br/>
Let your lyrics wrap/rap around me and grab my hips<br/>
So enticing, on point like the helmet of a viking<br/>
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking<br/>
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one<br/>
I be calling my woman so I can get some<br/>
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard<br/>
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard<br/>
Composing myself, tryna remain content<br/>
She had a long day and plus I know she want to vent<br/>
Now she can talk about her boss and I can give advice<br/>
or she can take the panties off and I can eat the pie<br/>
Fuck that, option number deuce<br/>
On the kitchen table while I play this tune, you know why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This shit that my girlfriend will like<br/>
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight<br/>
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like<br/>
Ha-ha-ha, yeah<br/>
This shit my girlfriend will like<br/>
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight<br/>
Abba, this shit my girlfriend will like my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Look, we be in the car bumping my latest jam<br/>
I recorded at the studio around 10 P.M.<br/>
It's a club banger, catchy hooks and 808s<br/>
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe<br/>
The first eight bars she loving the track<br/>
Even rewinding it back soon as the beat drop<br/>
The way she react, she like that's hot<br/>
till I start talking how many hoes I got<br/>
How many I've fucked, how many I've misled<br/>
just to get a nut like a squirrel in pursuit of lunch, uh<br/>
Though I'm on some cliche rapper shit<br/>
I know she thinking all my lyrics, they're accurate<br/>
She so cool though<br/>
Don't downplay it just to fuck up the mood yo<br/>
She will still play it even though I sound rude yo<br/>
and disregards to them provocative records, one thing that I do know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3: Kendrick Lamar (Ab-Soul)]</i><br/>
This something that my girlfriend will like<br/>
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight<br/>
I'm playing something that my girlfriend will like<br/>
Ne-ma-ne-ma-ne-ma-nem <i>[laughter]</i><br/>
Told you that my girlfriend would like...<br/>
... other hoes tonight<br/>
'Soul! (This shit my girlfriend will like too, haha)<br/>
(Kendrick, I got you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
This a great idea<br/>
This will be girlfriend joint right here<br/>
So I'ma kick the shit she like, it seem right<br/>
like a pair of jeans that fit tight around her cute booty<br/>
I like to hold her from behind in line<br/>
at the movies, her body-language gets read<br/>
like a ruby, cause she a work of art<br/>
No help from Julie, I'm a beast and she's such a beauty<br/>
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her<br/>
Far from a narc but best under cover<br/>
Kodak moment every time we in sync<br/>
like an iPod plugged to a USB<br/>
It's just you and me, I mean me and her<br/>
I mean her and I, it's plain to see, affirmative<br/>
So if you ever need me, you know where Herbert is<br/>
On her mind like she on mine, uh<br/>
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like<br/>
cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight<br/>
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend would write<br/>
if she was me talking bout her, DJ...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Play some shit that my girlfriend will like<br/>
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight<br/>
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend would like<br/>
Now I'm sure to get some cutty
