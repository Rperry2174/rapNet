<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I miss you, where you been?<br/>
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you<br/>
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me<br/>
Come back, I need you in my life<br/>
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dom Kennedy]</i><br/>
What's up baby? It's been a while<br/>
You been good? I've been around<br/>
different girls, different towns<br/>
To keep it real, you missing out<br/>
I'll all bored, next city<br/>
Random cars, TEC's with me<br/>
Like I miss you so much, have sex with me<br/>
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me<br/>
She like fuck that, I don't care Dom<br/>
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom<br/>
Meet me here, where Dom?<br/>
Get undressed, yeah Dom<br/>
Yeah Dom, what you need?<br/>
Some bomb head? A bag of weed?<br/>
Good food? Japanese?<br/>
That's me on page forty in that magazine<br/>
"Dom Kennedy" you need that<br/>
She said nobody come close, I agreed back<br/>
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weed back<br/>
and she need me, believe that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Javonte]</i><br/>
That girl is smoking<br/>
and can you believe that I'm her focus?<br/>
It ain't hard to see she got me open<br/>
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
What's up love? It's been a while<br/>
You been good? I've been around<br/>
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chiles<br/>
Truant like a student, you the principal<br/>
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining<br/>
like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond<br/>
I was Your Highness, you was my queen<br/>
You got over him when I got in between<br/>
Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S<br/>
for us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished<br/>
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together<br/>
Every time I put the head in you would panic<br/>
and come right down like an avalanche<br/>
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants<br/>
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir<br/>
Wake it back up, Folgers posters<br/>
By my waistline, shout for your hard hit<br/>
You called it a hate crime, say you want me back<br/>
and your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit<br/>
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[MURS]</i><br/>
I upped and walked out, now she crying cuz<br/>
She need me, I got that John Bryan love<br/>
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk<br/>
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch<br/>
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out<br/>
my heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out<br/>
There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?<br/>
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house<br/>
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon<br/>
Memories I got saved up like a coupon<br/>
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed<br/>
I was broke then, couldn't count the best weed<br/>
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback<br/>
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that<br/>
I would say yep, smiling so freely<br/>
That was back then, but I bet she still need me<br/>
She need me, she need me<br/>
She need me, she need me<br/>
I would say yes, smiling so freely<br/>
That was back then, I bet she still need me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
