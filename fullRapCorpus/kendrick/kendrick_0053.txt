<i>[Hook: Pharrell]</i><br/>
Mass hallucination baby<br/>
Ill education baby<br/>
Want to reconnect with your relations<br/>
This is your station baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals<br/>
Of a prisoner on his way<br/>
Trapped inside your desire<br/>
To fire bullets that stray<br/>
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away<br/>
I should ask a choir what do you require<br/>
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith<br/>
As the record spin I should pray<br/>
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey<br/>
I got ate alive yesterday<br/>
I got animosity building<br/>
It's probably big as a building<br/>
Me jumping off of the roof<br/>
Is just me playing it safe<br/>
But what am I supposed to do<br/>
When the topic is red or blue<br/>
And you understand that I ain't<br/>
But know I'm accustomed to<br/>
Just a couple that look for trouble<br/>
And live in the street with rank<br/>
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study<br/>
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face<br/>
From a function that tooken place<br/>
They was wondering if I bang<br/>
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks<br/>
I don't mind because one day you respect<br/>
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
All I see is strobe lights<br/>
Blinding me in my hindsight<br/>
Finding me by myself<br/>
Promise me you can help<br/>
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic<br/>
And finally made decision to hold me against my will<br/>
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still<br/>
I can never pick out the difference<br/>
? or cop on the bill<br/>
Every time you clock in the morning<br/>
I feel you just want to kill<br/>
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose<br/>
To persevere as a better person<br/>
I know you heard this and probably in fear<br/>
But what am I supposed to do<br/>
With the blinking of red and blue<br/>
Flash from the top of your roof<br/>
And your dog has to say proof<br/>
And you ask "lift up your shirt"<br/>
Cause you wonder if a tattoo<br/>
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through<br/>
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile<br/>
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"<br/>
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest<br/>
He don't mind, he know we never respect<br/>
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
All I see in this room<br/>
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms<br/>
Grown-up candy for pain<br/>
Can we live in the same society<br/>
It's entirely stressful upon my brain<br/>
You hired me as a victim<br/>
I quietly hope for change<br/>
When violence is the rhythm<br/>
Inspired me to obtain<br/>
The silence in this room<br/>
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms<br/>
Some grown-up candy I lost it<br/>
I feel it's nothing to lose<br/>
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best<br/>
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt<br/>
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city<br/>
<br/>
