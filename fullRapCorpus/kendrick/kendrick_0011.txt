<i>[Kendrick Lamar - singing]</i><br/>
A nigga so goddamn stressed out<br/>
I feel like fuck everything right now<br/>
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life<br/>
But I'll be damned if I give 'em a handout<br/>
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside<br/>
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye<br/>
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried<br/>
What? Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?<br/>
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you<br/>
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you<br/>
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?<br/>
Nobody, nobody but you<br/>
So it feels like, like it's only you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to<br/>
I want to, I want to go so far from here<br/>
Very, very far from here<br/>
I need to, I need to<br/>
I need to, I need to go so far from here<br/>
Very, very far from here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar - singing]</i><br/>
It seems like, you can't win for losing<br/>
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"<br/>
Sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come<br/>
Nobody knows the position that you in<br/>
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing<br/>
That feeling, hard to explain<br/>
When you just, just want to get away<br/>
Something like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
Away from it all<br/>
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit<br/>
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision<br/>
I'm stuck on the studio couch, now I'm thinking bout my daughter<br/>
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered<br/>
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order<br/>
instead of problem solving<br/>
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride<br/>
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes<br/>
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud<br/>
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread<br/>
as I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony<br/>
Nothing is surrounding me, living my life<br/>
Though it's better to write<br/>
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light<br/>
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real<br/>
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i>
