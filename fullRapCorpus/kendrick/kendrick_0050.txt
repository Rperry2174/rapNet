Everybody, everybody, everybody<br/>
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen<br/>
To this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans<br/>
Ya bish<br/>
<br/>
Smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye<br/>
Drank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye<br/>
Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now<br/>
And we ain't asking for no favors<br/>
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye<br/>
Really I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now<br/>
And momma used to say<br/>
One day, it's gon' burn you out<br/>
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out<br/>
One day, it's gon' burn you out<br/>
One day, it's gon' burn you<br/>
But I'm with the homies right now<br/>
<br/>
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota<br/>
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda<br/>
Janky stash box when the federales roll up<br/>
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor<br/>
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble<br/>
I hope the universe love you today<br/>
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away<br/>
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate<br/>
If it’s necessary<br/>
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted<br/>
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent<br/>
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it<br/>
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses<br/>
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls<br/>
And asked them what they working with – look at me<br/>
I got the blunt in my mouth<br/>
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit I’m with the homies<br/>
<br/>
(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red<br/>
Come through and bust ya head nigga)<br/>
Me and the homies<br/>
(Sag all the way to the liquor store<br/>
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)<br/>
Me and the homies<br/>
(I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas<br/>
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)<br/>
Me and the homies<br/>
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like<br/>
“Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!”)<br/>
<br/>
It’s 2:30 and the sun is beaming<br/>
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming<br/>
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me<br/>
I’ll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating<br/>
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester<br/>
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord<br/>
They knew we weren’t from ‘round there<br/>
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile SIM cards<br/>
Bougie bitches with no extensions<br/>
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination<br/>
Before we sparked a conversation<br/>
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like then started interrogating<br/>
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither<br/>
I really doubt it<br/>
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it<br/>
That’s ironic ‘cause I’ve never been violent, until I’m with the homies<br/>
<br/>
(Just ridin’, just ridin’)<br/>
Me and the homies<br/>
(Bullshittin’, actin’ a fool)<br/>
Me and the homies<br/>
(Trippin’, really trippin’)<br/>
Me and the homies<br/>
(Just ridin’, just ridin’, just ridin’...)<br/>
<br/>
Bragging ‘bout the episode we just had<br/>
A shot of Hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad<br/>
I’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma<br/>
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you<br/>
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience<br/>
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in<br/>
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still “nigga, what is you saying”<br/>
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months<br/>
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want<br/>
(Ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe<br/>
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room<br/>
Wait, what?<br/>
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)<br/>
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo<br/>
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk<br/>
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right<br/>
Then made a left, we was just circling life<br/>
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'?" “Kicking it”<br/>
I should’ve told her I’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies<br/>
<br/>
But they made a right, they made a left then made a right<br/>
Then another right<br/>
One lucky night with the homies<br/>
<br/>
K. Dot, you faded, hood?<br/>
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though<br/>
Ooh, which one?<br/>
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it<br/>
I pray he ain't hit that<br/>
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one<br/>
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans<br/>
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe Nigga, for what?<br/>
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?<br/>
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"<br/>
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street<br/>
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go<br/>
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi.<br/>
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park,<br/>
cause I know he trying to fuck on Sherane tonight<br/>
That's what he’s not gon' do. Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30<br/>
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too<br/>
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight<br/>
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active
