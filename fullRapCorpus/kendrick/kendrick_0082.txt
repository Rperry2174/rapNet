Come here, girl<br/>
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?<br/>
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair<br/>
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now<br/>
Like that? I got you baby<br/>
All on you baby<br/>
Push it back on daddy<br/>
Push it back on daddy baby<br/>
<br/>
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is…<br/>
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory<br/>
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling<br/>
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking<br/>
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution<br/>
In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this<br/>
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling<br/>
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman<br/>
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction<br/>
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable<br/>
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid<br/>
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys<br/>
Valleys and high places turn into dust<br/>
Famous screaming in agony<br/>
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky<br/>
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling “he’s alive”<br/>
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness<br/>
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes<br/>
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out<br/>
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out<br/>
Public bathroom, college classroom’s been deserted<br/>
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it<br/>
(It’s happening) no more running from world wars<br/>
(It’s happening) no more discriminating the poor<br/>
(It’s happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas<br/>
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure<br/>
I swore I seen it vividly<br/>
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony<br/>
Thunder like number four, then I heard<br/>
“What have you did for me”<br/>
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume<br/>
That dated back to June 17th, 1987<br/>
My paperwork was like a receipt<br/>
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment<br/>
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors<br/>
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever<br/>
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home<br/>
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell<br/>
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel<br/>
I made To Pimp a Butterfly ‘fore you told me<br/>
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you<br/>
Say I didn’t try for you, say I didn’t ride for you<br/>
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you<br/>
Who love you like I love you?<br/>
Crucifix, tell me you can fix<br/>
Anytime I need, I’mma start jotting everything in my diary<br/>
Never would you lie to me<br/>
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered<br/>
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet<br/>
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse<br/>
I guess I’m running in place trying to make it to church<br/>
<br/>
Young nigga act an ass<br/>
Young nigga act a fool<br/>
Young nigga get yo’ cash<br/>
Young nigga do what it do<br/>
Young nigga go, young nigga go<br/>
Young nigga go, young nigga go<br/>
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch<br/>
Just take it all back before the light switch
