<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Lord God<br/>
I come to you a sinner<br/>
And I humbly repent for my sins<br/>
I believe that Jesus is Lord<br/>
I believe that you raised him from the dead<br/>
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life<br/>
And be my Lord and Savior<br/>
I receive Jesus to take control of my life<br/>
And that I may live for him from this day forth<br/>
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood<br/>
In Jesus name, Amen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central <br/>
she had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta<br/>
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel<br/>
I want to ride like Arabians<br/>
Push an '04 Mercedes-Benz<br/>
"Hello my name is Kendrick"<br/>
She said "No, you're handsome"<br/>
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing<br/>
Ciara had played in the background<br/>
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (cool)<br/>
"Where you stay?"<br/>
She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"<br/>
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount<br/>
"Well is it Compton?"<br/>
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and<br/>
Strictly had one of her thighs around me<br/>
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental<br/>
My motive was rather sinful<br/>
"What you trying to get into?"<br/>
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel<br/>
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
The summer had passed and now I'm liking her<br/>
Conversation we having probably enticing her<br/>
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her<br/>
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us<br/>
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb<br/>
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from<br/>
We know a lot bout each other, her mother was a crack addict<br/>
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers<br/>
Her favorite cousin Demetrius has a reputable<br/>
History of gang banging did make me skeptical<br/>
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut<br/>
I wanna come over, what's up?<br/>
That's what I told her soon as this episode<br/>
Of Martin go off<br/>
I'm trying to get off<br/>
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty<br/>
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart<br/>
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a caravan<br/>
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump<br/>
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam<br/>
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man<br/>
I'm thinking bout that sex, <br/>
thinking bout her thighs or maybe kissing on her neck, <br/>
or maybe what positions next<br/>
Sent her pictures of her titties blowing up my texts<br/>
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette<br/>
Enthused by the touch of a woman she's a masseuse<br/>
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose<br/>
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom<br/>
I', hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem<br/>
I'm two blocks away 250 feet and six steps from where she stay<br/>
She waving me 'cross the street<br/>
I pulled up a smile on my face<br/>
And then I see<br/>
Two niggas, two black hoodies<br/>
I froze as my phone rang<br/>
<br/>
