Lord forgive me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand<br/>
Then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block<br/>
And blam I ain't backing down for nothing<br/>
I'm a back em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand<br/>
Better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man<br/>
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner,<br/>
Coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,<br/>
The next morning high toasted up with my homies<br/>
We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh<br/>
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton<br/>
Ask me what I have accomplished<br/>
I don't know I don't have conscience<br/>
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting<br/>
No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something<br/>
Protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion<br/>
Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics<br/>
Cause ignorance is bliss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far<br/>
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off<br/>
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off<br/>
Until the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off<br/>
Then peel off, in a hooptie<br/>
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me<br/>
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me<br/>
Indubitably I'm too street<br/>
Indubitably I'm a do me<br/>
Better than your bitch would<br/>
But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks<br/>
And I'm good<br/>
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm<br/>
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent<br/>
No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish<br/>
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet<br/>
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic<br/>
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic<br/>
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged<br/>
Die young, corpse identified by your parents<br/>
Apparently you a parrot<br/>
Mocking me and my blueprint<br/>
But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff<br/>
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments<br/>
The critics are calling me conscious<br/>
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton<br/>
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?<br/>
Proves, that ignorance is bliss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far<br/>
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off<br/>
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball<br/>
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard<br/>
I'm so-Cal, you so called<br/>
Rappers need to go call<br/>
Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off<br/>
I show up, to show out to show off<br/>
You a hundred percent behind me<br/>
And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene<br/>
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me<br/>
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me<br/>
Backin' down boggins<br/>
Backin' down bitches<br/>
We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin<br/>
You gon' tip her<br/>
Cause ignorance is bliss<br/>
And Willy B I'm a fool on yo beats, I bleed out the speaker<br/>
As the speaker that spoke when they done speak
