<i>[female]</i><br/>
I used to want to be like Michael Jordan<br/>
Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Uh, every time I'm in my city I be hacking like my shit don't stink<br/>
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink<br/>
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair<br/>
Bumping "Me Against the World", hello world, Kendrick here<br/>
And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes<br/>
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes<br/>
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes<br/>
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes<br/>
Michael Jordan<br/>
Bounce-bounce hoe, bounce-bounce<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head<br/>
or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich<br/>
Pull up on them twenty-sixes, I'm a vanity slave<br/>
I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways<br/>
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me<br/>
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see<br/>
I'm a Comp-town representer, concrete backflipper<br/>
A.K.A. that nigga, don't worry<br/>
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me<br/>
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see<br/>
This is HiiiPoWeR, since the Eddie Bower I've been popular<br/>
I'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come<br/>
You jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping though?<br/>
We stopping the traffic, what you know bout them hockey pucks?<br/>
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em<br/>
See too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming<br/>
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me<br/>
and I don't know why... "Hey, wait a minute motherfucker"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Every time I'm in my city I be feeling like my shit don't stink<br/>
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink<br/>
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair<br/>
Bumping "Me Against the World", hello world, Kendrick here<br/>
And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes<br/>
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes<br/>
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes<br/>
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes<br/>
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch<br/>
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch<br/>
That means I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes<br/>
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?<br/>
Only thing I did wrong was make it possible<br/>
I diddy bop and make them titties pop<br/>
Out there on my bumper like a city cop<br/>
Walking down to Fred Segal, put my girl on it<br/>
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it<br/>
Ay, pussy crazy, pussy crazy<br/>
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy<br/>
Man, I know I can't tell you bout the world homie<br/>
But I know I can tell you bout your girl homie<br/>
Her pussy's crazy, her pussy crazy<br/>
I fucked nigga, I know you hate me<br/>
I know they pay me, too much of attention<br/>
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned<br/>
I need me an engine that go real fast<br/>
Call it "Haul of Fame", once it haul ass<br/>
Give me tall glass, Coconut Ciroc<br/>
Please no soda pop, I make my solo pop<br/>
Life's a bitch, her pussy crazy<br/>
But I make that pussy pay me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
I remember tripping, walking through the set like my Glock don't think<br/>
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink<br/>
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me<br/>
and I don't why you sucker niggas can't see<br/>
I'm from Hoover mayne, high as Supermayne, shit you Lois Lane<br/>
You pussy mayne with the pussy game, shit we off the chain<br/>
We popping ay, fortune, not the fame, shit you backwards mayne<br/>
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes<br/>
Your broad that chose, yes she moving on, yep we do it wrong<br/>
We fuck the homes, fuck the center home, marijuana strong<br/>
You know I'm gone, turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?<br/>
My paper long, yep you left alone, you gets none fucks<br/>
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round<br/>
Told Mary/merry was a (go), so we passed her (round) and (round)<br/>
Your bitch texted me, wants it now, so I had to knock her down<br/>
Work her bouncing on my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth<br/>
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I'm done<br/>
I can be her number two and you can be her number one<br/>
Her pussy's crazy, her pussy's crazy<br/>
You fuck niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i>
