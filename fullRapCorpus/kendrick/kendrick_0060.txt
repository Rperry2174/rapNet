<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."<br/>
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."<br/>
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."<br/>
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."<br/>
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."<br/>
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets<br/>
Making my conscious ask me<br/>
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"<br/>
Black boy fly<br/>
Black boy fly<br/>
Black-black boy fly<br/>
Black boy fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo<br/>
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo<br/>
He was the one to follow<br/>
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows<br/>
He would live in the gym<br/>
We was living in sorrow<br/>
Total envy of him<br/>
He made a dream become a reality<br/>
Actually making it possible to swim<br/>
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish<br/>
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars<br/>
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30<br/>
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me<br/>
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder<br/>
That we was just moving backwards<br/>
The bungalow where you find us<br/>
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast<br/>
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math<br/>
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom<br/>
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have<br/>
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals<br/>
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile<br/>
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl<br/>
11 graders gone wrong<br/>
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron<br/>
Now watch that black boy fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Black boy fly<br/>
Watch that black boy fly<br/>
Black boy fly<br/>
Watch that black boy fly<br/>
Black boy fly<br/>
Watch that black boy fly<br/>
Black boy...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I used to jealous of Jayceon<br/>
I used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young<br/>
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs<br/>
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn<br/>
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against<br/>
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm<br/>
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed<br/>
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn<br/>
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar<br/>
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store<br/>
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait<br/>
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes<br/>
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities<br/>
Chillin my conscience next to a villain<br/>
Compton made you believe success wasn't real<br/>
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal<br/>
So as I peel through these lottery tickets<br/>
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped<br/>
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top<br/>
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block<br/>
So watch that black boy fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted<br/>
Like most of the winners call it<br/>
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching<br/>
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan<br/>
A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording<br/>
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype<br/>
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40<br/>
And shortly, I got discouraged<br/>
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting<br/>
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase<br/>
Only one in a million will ever see better days<br/>
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis<br/>
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy<br/>
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me<br/>
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me<br/>
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle<br/>
When 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical<br/>
3 niggas making it out, that's mission impossible<br/>
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do<br/>
I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got<br/>
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...<br/>
Out of Compton<br/>
<br/>
Thank God...<br/>
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
