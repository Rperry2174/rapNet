<i>[Intro: Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Playas always trying to pop bottles<br/>
Niggas love to pop bottles<br/>
Then get you a table, my nigga, get you a table, my nigga...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank<br/>
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank<br/>
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank<br/>
Faded, drank, faded, drank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up<br/>
When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up<br/>
Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets<br/>
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?<br/>
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober<br/>
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis<br/>
One life, that's all we have, OK lets toast to that<br/>
Then dive in a pool full of liquor, swim laps like Michael Phelps<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?<br/>
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch<br/>
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br/>
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br/>
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock<br/>
All the girls wanna play Baywatch<br/>
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it<br/>
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize<br/>
Hope this dollar shot of E&amp;J will take the pain away<br/>
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose<br/>
With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken<br/>
You with it? (Soul!) Spread your wings, you probably won't get far<br/>
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car<br/>
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya<br/>
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
So it's that groovy little nigga known for popping them bottles<br/>
Under my pants be a golden dick, bitch, everything about me solid<br/>
Burberry nigga, them be my draws, Alexander McQueen in closets<br/>
Swagged-out king, yeah nigga I'm Puff, uh, have that pussy throbbin'<br/>
Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that, twisted off them molly caps<br/>
Ciroc too don't fuck wit Goose; can I get a shot, swim in your juice?<br/>
Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat<br/>
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet - bitch, did you see your tab reciept?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
“Sherane?”<br/>
(Pool full of liqour then you dive in, in, in, in <i>[reversed]</i>)<br/>
“Sherane, Sherane, Sherane” (Wa-Watch em all f-flock)<br/>
"Awww man"<br/>
“Sherane” (Girls wanna play, play, play)<br/>
Where is she taking me? (P-Pool full of liquor imma d-d-i-iive in)<br/>
Where is she, taking… me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
All I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure<br/>
And I got hunger pain that grow insane; tell me do that sound familiar?<br/>
If it do then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief<br/>
Is in the bottom of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf<br/>
As the window open I release, everything that corrode inside of me<br/>
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep<br/>
And never ever wake up; never ever wake up, never ever wake up<br/>
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
More, more, bless me more<br/>
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more<br/>
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more<br/>
Fill it up more, not enough, moooore<br/>
...Bless me more<br/>
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more<br/>
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more<br/>
Fill it up more, not enough, more <i>[3X]</i>
