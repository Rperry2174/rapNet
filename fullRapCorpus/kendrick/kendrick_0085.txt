<i>[SZA (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth<br/>
(Tell ’em when you went to the park and everybody came back and…)<br/>
And welfare don’t mean well for you, you, you, you<br/>
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you…)<br/>
They tell me that my bill’s past due, due, due, due<br/>
(Talk about the charge you got…)<br/>
And preacher man don’t always tell the truth, truth, truth<br/>
(Do you believe in God? If you don’t, it’s cool)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SZA &amp; Jay Rock (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
(But) head is the answer, head is the future<br/>
Don’t second guess yourself<br/>
(Don’t tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot…)<br/>
Come on give me some help, yeah<br/>
Head is the answer, head is the future<br/>
Don’t second guess yourself<br/>
Come on, give me some help<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lance Skiiiwalker:]</i><br/>
And I just wanna<br/>
And I just wanna<br/>
Straight up<br/>
Eyes with my head<br/>
And I can’t use some help<br/>
Straight up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br/>
Head is the future
