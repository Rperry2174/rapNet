<i>[Sample: Twin Sister - "Meet The Frownies"]</i><br/>
Smoking weed with you...<br/>
Cause you taught me into...<br/>
<i>[Repeats]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr Dre:]</i><br/>
Every morning when I wake up<br/>
Uh, money on my mind<br/>
Good times and get caked up<br/>
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I'm living but<br/>
Really though, it's never enough<br/>
10 million, that's a must<br/>
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Women, weed and weather<br/>
They come for<br/>
Women, weed and weather<br/>
For the women, weed and weather<br/>
From all around the world for the<br/>
Women, weed and weather<br/>
Women, weed and weather<br/>
<br/>
These niggas'll kill for that<br/>
Put it in your grill for that<br/>
Still everybody gotta build for that<br/>
Me, I make mills off that<br/>
How the fuck ya'll can't see I ride<br/>
When I drive, down the block and you look outside<br/>
H-A-T-E in your eyes<br/>
I enter big money for the enterprise<br/>
It's a beautiful day I guess<br/>
For a bitch to roll with Andre I guess<br/>
Roll it up, baby gonna lift that dress<br/>
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss<br/>
New Orleans and then Miami<br/>
Party in New York<br/>
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'<br/>
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Women, weed and weather<br/>
They come for<br/>
Women, weed and weather<br/>
For the women, weed and weather<br/>
From all around the world for the<br/>
Women, weed and weather<br/>
Got that women, weed and weather<br/>
Yo, it sound clever, come and play<br/>
Wha-Wha-what more can I say<br/>
Welcome to LA<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some<br/>
3W's only for a three day run<br/>
Bitch, take the motherfacking panties off you ain't no nun, shit<br/>
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes<br/>
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control<br/>
Let it breath<br/>
I control, California living til I am old<br/>
You want to be one, to peak on the chart<br/>
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts<br/>
She in the coupe cause she in the neon<br/>
Cause she on the BS before we can start<br/>
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga<br/>
Let 'em know the priority order me<br/>
Hennessy, and for my niggas OG Killa<br/>
Call it Jason Vorhees, boy he,<br/>
On his job, boy he sure be havin' them marks on they marks<br/>
Pretty bitches and tyre marks<br/>
Let 'em inhale the pipe exhausts<br/>
Let 'em reveal how much it cost<br/>
For this life controlling my price<br/>
No way hell no, uh uh<br/>
If I'm wrong than I wanna be right<br/>
You want to be one, to peak on the chart<br/>
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts<br/>
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault that it's 82 degrees<br/>
And my top peeled off<br/>
<br/>
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss<br/>
New Orleans and then Miami<br/>
Party in New York<br/>
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'<br/>
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr Dre:]</i><br/>
Known for that homegrown where I come from<br/>
Smoke one, palm trees<br/>
Double D's got 'em topless in the sun<br/>
I shall proceed, that's me, motherfuck your opinion<br/>
How many ways am I killin' 'em<br/>
Shit, right around a billion<br/>
We on it, that mean we living for the moment<br/>
That mean she'll fuck til the morning<br/>
Time and I got time and I know that I'm in a position of controlling anything<br/>
I buy that ocean, I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean<br/>
Ain't nobody fucking with this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
They want that shit, they often fiend<br/>
I give it to 'em but in between, my time<br/>
I gotta tie shoestrings<br/>
Life's a trip when you want these things<br/>
I often slip and then I lean towards 3 W's and life<br/>
You know blow job need an application<br/>
Eating pussy make appetite<br/>
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown<br/>
Just like my drink, the fuck you think<br/>
I don't fuck with' no hand me downs<br/>
See if you fuck than it's after me<br/>
You know how much I'm a make it work?<br/>
You know her dress, living in her purse<br/>
When you discussed your love for lust<br/>
Just make sure you visit here first<br/>
Cali<br/>
<br/>
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss<br/>
New Orleans and then Miami<br/>
Party in New York<br/>
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'<br/>
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living<br/>
<br/>
