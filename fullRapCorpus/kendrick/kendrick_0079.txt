Study long, study wrong, nigga<br/>
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker<br/>
Close that door!<br/>
My OG up in this motherfucker right now<br/>
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool<br/>
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like:<br/>
<br/>
I could spot you a mile away<br/>
I could see your insecurities written all on your face<br/>
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say<br/>
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang<br/>
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same<br/>
Circus acts only attract those that entertain<br/>
Small talk, we know that it's all talk<br/>
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me<br/>
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me<br/>
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me<br/>
It's all in your head, homie<br/>
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me<br/>
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me<br/>
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me<br/>
You sound like the feds, homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br/>
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie<br/>
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga<br/>
You ain't gotta try so hard<br/>
<br/>
And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you<br/>
But you think it's all love<br/>
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done<br/>
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one<br/>
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)<br/>
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)<br/>
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex<br/>
Let me put it back in proper context<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
What do you got to offer?<br/>
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin<br/>
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit<br/>
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is<br/>
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie<br/>
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts<br/>
You can never persuade me<br/>
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them<br/>
Or you, the truth you love to bend<br/>
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho<br/>
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though<br/>
So loud, rich niggas got low money<br/>
And loud, broke niggas got no money<br/>
The irony behind it is so funny<br/>
And I seen it all this past year<br/>
Pass on some advice we feel:<br/>
<br/>
