<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
"Gina, baby, I don't have no money, and I don't have no ends<br/>
Gina, I'm ass-out" <i>[laughter]</i><br/>
"I'm going through something right now"<br/>
"I told you that"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?<br/>
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?<br/>
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?<br/>
Well alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
I'm going through something with life<br/>
where pussy and Patron make you feel alright<br/>
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright<br/>
Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs<br/>
Something to inspire me, rather than society's<br/>
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love<br/>
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club<br/>
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05<br/>
That bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, I had no job<br/>
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans<br/>
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did<br/>
Guilty by association, story of my life nigga!<br/>
You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga!<br/>
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers<br/>
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover<br/>
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin<br/>
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream<br/>
So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it<br/>
Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry ("hey what's up daddy?")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[beat switches up]</i><br/>
<br/>
"So what you wish me over here for?<br/>
How was your day?<br/>
Are you tipsy?"<br/>
Mhmm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals]</i><br/>
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron<br/>
Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on<br/>
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw<br/>
Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do<br/>
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is<br/>
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives<br/>
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready<br/>
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me<br/>
When you let me, when you let me...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar - singing]</i><br/>
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty<br/>
That good shit stuff<br/>
I can't get enough<br/>
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe<br/>
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty<br/>
That good shit stuff<br/>
I can't get enough<br/>
If I offend you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home<br/>
and caught that flat in the <i>[?]</i> flats<br/>
And it made me think when another car blinked<br/>
to change locations where we at<br/>
We often get lost in the ever-hard bottle<br/>
when attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow<br/>
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit<br/>
Your car now due and you bout to get evicted<br/>
Two drugs surely, Patron, pussy, make it feel alright<br/>
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life<br/>
You can't run from it, gotta run to it nigga<br/>
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga<br/>
But still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?<br/>
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram<br/>
Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them<br/>
One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me<br/>
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man<br/>
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it<br/>
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open<br/>
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open<br/>
'Soul, balls deep, ya dig?<br/>
Retrieve relief, ya dig?<br/>
Let's kill a bottle of tequila<br/>
and lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?<br/>
What's up? I had a long day and I really want to fuck<br/>
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day<br/>
cause all I've been thinking the whole day...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals]</i><br/>
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron<br/>
Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on<br/>
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw<br/>
Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do<br/>
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is<br/>
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives<br/>
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready<br/>
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me<br/>
When you let me, when you let me...
