Alls my life I has to fight, nigga<br/>
Alls my life I...<br/>
Hard times like yah<br/>
Bad trips like "God!"<br/>
Nazareth, I'm fucked up<br/>
Homie you fucked up<br/>
But if God got us then we gon' be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Pharrell Williams:]</i><br/>
Nigga, we gon' be alright<br/>
Nigga, we gon' be alright<br/>
We gon' be alright<br/>
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br/>
Nigga, we gon' be alright<br/>
Huh? We gon' be alright<br/>
Nigga, we gon' be alright<br/>
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br/>
<br/>
Uh, and when I wake up<br/>
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut<br/>
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down<br/>
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down<br/>
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life<br/>
Painkillers only put me in the twilight<br/>
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight<br/>
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like<br/>
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy<br/>
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow<br/>
So my karma coming heavy<br/>
No preliminary hearings on my record<br/>
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record<br/>
Tell the world I know it's too late<br/>
Boys and girls I think I've gone cray<br/>
Drown inside my vices all day<br/>
Won't you please believe when I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-hook:]</i><br/>
When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga<br/>
When our pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"<br/>
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga<br/>
I'm at the preacher's door<br/>
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
What you want, you a house you a car<br/>
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar<br/>
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog<br/>
Motherfucker you can live at the mall<br/>
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know it's illegal<br/>
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero<br/>
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal<br/>
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you<br/>
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you<br/>
In the presence of your chico... ah!<br/>
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool<br/>
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you<br/>
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all<br/>
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all<br/>
I rap, I'm black, on track so rest assured<br/>
My rights, my wrongs I write till I'm right with God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I keep my head up high<br/>
I cross my heart and hope to die<br/>
Lovin' me is complicated<br/>
Too afraid, a lot of changes<br/>
I'm alright and you're a favorite<br/>
Dark nights in my prayers<br/>
<br/>
I remembered you was conflicted<br/>
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same<br/>
Abusing my power full of resentment<br/>
Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br/>
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room<br/>
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me<br/>
So I went runnin' for answers
