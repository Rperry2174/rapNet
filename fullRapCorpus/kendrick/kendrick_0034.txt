<i>[Chorus: Colin Munroe]</i><br/>
I love the way you, put it on your eyes<br/>
The roses on your face light up the sky<br/>
Those lips are colorful, all of the time, time, time<br/>
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind?<br/>
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day<br/>
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day (today)<br/>
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day<br/>
No makeup today<br/>
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind-mind-mind-mind?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
I know she bout to ask me how she look<br/>
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took<br/>
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'<br/>
She resembled a model out of a MAC book<br/>
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens<br/>
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision<br/>
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone<br/>
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown<br/>
Damn girl, why so much?<br/>
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up<br/>
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing<br/>
From Heaven is where you got it from<br/>
I love your smile, you can do it without style<br/>
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows<br/>
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur<br/>
I don't see it, all I see is a blur<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[Kendrick Lamar (female)]</i><br/>
I know she bout to ask me how she look<br/>
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took<br/>
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'<br/>
She resembled a model out of a MAC book<br/>
(Concentrating on the way my) eyeliner thickens<br/>
(He stand behind me and try to) figure her vision<br/>
(of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone<br/>
My complexion in a direction) I've outgrown<br/>
(I feel like it's not enough<br/>
I can never put on too much makeup<br/>
Yeah I know) your imperfections (I be constantly stressing<br/>
From him is where I get it from)<br/>
They tell me I need to) smile (at least once in a while<br/>
I hate my lips, my nose, my) eyebrows<br/>
(It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see<br/>
is that I had a black eye) <i>[beep]</i><br/>
To be continued, eleven<br/>
<br/>
"Ladies and gentlemen"<br/>
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun<br/>
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun<br/>
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun<br/>
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
