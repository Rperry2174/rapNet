<i>[Intro: Napoleon Hill]</i><br/>
"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible<br/>
because it will reveal to you why it is true<br/>
that whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve<br/>
regardless of how many times you have failed in the past<br/>
or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Go getter, with no cheddar<br/>
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater<br/>
My life is likely to see great endeavors<br/>
But I can't win if I can't get it together<br/>
What I gotta do in order to see success?<br/>
Having the world's best to call me the best<br/>
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed<br/>
with an address next to a beautiful actress<br/>
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole<br/>
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes<br/>
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition<br/>
But the last I checked, y'all was broke bitches<br/>
Make a name for myself<br/>
then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt<br/>
The homies on the block can say whatever they say<br/>
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ash Riser]</i><br/>
Take your time, it'll come<br/>
Just stay focussed and humble my son<br/>
Show and prove, prove you're the one<br/>
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most<br/>
So just go out and get it<br/>
Go out and get it<br/>
Go out and get it<br/>
Go out and get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
What I gotta do in order to see success?<br/>
Having the world's best to call me the best<br/>
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed<br/>
with an address next to a beautiful actress<br/>
Do I gotta run in your spot and blasting?<br/>
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing<br/>
Hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging<br/>
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon<br/>
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose<br/>
Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay<br/>
Area, or carry the birds to the gate<br/>
Let the clips distribute the work all day<br/>
Then come back home<br/>
Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones<br/>
Homies on the block can say whatever they want<br/>
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump<br/>
Donald that is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]</i><br/>
And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back<br/>
When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back<br/>
Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out<br/>
I gotta grind, grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
So welcome to the story of my life<br/>
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write<br/>
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife<br/>
Pop's engine in this old school run tight!<br/>
But as you listening to K. D-O-T<br/>
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC<br/>
She listening to Drake and all I can say<br/>
Damn, these niggas that much better than me?<br/>
Baby, I don't think this is meant to be<br/>
cause I'm always losing self-esteem<br/>
She paused the iPhone, then said huh<br/>
I repeated what I said, then she replied shut up<br/>
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it<br/>
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it<br/>
And never listen to what the industry say<br/>
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay<br/>
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones<br/>
Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid<br/>
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah<br/>
So I gotta see success<br/>
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps<br/>
Rising to the top like a soda shook up<br/>
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man<br/>
I wanna live good<br/>
Just wanna make my momma proud, y'know?<br/>
I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes<br/>
I got lil' brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga<br/>
I just want it, I just want it<br/>
and I'ma get it
