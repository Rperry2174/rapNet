His eyes bloodshot red<br/>
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother<br/>
Reminiscing on them playing Sega with each other<br/>
He was hurting, I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex<br/>
I stood by his side because that was my homie<br/>
Gave him a hug, some of his brother blood got on me<br/>
Clenching his fists on some angry shit<br/>
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hanging with<br/>
I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer<br/>
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war<br/>
Revenge, what do say to a good friend<br/>
that just lost it and grabbing choppers out the closet?<br/>
I tried my best to make him renege, but he was like my nig'<br/>
This feeling is more than personal<br/>
I stood down, he hopped in a hour-door Honda Accord<br/>
Before he bent the block he said K. Dot, you wouldn't understand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes<br/>
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace<br/>
Can someone just pray for me, or war<br/>
(Or at least, try to understand) the city pressure<br/>
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s<br/>
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith &amp; Wessons<br/>
Pray for me, or war<br/>
<br/>
Corners become monuments for the dead<br/>
Candles on the pavement, postcard read<br/>
rest in peace, the yellow tape blocking off the streets<br/>
A baby momma yelling at the police<br/>
But you don't understand, you figure that we're just a bunch of niggas<br/>
But the picture is a story untold<br/>
See this wasn't in our plans<br/>
Babies from the late eighties wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way<br/>
Put that Malcolm X book down, then raised that K<br/>
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides<br/>
Look the Devil in the face from a saint eye<br/>
Cast a 'spell' on you like Akeelah and the Bee<br/>
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted, mind<br/>
Substance, time is no longer an issue<br/>
We don't have it, so pass the tissue<br/>
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can<br/>
Then tell her you understand, but you don't understand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes<br/>
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace<br/>
Can someone just pray for me, or war<br/>
(And hopefully you'll understand) the city pressure<br/>
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s<br/>
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith &amp; Wessons<br/>
Pray for me, or war<br/>
<br/>
He came back fifteen minutes later<br/>
He said, Dot I went on one, do me this favor<br/>
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you<br/>
This is critical as it gets my nigga, I need you<br/>
I said alright, so what happened? Seen a few niggas slipping<br/>
and I just started clapping, I didn't care who I was hitting<br/>
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you<br/>
I love you my nigga, make sure you hit me up by tomorrow<br/>
I woke up the next morning with a cold<br/>
Allergies got me sneezing and wiping my nose when it was leaking<br/>
Checked the medicine cabinet, looking for some DayQuil<br/>
But all I seem was some aspirins, just my luck<br/>
I got up, went to Rite Aid<br/>
Hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid, I bought it and left<br/>
Walked to the parking lot, that's when I seen the faces of death<br/>
Said they was looking for my man with a chopper in their hand<br/>
Praying that it would jam, but you don't understand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes<br/>
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace<br/>
Can someone just pray for me, or war<br/>
(Now tell me, do you understand?) the city pressure<br/>
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s (huh?)<br/>
The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith &amp; Wessons (do you understand?)<br/>
Pray for me, or war<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
It's like, it's a revolving door<br/>
that I've been a part of my whole life<br/>
Fucked up right?
