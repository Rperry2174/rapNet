<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Reporting live, from Compton, California<br/>
North Cackalack<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix<br/>
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting<br/>
My itinerary is very hectic<br/>
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless<br/>
Kendrick Lamar, know how to maul with my wrist<br/>
Shout to writers for holding it down bitch<br/>
Me and my down bitch, get busy<br/>
I'm busy taking over, the world<br/>
with the weight of the world on my shoulder<br/>
My drive is not to be chauffeured<br/>
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist<br/>
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper<br/>
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target<br/>
with offers that got me up in these offices often<br/>
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying<br/>
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times<br/>
The good kid from the mad city<br/>
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock<br/>
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops<br/>
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride<br/>
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down<br/>
like Stacie homie when airing out endo<br/>
I wish a nigga would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop<br/>
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop<br/>
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop<br/>
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock<br/>
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop<br/>
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop<br/>
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop<br/>
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapper Big Pooh]</i><br/>
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite<br/>
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it<br/>
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired<br/>
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired<br/>
Now I'm brushing off the dust<br/>
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust<br/>
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk<br/>
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus<br/>
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing<br/>
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between<br/>
The new regime taking over<br/>
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier<br/>
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it<br/>
off to the next, you unlucky bastard<br/>
I'm getting drunk same time every year<br/>
to celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here<br/>
I swear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo<br/>
Even zoos can beat up from punchlines<br/>
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet<br/>
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet<br/>
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the<br/>
city like a District Attorney being the case for killers<br/>
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter<br/>
since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapper Big Pooh]</i><br/>
U-P-S, I (deliver)<br/>
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter<br/>
No glitter, all guts, no glory<br/>
Station on repeat, they retread the same story<br/>
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit<br/>
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip<br/>
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-<br/>
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
