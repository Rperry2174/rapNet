<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Smoke good, eat good, live good <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary<br/>
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me<br/>
Since my uncles was institutionalised<br/>
my intuition has said I was suited for family ties<br/>
My mama is stressing, my daddy tired<br/>
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride<br/>
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried<br/>
to save me, how I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?<br/>
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts<br/>
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink<br/>
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga<br/>
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya<br/>
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun<br/>
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie<br/>
Stand for something or fall for anything<br/>
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink<br/>
But anyway, this for my niggas<br/>
Uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures<br/>
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow<br/>
that you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row<br/>
You came home to a pocket full of stones<br/>
A MetroPC' phone, then you went back in<br/>
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view<br/>
I'ma get it right just so you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Smoke good, eat good, live good <i>[5X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[GLC]</i><br/>
And I do this for the city<br/>
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me<br/>
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me<br/>
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga<br/>
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya<br/>
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya<br/>
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya<br/>
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial<br/>
Not rich but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me<br/>
My killings are not remorseful, the city got my back<br/>
Before that, I give them my torso<br/>
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical<br/>
cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual<br/>
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve<br/>
My simplest shit be more pivotal<br/>
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals<br/>
Worry some individuals that live life critical<br/>
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet<br/>
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me<br/>
But anyway, this for my pops<br/>
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot<br/>
On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves<br/>
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved<br/>
Somebody said my name on the radio, he ain't know<br/>
I was ready for the world that minute<br/>
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it, he'll probably be<br/>
out of work, laid back, while he<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Smoke good, eat good, live good <i>[5X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[GLC]</i><br/>
And I do this for the city<br/>
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me<br/>
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me<br/>
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: GLC]</i><br/>
Church is definitely on the move, and now that we took it up to the cathedral<br/>
cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking bout?<br/>
We out here rotating under the five Ps<br/>
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, you know what I'm talking bout?<br/>
Doing my thing, cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping<br/>
from the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton<br/>
Know what I'm talking bout? Church is definitely on the move<br/>
and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far<br/>
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar<br/>
You know what I'm talking bout?<br/>
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking bout?<br/>
You gotta get up off your ass and get it man<br/>
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand<br/>
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking bout?<br/>
Apply yourself to supply your wealth<br/>
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself<br/>
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking bout?<br/>
Exercise your ism and don't depend on no one else<br/>
Cathedral, chuuch! Ism
