Everything black, I don't want black<br/>
I want everything black, I ain't need black<br/>
Some white some black, I ain't mean black<br/>
I want everything black<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Six in the mornin', fire in the street<br/>
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see<br/>
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain<br/>
It's such a shame they may call me crazy<br/>
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'<br/>
But homie you made me<br/>
Black don't crack my nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015<br/>
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean<br/>
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses<br/>
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it<br/>
I'm African-American, I'm African<br/>
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village<br/>
Pardon my residence<br/>
Came from the bottom of mankind<br/>
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide<br/>
You hate me don't you?<br/>
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture<br/>
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey<br/>
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me<br/>
And this is more than confession<br/>
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion<br/>
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it<br/>
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'<br/>
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br/>
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br/>
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice<br/>
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black<br/>
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black<br/>
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black<br/>
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks<br/>
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back<br/>
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block<br/>
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black<br/>
Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that<br/>
<br/>
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015<br/>
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean<br/>
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society<br/>
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me<br/>
Curse me till I'm dead<br/>
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head<br/>
Institutionalize manipulation and lies<br/>
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes<br/>
You hate me don't you?<br/>
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself<br/>
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt<br/>
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out<br/>
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah<br/>
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special<br/>
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?<br/>
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?<br/>
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015<br/>
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree<br/>
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred<br/>
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification<br/>
I'm African-American, I'm African<br/>
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan<br/>
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius<br/>
Excuse my French but fuck you â€” no, fuck y'all<br/>
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?<br/>
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you<br/>
I can tell cause your ways deceitful<br/>
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle<br/>
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him<br/>
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war<br/>
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy<br/>
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door<br/>
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score<br/>
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers<br/>
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"<br/>
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day<br/>
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays<br/>
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements<br/>
Or watch BET cause urban support is important<br/>
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?<br/>
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?<br/>
Hypocrite!
