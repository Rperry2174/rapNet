I got, I got, I got, I got<br/>
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br/>
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA<br/>
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA<br/>
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA<br/>
I was born like this, since one like this<br/>
Immaculate conception<br/>
I transform like this, perform like this<br/>
Was Yeshua's new weapon<br/>
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head<br/>
This that put-the-kids-to-bed<br/>
This that I got, I got, I got, I got<br/>
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA<br/>
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA<br/>
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA<br/>
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA<br/>
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve<br/>
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird<br/>
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard<br/>
I know how you work, I know just who you are<br/>
See, you's a, you's a, you's a-<br/>
Bitch, your hormones probably switch inside your DNA<br/>
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA<br/>
Daddy probably snitched, heritage inside your DNA<br/>
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge<br/>
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front<br/>
Shit I've been through probably offend you<br/>
This is Paula's oldest son<br/>
I know murder, conviction<br/>
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption<br/>
Scholars, fathers dead with kids<br/>
And I wish I was fed forgiveness<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA<br/>
Born inside the beast<br/>
My expertise checked out in second grade<br/>
When I was 9, on-sale motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay<br/>
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate<br/>
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to<br/>
Antisocial, extrovert<br/>
And excellent mean the extra work<br/>
And absentness what the fuck you heard<br/>
And pessimists never struck my nerve<br/>
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case<br/>
The reason my power's here on earth<br/>
Salute the truth, when the prophet say<br/>
<br/>
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br/>
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years<br/>
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br/>
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life<br/>
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA<br/>
I live a better, fuck your life<br/>
5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br/>
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'<br/>
Money and power, the mecca of marriages<br/>
<br/>
Tell me somethin'<br/>
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'<br/>
I'd rather die than to listen to you<br/>
My DNA not for imitation<br/>
Your DNA an abomination<br/>
This how it is when you're in the Matrix<br/>
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow<br/>
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go<br/>
And sleepin' in a villa<br/>
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'<br/>
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors<br/>
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window<br/>
Baby in the pool, godfather goals<br/>
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer<br/>
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras<br/>
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals<br/>
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana<br/>
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes<br/>
Phone never on, I don't conversate<br/>
I don't compromise, I just penetrate<br/>
Sex, money, murder-these are the breaks<br/>
These are the times, level number 9<br/>
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way<br/>
Sentence on the way, killings on the way<br/>
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way<br/>
You ain't shit without a body on your belt<br/>
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate<br/>
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself<br/>
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate<br/>
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate<br/>
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith<br/>
Peace to the world, let it rotate<br/>
Sex, money, murder-our DNA<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Video outro:]</i><br/>
DNA<br/>
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja<br/>
DNA<br/>
Gimme some ganja<br/>
Real nigga in my DNA<br/>
Ain't no ho inside my DNA<br/>
Drippin' gold inside my DNA<br/>
Power shows inside my DNA<br/>
DNA<br/>
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja<br/>
Real nigga in my DNA<br/>
Ain't no ho inside my DNA
