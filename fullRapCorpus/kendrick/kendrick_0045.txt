<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
What's your life about? Enlighten me<br/>
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?<br/>
There's fire in the street, fire in the swisher<br/>
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister<br/>
Just get a sip of this elixir<br/>
before they crop us out the picture<br/>
I've never seen a crop circle<br/>
but I've cops circle the block, I puff squares<br/>
But I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch<br/>
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment<br/>
Can you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)<br/>
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy<br/>
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary<br/>
<br/>
<i>[sung by female]</i><br/>
Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan<br/>
We raising hell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Lord forbid<br/>
The homie got wet, so we tryna soak it in<br/>
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin<br/>
You vote for the better man<br/>
Come to our show, you can see the diversity<br/>
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally<br/>
We might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it<br/>
I hope you participating<br/>
Aiyyo Dot, won't you let these cats know?<br/>
We knew we'd be here like back in '04<br/>
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator<br/>
and the system made to disintegrate us<br/>
And all we do is assist 'em<br/>
We're not victors, we're victims<br/>
The bigger picture isn't developed yet<br/>
Like, what if kids were celibate?<br/>
Or what is Tammy came across a real man<br/>
who didn't play games like chil-dren?<br/>
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend<br/>
with his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end<br/>
And everybody tripping off twenty-twelve<br/>
and the extraterrestrial presence as well<br/>
(Odd Future's aight) but our future's not<br/>
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got<br/>
So keep that question mark on your face<br/>
Eat your fast-food, use your fluoride toothpaste<br/>
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine-to-five<br/>
Don't forget to pay your tithes, and thank God you alive (HiiiPoWeR)<br/>
And on another note<br/>
we focussed like the Hubble Telescope, 'Soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar (female)]</i><br/>
Life is a traffic jam (life is a traffic jam)<br/>
Life is a traffic jam<br/>
Life is a traffic jam<br/>
Life is a traffic jam<br/>
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)<br/>
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)<br/>
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)<br/>
Life is a traffic jam<br/>
Life is a traffic jam<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
I wrote this because I was ordered to<br/>
People say I speak for generation Y<br/>
Why lie? I do<br/>
Section 80, your son will play me if radio won't<br/>
Daughters that just turned one to twenty-one listen to Kendrick<br/>
For instance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
What's your life about? Enlighten me<br/>
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?<br/>
Take out that student loan and pay off your college degree<br/>
and do exactly what you see on TV<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
True story<br/>
Hmm, can you repeat that for me 'Soul?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
What's your life about? Enlighten me<br/>
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?<br/>
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?<br/>
The time is now my child, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar<br/>
because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history<br/>
all in the same sentence<br/>
You know what all them things have in common?<br/>
Only half of the truth if you tell it<br/>
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers<br/>
till one day I realised I had to come up with my own<br/>
I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on inside looking out<br/>
I'm in the dead fucking centre looking around<br/>
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?<br/>
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react<br/>
My innocence been dead<br/>
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history<br/>
all in the same sentence<br/>
just know I meant it, and you felt it<br/>
cause you too are searching for answers<br/>
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper<br/>
I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation<br/>
Kendrick Lamar<br/>
Now fuck 'em up Terrace<br/>
('Soul!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I watch this fire that we're gathered around<br/>
and see that it burns similar to the fire that burns inside you<br/>
Section 80, Section 80 babies<br/>
A generation of bliss and disobedience<br/>
No they can't control us, no they can't control you<br/>
No they can't control us, but we control each other<br/>
We build our own world<br/>
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself<br/>
You will leave knowing you represent something that's bigger than all of us<br/>
or our family<br/>
Heart, honor and represent<br/>
This is you, this is me, and we are HiiiPoWeR
