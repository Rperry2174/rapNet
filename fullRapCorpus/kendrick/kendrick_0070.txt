I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence<br/>
Sometimes, I did the same<br/>
<br/>
If these walls could talk <i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anna Wise:]</i><br/>
Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway<br/>
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out<br/>
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey<br/>
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play<br/>
And shes plays only when you tell her no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Bilal:]</i><br/>
If these walls could talk<br/>
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you<br/>
If these walls could talk<br/>
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it<br/>
<br/>
If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good<br/>
No boat I float better than he would<br/>
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth<br/>
But your flood can be misunderstood<br/>
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment<br/>
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension<br/>
Me? I’m just a tenant<br/>
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute<br/>
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation<br/>
Interior pink, color coordinated<br/>
I interrogated every nook and cranny<br/>
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me<br/>
These walls want to cry tears<br/>
These walls happier when I’m here<br/>
These walls never could hold up<br/>
Everytime I come around demolition might crush<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep<br/>
Yelling at me continuously I can see<br/>
Your defense mechanism is my decision<br/>
Knock these walls down that’s my religion<br/>
Walls feeling like they ready to close in<br/>
I suffocate then catch my second wind<br/>
I resonate in these walls<br/>
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls<br/>
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in<br/>
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest<br/>
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them<br/>
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them<br/>
I’d rather call all you put your wall up<br/>
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late<br/>
Your destiny accepted your fate<br/>
Burn accessories and stash them where they are<br/>
Take the recipe, the bible and god<br/>
Wall telling you that commissary is low<br/>
Race wars happening no calling CO<br/>
No calling your mother to save you<br/>
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable<br/>
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch<br/>
Walls is telling me you a bitch<br/>
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them<br/>
That sentence so important<br/>
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"<br/>
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me<br/>
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life<br/>
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night<br/>
So when you play this song rewind the first verse<br/>
About me abusing my power so you can hurt<br/>
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny<br/>
About me and her in the after hours of the morning<br/>
About her baby daddy currently serving life<br/>
And how she think about you until we meet up at night<br/>
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her<br/>
And how she fucking on a famous rapper<br/>
Walls could talk<br/>
<br/>
I remember you was conflicted<br/>
Misusing your influence<br/>
Sometimes I did the same<br/>
Abusing my power full of resentment<br/>
Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br/>
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
