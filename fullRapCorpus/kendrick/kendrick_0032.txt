I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air<br/>
Stewardess complimentin’ me on my nappy hair<br/>
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers<br/>
They’ll prob’ly think I’m a terrorist<br/>
Eat my asparagus, then I’m askin’ her<br/>
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom<br/>
A crash dummy for diamonds, I know you dyin’ to meet ‘em<br/>
I’ll prob’ly die in a minute<br/>
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted<br/>
<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppin’<br/>
Section 80<br/>
<br/>
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch<br/>
Wit’ my back against the wall and yo’ bitch on the edge of my dick<br/>
Jump off<br/>
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman<br/>
I never did nothin’ but break the ground on top of the asphalt<br/>
Tire mark gave you evidence that I’m easily peddlin’ with the speed of a lightnin’ bolt<br/>
As a kid I killed two adults, I’m too advanced<br/>
I live my twenties at two years old, the wiser man<br/>
Truth be told, I’m like eighty-seven<br/>
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire wit’ devils holdin’ hands<br/>
From the distance, don’t know which one is a Christian, damn<br/>
Who can I trust in 2012? There’s no one<br/>
Not even myself, a Gemini screamin’ for help, somebody<br/>
<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppin’, everybody watchin’<br/>
When you do it like this, nigga, losin’ ain’t an option<br/>
<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppin’<br/>
(Ay, ay, kick her out the studio, Ali)<br/>
<br/>
24/7 nigga, workin’ his ass for it, she poppin’ that ass for it<br/>
The King of Diamonds wit’ diamonds I never do ask for<br/>
They checkin’ my passport, I’m too accustomed with Customs<br/>
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff ‘im<br/>
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain<br/>
When you niggas is past poor, you’ll never hop in my lane<br/>
When you pushin’ a RAV4, you wreckin’ my Jaguar<br/>
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard<br/>
<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppin’, everybody watchin’<br/>
When you do it like this, nigga, losin’ ain’t an option<br/>
<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppin’, everybody watchin’<br/>
When you do it like this, nigga…<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air<br/>
Stewardess complimentin’ me on my nappy hair<br/>
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers<br/>
They’ll prob’ly think I’m Osama<br/>
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor<br/>
<br/>
Hol’ up
