Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)<br/>
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon<br/>
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic<br/>
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...<br/>
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world<br/>
He done traveled all over the world<br/>
He came back just to give you some game<br/>
All of the little boys and girls, come up here<br/>
(One two, one two, what's happening, fool?)<br/>
Come right here, this is for you, come on up<br/>
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother<br/>
<br/>
I done been through a whole lot<br/>
Trial, tribulation, but I know God<br/>
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie<br/>
Pray that the holy water don't go dry<br/>
As I look around me<br/>
So many motherfuckers wanna down me<br/>
But an enemigo never drown me<br/>
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me<br/>
<br/>
And (I love myself)<br/>
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
One day at a time, uhh<br/>
<br/>
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street<br/>
Gun in the hood, mob of police<br/>
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend<br/>
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh<br/>
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)<br/>
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis<br/>
Dreams of reality's peace<br/>
Blow steam in the face of the beast<br/>
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now<br/>
Look at me motherfucker I smile<br/>
<br/>
And (I love myself)<br/>
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
One day at a time, uhh<br/>
<br/>
(Crazy)<br/>
(What you gon' do?)<br/>
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up<br/>
(Haunt you)<br/>
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart<br/>
On my sleeve, let the runway start<br/>
You know the miserable do love company<br/>
What do you want from me and my scars?<br/>
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence<br/>
How many times my potential was anonymous?<br/>
How many times the city making me promises?<br/>
So I promise this, nigga<br/>
<br/>
And (I love myself)<br/>
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
One day at a time, uhh<br/>
<br/>
Huh (Walk my bare feet) huh (Walk my bare feet)<br/>
Huh (Down, down valley deep) huh (Down, down valley deep)<br/>
(I love myself) huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) huh (fi-fie-fo-fum)<br/>
(I love myself) huh (My heart undone) one, two, three<br/>
<br/>
And (I love myself)<br/>
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy<br/>
(I love myself)<br/>
One day at a time, uhh<br/>
<br/>
I went to war last night<br/>
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic<br/>
I'm a do it till I get it right<br/>
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night, night)<br/>
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent<br/>
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message<br/>
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave<br/>
From a negative and letting them annihilate me<br/>
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed<br/>
Finna run into a building, lay my body...<br/>
<br/>
(Offstage Argument)<br/>
Not on my time, Not while I'm up here<br/>
Not on my time, kill the music<br/>
Not on my time<br/>
We could save that shit for the streets<br/>
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro<br/>
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog<br/>
Niggas ain't trying to play vic- TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?<br/>
Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?<br/>
No for real, answer the question, how many niggas we done lost bro?<br/>
This, this year alone<br/>
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga<br/>
Niggas gotta make time bro<br/>
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?<br/>
The judge make time so it ain't shit<br/>
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dawg<br/>
On the dead homies. Charlie P, you know that bro<br/>
You know that<br/>
It's mando. Right, it's mando<br/>
And I say this because I love you niggas man<br/>
I love all my niggas bro<br/>
Exac- enough said, enough said<br/>
We gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga<br/>
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check<br/>
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-<br/>
All my niggas listen<br/>
Listen to this:<br/>
<br/>
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"<br/>
He said, "Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'<br/>
No better than Samuel on Django<br/>
No better than a white man with slave boats"<br/>
Sound like I needed some soul searching<br/>
My Pops gave me some game in real person<br/>
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me<br/>
Did my homework fast before government caught me<br/>
So I'm a dedicate this one verse to Oprah<br/>
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us<br/>
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us<br/>
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia<br/>
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; King royalty - wait listen<br/>
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish<br/>
The history books overlook the word and hide it<br/>
America tried to make it to a house divided<br/>
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong<br/>
So I'm a break it down and put my game in a song<br/>
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me<br/>
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me<br/>
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time<br/>
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive
