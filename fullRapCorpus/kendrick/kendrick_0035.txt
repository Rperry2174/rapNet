<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I know this girl<br/>
She a real good girl<br/>
And she be low-key<br/>
Looking like a star<br/>
With a real nice car<br/>
A Mercedes key<br/>
And she got a nigga<br/>
And she love this nigga<br/>
Well, at least I think<br/>
Everytime we bark<br/>
She pay us no mind<br/>
In the middle of the street<br/>
She be like..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
Fuck them other niggas cause<br/>
I'm down for my nigga<br/>
Fuck them other niggas cause<br/>
I'm down for my nigga<br/>
Fuck them other niggas<br/>
I'll ride for my nigga<br/>
I'll die for my nigga<br/>
Fuck them other..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Until one day he wasn't acting right<br/>
In the middle of the night<br/>
She checked his phone, Erica, right<br/>
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on<br/>
Matter of fact she gone<br/>
Matter of fact Tyrone<br/>
Was on speed dial, so when she got home<br/>
It was going down, she go..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
Fuck that other nigga<br/>
When she tired of her nigga<br/>
Fuck that other nigga<br/>
When she tired of her nigga<br/>
Fuck that other nigga<br/>
When she tired of her nigga<br/>
Sick of lies from her nigga<br/>
Fuck that other..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I know this girl<br/>
She a real hood girl<br/>
And she with the shit<br/>
Keep her hair tied up<br/>
Big bamboos<br/>
Mike Jordan kicks with that<br/>
Big butt, but when I try<br/>
To holla, she don't exist<br/>
In her man she trust<br/>
So when I holla<br/>
She gon resist and her man she trust<br/>
So when I walk by her<br/>
She be screaming this..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4]</i><br/>
Until one day he wasn't acting right<br/>
In the middle of the night<br/>
She checked his pockets<br/>
Found condoms by Magnum<br/>
And the moment they was acknowledged<br/>
She popped his eye<br/>
Then ran outside<br/>
Then started driving<br/>
On the passenger side<br/>
Homeboy was smiling, she go..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5]</i><br/>
And so, these girls<br/>
These vulnerable girls<br/>
Took they men up<br/>
Put em in their world<br/>
Their vulnerable world<br/>
And just like that it was<br/>
Only getting they feelings hurt<br/>
Tell me how that sound?<br/>
They got fed up with the<br/>
Biggest question mark<br/>
They curious now<br/>
Cause when women get sick of men<br/>
They think of a big helping hand<br/>
To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim<br/>
So when she telling her to come over<br/>
It'll be alright<br/>
The minute she hit the block<br/>
And turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3]</i><br/>
Fuck with other bitches<br/>
When they tired of these niggas<br/>
Fuck with other bitches<br/>
When they tired of these niggas<br/>
Fuck with other bitches<br/>
On the side cause these niggas..<br/>
<br/>
Tammy's song
