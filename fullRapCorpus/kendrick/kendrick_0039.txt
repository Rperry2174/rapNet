<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know a lot of people that smile in my face<br/>
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone<br/>
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up<br/>
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone<br/>
I'm going big, suck my dick<br/>
I'm going big, suck my dick<br/>
I'm going big, suck my dick<br/>
I'm going big, suck my dick<br/>
Too many niggas, not enough hoes<br/>
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes<br/>
Stay to myself like loners do<br/>
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood<br/>
To politic or be fake with you<br/>
We apologize if you ever knew<br/>
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes<br/>
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Everything I do is alumni<br/>
I'm a take my time, I'm a master it<br/>
You should be mindful of a mastermind<br/>
Put a landmine right where your momma live<br/>
Now blow up, blow up, hold up<br/>
I seen your kind before<br/>
See me as a dollar sign<br/>
Till I resign on your report<br/>
That I done you wrong, and I mean to know<br/>
My homie never<br/>
Nigga right now, it's now or never<br/>
Nigga right now, I'm high as ever<br/>
But however...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre<br/>
And they wanna tell me, I made it<br/>
Nigga I ain't made shit<br/>
If he gave me a handout<br/>
I'm a take his wrist and break it<br/>
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo<br/>
Chilling with two hoes in here<br/>
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix<br/>
As them pills disappear<br/>
Me and my niggas just acting bad<br/>
HiiiPower conglomerate<br/>
Living that life and counting this cash<br/>
Old friends I no longer have<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q (Kendrick Lamar)]</i><br/>
I remember when I came out and shit<br/>
Man it's been so long since they see my dick<br/>
Probably been five months since I seen my seed<br/>
God dammit K Dot when it comes to this<br/>
When I was sleeping on couches<br/>
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch<br/>
Nigga I was motherfucking outchea<br/>
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer<br/>
When I should've been making bangers<br/>
I was somewhere stuck with a flame here<br/>
Motherfucker see how far that I came here<br/>
Went broke and I came up in the same year<br/>
Can I get a hell yea?<br/>
Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride<br/>
(Music saved my fucking life<br/>
I'm doing right<br/>
And you left behind<br/>
Feel my pain, now I'm styling<br/>
Heard this shit, I spent a thousand<br/>
Different homes, different islands)<br/>
Dropped my mix-tape and it sold like an album<br/>
Reason why I'm...<br/>
<br/>
Going big, bitch suck my dick<br/>
Yea I'm going big, bitch suck my dick<br/>
Tell em I'm going big, bitch suck my dick<br/>
Yea I'm going big, bitch suck my dick<br/>
<br/>
