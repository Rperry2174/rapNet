Shut your fuckin’ mouth and get some cash, you bitch, you<br/>
You be in your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch, you<br/>

Me don’t want problems (me don’t want problems)<br/>

Compton is where I’m from<br/>

<i>[Part II:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Young Egypt<br/>
Look, look<br/>
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I’m charged<br/>
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large<br/>
Came in the game with a plan of beatin’ the odds<br/>
What an accomplishment, broken promises<br/>
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence<br/>
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is<br/>
You niggas fear me like y’all fear God<br/>
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice<br/>
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin’ your bars<br/>
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra<br/>
Before you step out of line and dance with the star<br/>
I could never end a career if it never start<br/>
The murderous capital, avenues lookin’ like evil dead zombies<br/>
With batteries to the head<br/>
The flattery of watchin’ my stock rise<br/>
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size<br/>
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid<br/>
Just premium gas, do it for dolo<br/>
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo<br/>
Black excellence, pessimist died countin’ my coin<br/>
Hope it’s evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better<br/>
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather<br/>
Forecasted my future, this is the future<br/>
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you<br/>
Gunshots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Part III:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Come on, come on, come on<br/>
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
Come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
This is a fifteen minute song<br/>
We’re just jammin’ out, we on stage<br/>
Taz, we just jammin’ out<br/>
Hundred thousand<br/>
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!<br/>
Look, look, look, go back to the down note<br/>
They all sing this shit, everybody<br/>
<br/>
Now I don’t let you down, and for<br/>
You see, you see, you see, you see<br/>
But I don’t shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you<br/>
They say the government ain’t the truth, truth, truth, truth<br/>
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth<br/>
<br/>
But head is the answer<br/>
Head is the future<br/>
Don’t second guess yourself<br/>
Come on, give me some help<br/>
Hey one more time, band, I need y’all to help me out right now<br/>
Head is the answer<br/>
Head is the future, it’s the future, that nigga said<br/>
Don’t second guess yourself<br/>
Come on, give me some help<br/>
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
Come on, come on, my background singer<br/>
Come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
<br/>
I said, girl you make me wanna uh<br/>
The ho screaming now<br/>
I said baby you make..<br/>
You make me wanna just AHHH!<br/>
Baby you got me speechless right now<br/>
Laughs<br/>
I gotta take it there, I ain’t even playin’ no more<br/>
Said you just make me wanna Drake you down<br/>
To the ground, to the ground ground<br/>
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam<br/>
You just make me wanna Drake you down<br/>
Down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam<br/>
And baby if your mama’s around, if your mama’s around<br/>
If your mama’s around, if your mama’s around<br/>
Tell her, tell her<br/>
No discrimination, she’s young nigga chasin’<br/>
And she can get this dick too!<br/>
<br/>
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
Yeah, nigga<br/>
You gotta do it, man<br/>
We gonna lay that shit<br/>
We gonna lay that shit, and watch what it’s gon’ do
